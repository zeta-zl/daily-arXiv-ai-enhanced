While\nprior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable\nrepresentations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and\npropagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,\nwe propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how\npredictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations\nand target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to\ntrace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during\ntraining. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a\nconsistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle\nlayers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,\nreflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further\ninvestigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling\ncoefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which\nserve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual\ntransformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,\nmodels downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,\nhighlighting their role in generalization.

Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising\nseven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base\nmodel for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant\nfindings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks.

(2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the\nmodel's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).\nConversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis\nshows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought\nreasoning, are not the primary factors.

Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal\nrelational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations\nthat produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and\ninterventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training\nsamples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation\nbetween this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the\nindependence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For\nlinear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of\ninterventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional\nindependence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and\nits non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these\ninsights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce\nthis statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility\nof RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial\nattribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments\nshow that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and\nis suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional\ndistribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables."}

To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial\ndata which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security\nand returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an\nindex system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million\npublicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset\nis reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data\n(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data\nin our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and\nutilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different\nindicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of\nTLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.\nExtensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach\nto at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different\nevaluation metrics."}

This study\ncompares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a\nreasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.\n  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI\n(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The\nanonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human\nexperts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical\nrubric.\n  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored\npeer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;\np=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th\n(mean 6.97).

A plethora of hardware accelerators has been\nintroduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.\nHowever, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally\noverlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to\nhardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output\nby modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory\ndevice. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware\nbit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight\ngradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of\nbits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is\ncreated to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted\nfrom memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a\nspecific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the\nselected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node\nclassification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that\nGBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its\nimpact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a\nlayer-aware attack strategy in GNNs.

To control\ntheir propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active\ntopic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD\nmethods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models\ntrained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this\nissue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,\ninducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by\ntwo major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the\ndetection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,\nthe social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the\ngeneralization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to\nremember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific\nparameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and\nanticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time\ndynamics model.

This two-step\napproach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,\ncan be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as\nregression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by\napplying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.\nExperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding\ntechniques."}

In this paper, we\nintroduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework\nthat uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and\nlocal features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that\nconvert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point\nclouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the\nreconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our\narchitecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate\nglobal and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and\nfine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset\ncontaining human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of\nreconstruction accuracy."}

Grid-, neighborhood-, and\nobject-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and\nhigher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain\nsharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.\nWhile GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for\nfuture graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient,\ndata-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble\ncapability."}

Recently, metamorphic testing\nthat defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate\nthe robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing\nstill requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization\nof selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,\nmost studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in\ntheir evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based\napproach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and\nminimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the\ncombinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in\nthe robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing.

Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters\n  (RA-L)", "summary": "Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,\nbut its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy\nand centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a\nprivacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the\nsubstantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for\nresource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL\nframework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's\nfunctional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to\nwhich our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is\nrealized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is\nfollowed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of\nslower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.\nExtensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method\noutperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for\na given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical\nrobot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to\nbaseline methods in cluttered scenes.

A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain", "categories": ["q-bio.NC", "cs.AI"], "comment": "18 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows\nup a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex\nfeatures. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of\nconnections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many\nanatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical\ninterpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond\nin parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other\nevidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at\nthe same time. Given this flexibility, the word \"heterarchy\" might be a more\nsuitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new\ninterpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the\nneocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the \"Thousand Brains\nTheory\", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning\nsystem. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a\nsensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,\ncan learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the\nhierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional\nstructure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the\ntheory by examining the different types of long-range connections between\ncortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these\nconnections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a\nheterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an\nessential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel\nperspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and\nartificial intelligence."}

Our\nfindings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to\nadvance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on\nhttps://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba."}
