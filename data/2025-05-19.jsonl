However, existing methods\nstruggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the\nprobabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either\nemploy shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on\ndeterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation\nparadigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic\nmultimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed\nabstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal\npatterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual\ncontexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal\nrepresentations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen\nLLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs'\ninherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series\nforecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of\nCAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios.

However, all such techniques can only work with a single (human)\nobjective. In practice, human users have multiple objectives, such as\nhelpfulness and harmlessness, and there is no natural way to aggregate them\ninto a single objective. In this paper, we address the multi-objective\npreference-alignment problem, where a policy must optimize several, potentially\nconflicting, objectives. We introduce the Multi-Objective Preference\nOptimization (MOPO) algorithm, which frames alignment as a constrained\nKL-regularized optimization: the primary objective is maximized while secondary\nobjectives are lower-bounded by tunable safety thresholds. Unlike prior work,\nMOPO operates directly on pairwise preference data, requires no point-wise\nreward assumption, and avoids heuristic prompt-context engineering. The method\nrecovers policies on the Pareto front whenever the front is attainable;\npractically, it reduces to simple closed-form iterative updates suitable for\nlarge-scale training. On synthetic benchmarks with diverse canonical preference\nstructures, we show that MOPO approximates the Pareto front. When fine-tuning a\n1.3B-parameter language model on real-world human-preference datasets, MOPO\nattains higher rewards and yields policies that Pareto-dominate baselines;\nablation studies confirm optimization stability and robustness to\nhyperparameters."}

To address this, we leverage a transfer learning approach using\nsequence-to-sequence pre-training language model.

A high rate\nof missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models\ntend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher\nthan the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals\na strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only\n28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine\nrare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are\naddressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance\ndetection accuracy in IoT domains. After applying these techniques, we evaluate\nthe performance of several machine learning models such as Random Forest, Soft\nVoting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression with respect to the classification of\ncyber-attacks. The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model\nachieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of\n0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting\nmodel, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of\ncombining model predictions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of\nhybrid sampling combined with robust model and feature selection for\nsignificantly improving IoT security against cyber-attacks, especially in\nhighly imbalanced data environments."}

In this work, we reinterpret alignment gaps\nin VFL as missing data problems and propose a unified framework that\naccommodates both training and inference under arbitrary alignment and labeling\nscenarios, while supporting diverse missingness mechanisms. In the experiments\non 168 configurations spanning four benchmark datasets, six training-time\nmissingness patterns, and seven testing-time missingness patterns, our method\noutperforms all baselines in 160 cases with an average gap of 9.6 percentage\npoints over the next-best competitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first VFL framework to jointly handle arbitrary data alignment, unlabeled\ndata, and multi-party collaboration all at once."}

The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials\nGenomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the\nability of an LLM to understand materials science tools.

We develop a pipeline employing image\nprocessing and OCR techniques to extract articles and advertisements from\ndigital versions of print newspapers with high accuracy. Applying this\nmethodology to five popular newspapers that span multiple regions and three\nlanguages, English, Hindi, and Telugu, we assembled a dataset of more than\n12,000 editions containing several hundred thousand advertisements.\nCollectively, these newspapers reach a readership of over 100 million people.\nUsing this extensive dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to answer key\nquestions about print advertising: who advertises, what they advertise, when\nthey advertise, where they place their ads, and how they advertise. Our\nfindings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print\nadvertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the\noverrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate\nrevenue contributed by government ads. Furthermore, we examine whether\nadvertising in a newspaper influences the coverage an advertiser receives.\nThrough regression analyses on coverage volume and sentiment, we find strong\nevidence supporting this hypothesis for corporate advertisers. The results\nindicate a clear trend where increased advertising correlates with more\nfavorable and extensive media coverage, a relationship that remains robust over\ntime and across different levels of advertiser popularity."}

To improve\ngeneralization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a\nHierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies\ntransferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then\ngenerates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive\nexperiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate\nthat HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing\nto previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and\ndeformation where others fail.

To address this, we propose FairHyp, a fairness-directed\nframework that explicitly disentangles and resolves the threefold\nnon-uniformity through cooperative yet specialized modules. We introduce a\nRunge-Kutta-inspired spatial variability adapter to restore spatial coherence\nunder resolution discrepancies, a multi-receptive field convolution module with\nsparse-aware refinement to enhance discriminative features while respecting\ninherent sparsity, and a spectral-context state space model that captures\nstable and long-range spectral dependencies via bidirectional Mamba scanning\nand statistical aggregation.

This design is grounded in the view that non-uniformity\narises from the intrinsic structure of HSI representations, rather than any\nparticular task setting.

Extensive\nvalidation reveals that our enhanced SAM-6D surpasses FoundationPose in\nzero-shot pose estimation of unseen surgical instruments, setting a new\nbenchmark for zero-shot RGB-D pose estimation in RMIS. This work enhances the\ngeneralisability of pose estimation for unseen objects and pioneers the\napplication of RGB-D zero-shot methods in RMIS."}

On\nthe exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one\ndifficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find\nthousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on\nthe monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the\nsame attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an\nLLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the\nparticular content of each exploited device.\n  We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical\nusing state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human\nintervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron\nemail dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that\ncould be used for blackmail.

However, fine-grained decomposition of a large\ncomputation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads.\nFurther, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs),\nadding to the overhead.\n  We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a\nToken-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into\ntwo approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The computation of one\nsubset is then overlapped with the communication of the other. In addition,\nTokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with\nrespect to communication operations and implements a novel fused\nAllReduce-RMSNorm kernel carefully leveraging Multimem instruction support\navailable on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to\nperform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel\nenables the memory bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's\ncomputation, providing additional gains. Our evaluations demonstrate up to 29%\nlatency gains and up to 26% throughput gains across multiple models and\nworkloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance\ncompared to an equivalent model with all communication removed."}

Delta compression attempts to lower the\ncosts by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference\nbetween the finetuned and pre-trained model weights) through pruning or\nquantization. However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model\nas the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may\ncauses significant performance degradation, especially when the compression\nrate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of\ndifferent base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the\npre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic\nBase Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target\ntask before performing delta compression. Specifically, we adjust two\nparameters, which respectively determine the magnitude of the base model shift\nand the overall scale of delta compression, to boost the compression\nperformance on each task. Through low-cost learning of these two parameters,\nour DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an\nextremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing\nmethods.

However, GPs suffer when the amount of training\ndata is large or when the underlying function contains multi-scale features\nthat are difficult to represent by a stationary kernel. To address the former,\ntraining of GPs with large-scale data is often performed through inducing point\napproximations (also known as sparse GP regression (GPR)), where the size of\nthe covariance matrices in GPR is reduced considerably through a greedy search\non the data set. To aid the latter, deep GPs have gained traction as\nhierarchical models that resolve multi-scale features by combining multiple\nGPs. Posterior inference in deep GPs requires a sampling or, more usual, a\nvariational approximation. Variational approximations lead to large-scale\nstochastic, non-convex optimisation problems and the resulting approximation\ntends to represent uncertainty incorrectly. In this work, we combine\nvariational learning with MCMC to develop a particle-based\nexpectation-maximisation method to simultaneously find inducing points within\nthe large-scale data (variationally) and accurately train the GPs\n(sampling-based). The result is a highly efficient and accurate methodology for\ndeep GP training on large-scale data. We test our method on standard benchmark\nproblems."}
