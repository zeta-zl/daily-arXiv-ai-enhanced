However, existing methods\nstruggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the\nprobabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs).

To\naddress these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic\nmultimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed\nabstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal\npatterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual\ncontexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal\nrepresentations.

However, all such techniques can only work with a single (human)\nobjective. In practice, human users have multiple objectives, such as\nhelpfulness and harmlessness, and there is no natural way to aggregate them\ninto a single objective. In this paper, we address the multi-objective\npreference-alignment problem, where a policy must optimize several, potentially\nconflicting, objectives. We introduce the Multi-Objective Preference\nOptimization (MOPO) algorithm, which frames alignment as a constrained\nKL-regularized optimization: the primary objective is maximized while secondary\nobjectives are lower-bounded by tunable safety thresholds. Unlike prior work,\nMOPO operates directly on pairwise preference data, requires no point-wise\nreward assumption, and avoids heuristic prompt-context engineering. The method\nrecovers policies on the Pareto front whenever the front is attainable;\npractically, it reduces to simple closed-form iterative updates suitable for\nlarge-scale training. On synthetic benchmarks with diverse canonical preference\nstructures, we show that MOPO approximates the Pareto front. When fine-tuning a\n1.3B-parameter language model on real-world human-preference datasets, MOPO\nattains higher rewards and yields policies that Pareto-dominate baselines;\nablation studies confirm optimization stability and robustness to\nhyperparameters."}

To address this, we leverage a transfer learning approach using\nsequence-to-sequence pre-training language model.

A high rate\nof missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models\ntend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher\nthan the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals\na strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only\n28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine\nrare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are\naddressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance\ndetection accuracy in IoT domains. After applying these techniques, we evaluate\nthe performance of several machine learning models such as Random Forest, Soft\nVoting, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP), and Logistic Regression with respect to the classification of\ncyber-attacks. The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model\nachieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of\n0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting\nmodel, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of\ncombining model predictions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of\nhybrid sampling combined with robust model and feature selection for\nsignificantly improving IoT security against cyber-attacks, especially in\nhighly imbalanced data environments."}

We introduce\nFairSHAP, a novel pre-processing framework that leverages Shapley value\nattribution to improve both individual and group fairness. FairSHAP identifies\nfairness-critical instances in the training data using an interpretable measure\nof feature importance, and systematically modifies them through instance-level\nmatching across sensitive groups. This process reduces discriminative risk - an\nindividual fairness metric - while preserving data integrity and model\naccuracy. We demonstrate that FairSHAP significantly improves demographic\nparity and equality of opportunity across diverse tabular datasets, achieving\nfairness gains with minimal data perturbation and, in some cases, improved\npredictive performance. As a model-agnostic and transparent method, FairSHAP\nintegrates seamlessly into existing machine learning pipelines and provides\nactionable insights into the sources of bias.Our code is on\nhttps://github.com/youlei202/FairSHAP."}

To support robust evaluation,\nwe utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs\ncarefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion\nhallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on\nEmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial\nissues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform\nopen-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability\nprovides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion\npsychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct,\nthese findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an\naverage improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected\nmodels.

We develop a pipeline employing image\nprocessing and OCR techniques to extract articles and advertisements from\ndigital versions of print newspapers with high accuracy. Applying this\nmethodology to five popular newspapers that span multiple regions and three\nlanguages, English, Hindi, and Telugu, we assembled a dataset of more than\n12,000 editions containing several hundred thousand advertisements.\nCollectively, these newspapers reach a readership of over 100 million people.\nUsing this extensive dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to answer key\nquestions about print advertising: who advertises, what they advertise, when\nthey advertise, where they place their ads, and how they advertise. Our\nfindings reveal significant patterns, including the consistent level of print\nadvertising over the past six years despite declining print circulation, the\noverrepresentation of company ads on prominent pages, and the disproportionate\nrevenue contributed by government ads. Furthermore, we examine whether\nadvertising in a newspaper influences the coverage an advertiser receives.\nThrough regression analyses on coverage volume and sentiment, we find strong\nevidence supporting this hypothesis for corporate advertisers. The results\nindicate a clear trend where increased advertising correlates with more\nfavorable and extensive media coverage, a relationship that remains robust over\ntime and across different levels of advertiser popularity."}

However, existing\nresearch in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity,\nprimarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment\nmanipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment\nspecifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation,\nwhich features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and\nrefines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the\nsim-to-real gap.

The Sequence model then ingests the summary-augmented\ntime series for each unit independently to predict its outcome. Both components\nare learned jointly over arbitrary sets sampled during training. Our approach\nharnesses the set nature of the cross-section and is computationally efficient,\ngenerating set summaries in linear time relative to the number of units.

Through theoretical and empirical\nanalysis, we surprisingly uncover that weight decay's primary function is to\nencode popularity information into the magnitudes of the embedding vectors.\nMoreover, we find that tuning weight decay acts as a coarse, non-linear knob to\ninfluence preference towards popular or unpopular items. Based on these\nfindings, we propose PRISM (Popularity-awaRe Initialization Strategy for\nembedding Magnitudes), a straightforward yet effective solution to simplify the\ntraining of high-performing CF models. PRISM pre-encodes the popularity\ninformation typically learned through weight decay, eliminating its necessity.\nOur experiments show that PRISM improves performance by up to 4.77% and reduces\ntraining times by 38.48%, compared to state-of-the-art training strategies.\nAdditionally, we parameterize PRISM to modulate the initialization strength,\noffering a cost-effective and meaningful strategy to mitigate popularity bias."}
