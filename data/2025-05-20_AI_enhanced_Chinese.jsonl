A critical\nbottleneck is the scarcity of high-quality training datasets that facilitate\nproactive questioning and implicit intention mining. While recent advances\nleverage LLM-driven data synthesis to generate such datasets and transfer\nspecialized knowledge to downstream models, existing approaches suffer from\nseveral shortcomings: (1) lack of adaptation to the tourism domain, (2) skewed\ndistributions of detail levels in initial inquiries, (3) contextual redundancy\nin the implicit intention mining module, and (4) lack of explicit thinking\nabout tourists' emotions and intention values. Therefore, we propose SynPT (A\nData Synthesis Method Driven by LLMs for Proactive Mining of Implicit User\nIntentions in the Tourism), which constructs an LLM-driven user agent and\nassistant agent to simulate dialogues based on seed data collected from Chinese\ntourism websites. This approach addresses the aforementioned limitations and\ngenerates SynPT-Dialog, a training dataset containing explicit reasoning. The\ndataset is utilized to fine-tune a general LLM, enabling it to proactively mine\nimplicit user intentions. Experimental evaluations, conducted from both human\nand LLM perspectives, demonstrate the superiority of SynPT compared to existing\nmethods.

Often, this involves making choices on\nbehalf of human users. However, not much is known about the distribution of\nsuch choices, and how susceptible they are to different choice architectures.\nWe perform a case study with a few such LLM models on a multi-attribute tabular\ndecision-making problem, under canonical nudges such as the default option,\nsuggestions, and information highlighting, as well as additional prompting\nstrategies. We show that, despite superficial similarities to human choice\ndistributions, such models differ in subtle but important ways. First, they\nshow much higher susceptibility to the nudges. Second, they diverge in points\nearned, being affected by factors like the idiosyncrasy of available prizes.\nThird, they diverge in information acquisition strategies: e.g. incurring\nsubstantial cost to reveal too much information, or selecting without revealing\nany. Moreover, we show that simple prompt strategies like zero-shot chain of\nthought (CoT) can shift the choice distribution, and few-shot prompting with\nhuman data can induce greater alignment.

Besides, the assumption of independent and identically\ndistributed (IID) data also contradicts the strong correlation of the time\ndomain labels. To address these issues, abandoning time domain supervision, we\npropose a purely frequency domain supervision approach named cross-dimensional\nfrequency (X-Freq) loss. Specifically, based on a statistical phenomenon, we\nfirst prove that the information entropy of the time series is higher than its\nspectral entropy, which implies higher certainty in frequency domain and thus\ncan provide better supervision. Secondly, the Fourier Transform and the Wavelet\nTransform are applied to the time dimension and the channel dimension of the\ntime series respectively, to capture the long-term and short-term frequency\nvariations as well as the spatial configuration features. Thirdly, the loss\nbetween predictions and targets is uniformly computed in the frequency domain.\nMoreover, we plug-and-play incorporate X-Freq into multiple advanced\nforecasting models and compare on 14 real-world datasets. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that, without making any modification to the original\narchitectures or hyperparameters, X-Freq can improve the forecasting\nperformance by an average of 3.3% on long-term forecasting datasets and 27.7%\non short-term ones, showcasing superior generality and practicality.

Our survey reviews 36\nresearch papers covering 39 prompting techniques applied to 30 multilingual NLP\ntasks, with the majority of these studies published in the last two years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6LLMs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u4e8639\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8986\u76d6250\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6c34\u5e73\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e3a\u65e0\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5229\u7528LLMs\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e24\u5e74\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "keywords": ["LLMs", "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b", "NLP\u4efb\u52a1", "\u8bed\u8a00\u5bb6\u65cf", "\u8d44\u6e90\u6c34\u5e73"]}}

For instance, if you want to make coffee at a friend's place, you\nmight initially plan to grab coffee beans, go to the coffee machine, and pour\nthem into the machine. Upon noticing that the machine is full, you would skip\nthe initial steps and proceed directly to brewing. In stark contrast, state of\nthe art reinforcement learners, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO),\nlack such prior knowledge and therefore require significantly more training\nsteps to exhibit comparable adaptive behavior. Thus, a central research\nquestion arises: \\textit{How can we enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents\nto have similar ``human priors'', allowing the agent to learn with fewer\ntraining interactions?} To address this challenge, we propose differentiable\nsymbolic planner (Dylan), a novel framework that integrates symbolic planning\ninto Reinforcement Learning.

We propose three methods to extract these\nemerging entities, complementing each other based on label availability and\ndimensionality. Discrete sequence chunking (DSC) creates a dictionary of\nentities; population averaging (PA) extracts recurring entities that correspond\nto known labels; and unsupervised chunk discovery (UCD) can be used when labels\nare absent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in extracting\nentities across varying model sizes, ranging from inducing compositionality in\nRNNs to uncovering recurring neural population states in large models with\ndiverse architectures, and illustrate their advantage over other methods.\nThroughout, we observe a robust correspondence between the extracted entities\nand concrete or abstract concepts.

Interestingly, the\nhuman-aligned reward penalizes aspects typically associated with strong\nreviews, leading REMOR-U to produce qualitatively more substantive feedback.\nOur results show that REMOR-U and REMOR-H achieve more than twice the average\nrewards of human reviews, non-reasoning state-of-the-art agentic multi-modal AI\nreview systems, and general commercial LLM baselines. We found that while the\nbest AI and human reviews are comparable in quality, REMOR avoids the long tail\nof low-quality human reviews. We discuss how reasoning is key to achieving\nthese improvements and release the Human-aligned Peer Review Reward (HPRR)\nfunction, the Peer Review Reasoning-enriched Traces (PeerRT) dataset, and the\nREMOR models, which we believe can help spur progress in the area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08REMOR\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u6539\u8fdbAI\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cREMOR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53cd\u9988\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u548c\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7cfb\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6d45\u663e\u4e14\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8d5e\u626c\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u76f8\u6bd4\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u5347AI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728PeerRT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Group Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1aREMOR-H\uff08\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u548cREMOR-U\uff08\u5747\u5300\u5956\u52b1\uff09\u3002", "result": "REMOR-H\u548cREMOR-U\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cREMOR\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5176\u6700\u4f73\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfAI\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86HPRR\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3001PeerRT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cREMOR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "keywords": ["AI\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1", "\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60", "REMOR", "PeerRT", "HPRR"]}}

However, the efficiency of training large models is\nalso important. To explore whether low-bit attention can be effectively applied\nto training tasks, we design an accurate and efficient 8-bit attention for both\nforward and backward propagation. Experiments indicate that 8-bit attention\nachieves lossless performance in fine-tuning tasks but exhibits slower\nconvergence in pretraining tasks.

However, existing methods typically\nrely on auxiliary mechanisms to identify important or irrelevant task-specific\ntokens, introducing potential bias and limiting applicability. In this paper,\nwe uncover a surprising and elegant alternative: the semantically empty initial\ntoken is a powerful and underexplored control point for optimizing model\nbehavior. Through theoretical analysis, we show that tuning the initial token's\nattention sharpens or flattens the attention distribution over subsequent\ntokens, and its role as an attention sink amplifies this effect. Empirically,\nwe find that: (1) tuning its attention improves LLM performance more\neffectively than tuning other task-specific tokens; (2) the effect follows a\nconsistent trend across layers, with earlier layers having greater impact, but\nvaries across attention heads, with different heads showing distinct\npreferences in how they attend to this token. Based on these findings, we\npropose ZeroTuning, a training-free approach that improves LLM performance by\napplying head-specific attention adjustments to this special token. Despite\ntuning only one token, ZeroTuning achieves higher performance on text\nclassification, multiple-choice, and multi-turn conversation tasks across\nmodels such as Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek.

To address these limitations, we propose a new framework that can: 1)\npreserve feature subset knowledge in a continuous embedding space while\nensuring permutation invariance; 2) effectively explore the embedding space\nwithout relying on strong convex assumptions. For the first objective, we\ndevelop an encoder-decoder paradigm to preserve feature selection knowledge\ninto a continuous embedding space. This paradigm captures feature interactions\nthrough pairwise relationships within the subset, removing the influence of\nfeature order on the embedding. Moreover, an inducing point mechanism is\nintroduced to accelerate pairwise relationship computations. For the second\nobjective, we employ a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach to\nguide the exploration of the embedding space. The RL agent effectively\nnavigates the space by balancing multiple objectives.

When Language Models (LMs) are prompted\nwith multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant\ninformation but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information\nsources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the\ncausal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In\nthis paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting\nsearch results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study\nreveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the\nones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in\nMHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order\nof gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned\ndecoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order\naligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models\nwith bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively\nboost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough\ninvestigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of\nMHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher\nvalues when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to\nheuristically improve LMs' performance on this task.

Understanding this phenomenon has\nattracted considerable attention in recent years. In this work, we introduce a\nconceptual shift, by focusing on almost benign overfitting, where models\nsimultaneously achieve both arbitrarily small training and test errors. This\nbehavior is characteristic of neural networks, which often achieve low (but\nnon-zero) training error while still generalizing well. We hypothesize that\nthis almost benign overfitting can emerge even in classical regimes, by\nanalyzing how the interaction between sample size and model complexity enables\nlarger models to achieve both good training fit but still approach\nBayes-optimal generalization. We substantiate this hypothesis with theoretical\nevidence from two case studies: (i) kernel ridge regression, and (ii)\nleast-squares regression using a two-layer fully connected ReLU neural network\ntrained via gradient flow.

In\nthis paper, we introduce a quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN)\narchitecture for multivariate time-series anomaly detection that leverages\nvariational quantum circuits (VQCs) in combination with a time-window shifting\ntechnique, data re-uploading, and successive data injection (SuDaI). The method\nencodes multivariate time series data as rotation angles. By integrating both\ndata re-uploading and SuDaI, the approach maps classical data into quantum\nstates efficiently, helping to address hardware limitations such as the\nrestricted number of available qubits. In addition, the approach employs an\nanomaly scoring technique that utilizes both the generator and the\ndiscriminator output to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection.

Previous\nworks on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling\nperspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question\ntypes. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop\nQA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types\nof cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step,\nIterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step.

Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to\naddress multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between\nquestion types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an\n''operator'' by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes\nmultiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined\n''operators'' to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the\ndebate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative\ndebater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow\ndebaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable.

Consequently, the model built upon CoM framework can\nprogressively scale up the model size by increasing the chains based on the\nprevious models (i.e., chains), and offer multiple sub-models at varying sizes\nfor elastic inference by using different chain numbers. Based on this\nprinciple, we devise Chain-of-Language-Model (CoLM), which incorporates the\nidea of CoM into each layer of Transformer architecture. Based on CoLM, we\nfurther introduce CoLM-Air by introducing a KV sharing mechanism, that computes\nall keys and values within the first chain and then shares across all chains.\nThis design demonstrates additional extensibility, such as enabling seamless LM\nswitching, prefilling acceleration and so on. Experimental results demonstrate\nour CoLM family can achieve comparable performance to the standard Transformer,\nwhile simultaneously enabling greater flexiblity, such as progressive scaling\nto improve training efficiency and offer multiple varying model sizes for\nelastic inference, paving a a new way toward building language models.

Using curated training\nexamples and a feedback-driven reward model, VeriReason combines testbench\nevaluations with structural heuristics while embedding self-checking\ncapabilities for autonomous error correction. On the VerilogEval Benchmark,\nVeriReason delivers significant improvements: achieving 83.1% functional\ncorrectness on the VerilogEval Machine benchmark, substantially outperforming\nboth comparable-sized models and much larger commercial systems like GPT-4\nTurbo. Additionally, our approach demonstrates up to a 2.8X increase in\nfirst-attempt functional correctness compared to baseline methods and exhibits\nrobust generalization to unseen designs. To our knowledge, VeriReason\nrepresents the first system to successfully integrate explicit reasoning\ncapabilities with reinforcement learning for Verilog generation, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art for automated RTL synthesis.

One notable vulnerability is the ability to bypass LLM\nsafeguards by translating harmful queries into rare or underrepresented\nlanguages, a simple yet effective method of \"jailbreaking\" these models.\nDespite the growing concern, there has been limited research addressing the\nsafeguarding of LLMs in multilingual scenarios, highlighting an urgent need to\nenhance multilingual safety. In this work, we investigate the correlation\nbetween various attack features across different languages and propose\nMultilingual Collaborative Defense (MCD), a novel learning method that\noptimizes a continuous, soft safety prompt automatically to facilitate\nmultilingual safeguarding of LLMs. The MCD approach offers three advantages:\nFirst, it effectively improves safeguarding performance across multiple\nlanguages. Second, MCD maintains strong generalization capabilities while\nminimizing false refusal rates. Third, MCD mitigates the language safety\nmisalignment caused by imbalances in LLM training corpora. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of MCD, we manually construct multilingual versions of commonly\nused jailbreak benchmarks, such as MaliciousInstruct and AdvBench, to assess\nvarious safeguarding methods. Additionally, we introduce these datasets in\nunderrepresented (zero-shot) languages to verify the language transferability\nof MCD.

This change in perspective will lead to a\nmore realistic view of the technology, and allow for better policy decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AGI\uff09\u613f\u666f\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5e94\u4ece\u52a8\u7269\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u671f\u671b\u548c\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AGI\u524d\u666f\u65e5\u76ca\u4e34\u8fd1\uff0cAI\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u501f\u9274\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\uff09\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6765\u6539\u8fdbAGI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u52a8\u7269\u667a\u80fd\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8c03\u6574AGI\u613f\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u53d8\u5c06\u5e26\u6765\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u7684\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u653f\u7b56\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003AGI\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "keywords": ["AI\u98ce\u9669", "AI\u5b89\u5168\u6027", "\u901a\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AGI\uff09", "AI\u5bf9\u9f50", "\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd"]}}

In this work, we\nderive a linear convergence rate for training two-layer linear neural networks\nwith GD for general losses and under relaxed assumptions on the step size,\nwidth, and initialization. A key challenge in deriving this result is that\nclassical ingredients for deriving convergence rates for nonconvex problems,\nsuch as the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition and Descent Lemma, do not hold\nglobally for overparameterized neural networks. Here, we prove that these two\nconditions hold locally with local constants that depend on the weights. Then,\nwe provide bounds on these local constants, which depend on the initialization\nof the weights, the current loss, and the global PL and smoothness constants of\nthe non-overparameterized model.

Unlike, for example, contrastive methods, which\nnaturally cluster classes in the latent space, we find that an (auto)encoder\ntrained to maximize Wasserstein correlation between the input and encoded\ndistributions instead acts as a compressor, reducing dimensionality while\napproximately preserving the topological and geometric properties of the input\ndistribution. More strikingly, we show that Wasserstein correlation\nmaximization can be used to arrive at an (auto)encoder -- either trained from\nscratch, or else one that extends a frozen, pretrained model -- that is\napproximately invariant to a chosen augmentation, or collection of\naugmentations, and that still approximately preserves the structural properties\nof the non-augmented input distribution. To do this, we first define the notion\nof an augmented encoder using the machinery of Markov-Wasserstein kernels. When\nthe maximization objective is then applied to the augmented encoder, as opposed\nto the underlying, deterministic encoder, the resulting model exhibits the\ndesired invariance properties. Finally, besides our experimental results, which\nshow that even simple feedforward networks can be imbued with invariants or\ncan, alternatively, be used to impart invariants to pretrained models under\nthis training process, we additionally establish various theoretical results\nfor optimal transport-based dependence measures.

We refer to this phenomenon as parameter update sparsity\ninduced by RL. It is observed across all 7 widely used RL algorithms (e.g.,\nPPO, GRPO, DPO) and all 10 LLMs from different families in our experiments.\nThis sparsity is intrinsic and occurs without any explicit sparsity promoting\nregularizations or architectural constraints. Finetuning the subnetwork alone\nrecovers the test accuracy, and, remarkably, produces a model nearly identical\nto the one obtained via full finetuning. The subnetworks from different random\nseeds, training data, and even RL algorithms show substantially greater overlap\nthan expected by chance. Our analysis suggests that this sparsity is not due to\nupdating only a subset of layers, instead, nearly all parameter matrices\nreceive similarly sparse updates. Moreover, the updates to almost all parameter\nmatrices are nearly full-rank, suggesting RL updates a small subset of\nparameters that nevertheless span almost the full subspaces that the parameter\nmatrices can represent.

It is now routinely used for robust inference with\nheavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications.\nDespite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine\nlearning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the\nm-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.\n  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample\nquantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first\nprove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator\nthat holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance\nparameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by\nconstructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the\nassumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact\nconvergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap\napproximation error.

This can result in biased inferences, where\nplausible arguments are incorrectly deemed logically valid or vice versa.\nMitigating this limitation is critical, as it undermines the trustworthiness\nand generalizability of LLMs in applications that demand rigorous logical\nconsistency. This paper investigates the problem of mitigating content biases\non formal reasoning through activation steering. Specifically, we curate a\ncontrolled syllogistic reasoning dataset to disentangle formal validity from\ncontent plausibility. After localising the layers responsible for formal and\nmaterial inference, we investigate contrastive activation steering methods for\ntest-time interventions. An extensive empirical analysis on different LLMs\nreveals that contrastive steering consistently supports linear control over\ncontent biases. However, we observe that a static approach is insufficient for\nimproving all the tested models. We then leverage the possibility to control\ncontent effects by dynamically determining the value of the steering parameters\nvia fine-grained conditional methods. We found that conditional steering is\neffective on unresponsive models, achieving up to 15% absolute improvement in\nformal reasoning accuracy with a newly introduced kNN-based method (K-CAST).\nFinally, additional experiments reveal that steering for content effects is\nrobust to prompt variations, incurs minimal side effects on language modeling\ncapabilities, and can partially generalize to out-of-distribution reasoning\ntasks.

For developing the first perspective, we\nmake use of a cognitive computational model of the mental lexicon, the\ndiscriminative lexicon model. For computational mappings between form and\nmeaning to be productive, in the sense that novel, previously unencountered\nwords, can be understood and produced, there must be systematicities between\nthe form space and the semantic space. If the relation between form and meaning\nwould be truly arbitrary, a model could memorize form and meaning pairings, but\nthere is no way in which the model would be able to generalize to novel test\ndata. For Finnish nominal inflection, Malay derivation, and English\ncompounding, we explore, using the Discriminative Lexicon Model as a\ncomputational tool, to trace differences in the degree to which inflectional\nand word formation patterns are productive. We show that the DLM tends to\nassociate affix-like sublexical units with the centroids of the embeddings of\nthe words with a given affix. For developing the second perspective, we study\nhow the intake and output of one prolific writer, Thomas Mann, changes over\ntime. We show by means of an examination of what Thomas Mann is likely to have\nread, and what he wrote, that the rate at which Mann produces novel derived\nwords is extremely low. There are far more novel words in his input than in his\noutput. We show that Thomas Mann is less likely to produce a novel derived word\nwith a given suffix the greater the average distance is of the embeddings of\nall derived words to the corresponding centroid, and discuss the challenges of\nusing speaker-specific embeddings for low-frequency and novel words.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5386\u65f6\u89c6\u89d2\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u82ac\u5170\u8bed\u3001\u9a6c\u6765\u8bed\u548c\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\u00b7\u66fc\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u4f53\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5386\u65f6\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8bcd\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\u00b7\u66fc\u7684\u9605\u8bfb\u548c\u5199\u4f5c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2a\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u8bcd\u7f00\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\u00b7\u66fc\u7684\u65b0\u8bcd\u4ea7\u51fa\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e0e\u5f62\u5f0f-\u610f\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ea7\u51fa\u53d7\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\u3002", "keywords": ["\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u751f\u4ea7\u529b", "\u8ba4\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97", "\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8bcd\u5178\u6a21\u578b", "\u6258\u9a6c\u65af\u00b7\u66fc", "\u5386\u65f6\u7814\u7a76"]}}

The advent of large language models\n(LLMs) has greatly advanced this field by improving context understanding and\nconversational fluency. However, existing LLM-based dialogue systems often fall\nshort in proactively understanding the user's chatting preferences and guiding\nconversations toward user-centered topics. This lack of user-oriented\nproactivity can lead users to feel unappreciated, reducing their satisfaction\nand willingness to continue the conversation in human-computer interactions. To\naddress this issue, we propose a User-oriented Proactive Chatbot (UPC) to\nenhance the user-oriented proactivity. Specifically, we first construct a\ncritic to evaluate this proactivity inspired by the LLM-as-a-judge strategy.\nGiven the scarcity of high-quality training data, we then employ the critic to\nguide dialogues between the chatbot and user agents, generating a corpus with\nenhanced user-oriented proactivity.

Deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) has been widely employed for automated scheduling policy design. However,\nthe performance of DRL is heavily influenced by the design of the\nproblem-tailored policy network and is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and\nthe design of reward feedback. Considering the above-mentioned issues, this\nstudy proposes a novel DRL method combining Graph Attention Networks-based\npolicy network and Evolution Strategy, referred to as GATES. The contributions\nof GATES are summarized as follows: (1) GATES can capture the impact of current\ntask scheduling on subsequent tasks by learning the topological relationships\nbetween tasks in a DAG. (2) GATES can learn the importance of each VM to ready\ntasks, increasing the chance of selecting the optimal VM. (3) Utilizing\nEvolution Strategy's robustness, exploratory nature, and tolerance for delayed\nrewards, GATES achieves stable policy learning in CADWS. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GATES in CADWS,\noutperforming several state-of-the-art algorithms.

To address this, we introduce a fine-grained turn-level advantage\nestimation strategy to enable more precise credit assignment in multi-turn\nagent interactions. The strategy is general and can be incorporated into\nvarious RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO).\nOur experimental evaluation on multi-turn reasoning and search-based tool-use\ntasks with GRPO implementations highlights the effectiveness of the MDP\nframework and the turn-level credit assignment in advancing the multi-turn\nreasoning capabilities of LLM agents in complex decision-making settings.

However, when applied to\nlong-context scenarios, they face two challenges, i.e., low computational\nefficiency and much redundant information. This paper introduces GMSA, a\ncontext compression framework based on the encoder-decoder architecture, which\naddresses these challenges by reducing input sequence length and redundant\ninformation. Structurally, GMSA has two key components: Group Merging and Layer\nSemantic Alignment (LSA). Group merging is used to effectively and efficiently\nextract summary vectors from the original context. Layer semantic alignment, on\nthe other hand, aligns the high-level summary vectors with the low-level\nprimary input semantics, thus bridging the semantic gap between different\nlayers. In the training process, GMSA first learns soft tokens that contain\ncomplete semantics through autoencoder training. To furtherly adapt GMSA to\ndownstream tasks, we propose Knowledge Extraction Fine-tuning (KEFT) to extract\nknowledge from the soft tokens for downstream tasks.

Through the linguistic analysis of features such as\nthe frequency of LLM-preferred words, lexical complexity, syntactic complexity,\ncohesion, readability and sentiment, the results indicate a significant\nincrease in the proportion of LLM-preferred words in abstracts, revealing the\nwidespread influence of LLMs on academic writing. Additionally, we observed an\nincrease in lexical complexity and sentiment in the abstracts, but a decrease\nin syntactic complexity, suggesting that LLMs introduce more new vocabulary and\nsimplify sentence structure. However, the significant decrease in cohesion and\nreadability indicates that abstracts have fewer connecting words and are\nbecoming more difficult to read.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\npotential in FSRE through in-context learning (ICL), their general-purpose\ntraining objectives often result in suboptimal performance for task-specific\nrelation extraction. To overcome these challenges, we propose TKRE (Two-Stage\nKnowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction), a novel framework that\nsynergistically integrates LLMs with traditional relation extraction models,\nbridging generative and discriminative learning paradigms. TKRE introduces two\nkey innovations: (1) leveraging LLMs to generate explanation-driven knowledge\nand schema-constrained synthetic data, addressing the issue of data scarcity;\nand (2) a two-stage pre-training strategy combining Masked Span Language\nModeling (MSLM) and Span-Level Contrastive Learning (SCL) to enhance relational\nreasoning and generalization. Together, these components enable TKRE to\neffectively tackle FSRE tasks. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the efficacy of TKRE, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in\nFSRE and underscoring its potential for broader application in low-resource\nscenarios. \\footnote{The code and data are released on\nhttps://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/TKRE.", "AI": {"tldr": "TKRE (Two-Stage Knowledge-Guided Pre-training for Relation Extraction) \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\uff08FSRE\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u53d6\uff08FSRE\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u901a\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "TKRE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528LLMs\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08MSLM\u548cSCL\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTKRE\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TKRE\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86FSRE\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "keywords": ["Few-Shot Relation Extraction", "Large Language Models", "Pre-training", "Knowledge-Guided Learning", "Contrastive Learning"]}}

Coined in robotics, the term now applies to\nDTs, where discrepancies stem from context mismatches, cross-domain\ninteractions, and multi-scale dynamics. Among these, context mismatch is\npressing and underexplored, as DT accuracy depends on capturing operational\ncontext, often only partially observable. However, DTs have a key advantage:\nsimulators can systematically vary contextual factors and explore scenarios\ndifficult or impossible to observe empirically, informing inference and model\nalignment. While sim-to-real transfer like domain adaptation shows promise in\nrobotics, their application to DTs poses two key challenges. First, unlike\none-time policy transfers, DTs require continuous calibration across an asset's\nlifecycle--demanding structured information flow, timely detection of\nout-of-sync states, and integration of historical and new data. Second, DTs\noften perform inverse modeling, inferring latent states or faults from\nobservations that may reflect multiple evolving contexts. These needs strain\npurely data-driven models and risk violating physical consistency. Though some\napproaches preserve validity via reduced-order model, most domain adaptation\ntechniques still lack such constraints. To address this, we propose a Reality\nGap Analysis (RGA) module for DTs that continuously integrates new sensor data,\ndetects misalignments, and recalibrates DTs via a query-response framework. Our\napproach fuses domain-adversarial deep learning with reduced-order simulator\nguidance to improve context inference and preserve physical consistency.

To handle complex queries\nmore effectively, researchers developed Adaptive-RAG (A-RAG) to enhance the\ngenerated quality through multiple interactions with external knowledge bases.\nDespite its effectiveness, A-RAG exacerbates the pre-existing efficiency\nchallenges inherent in RAG, which are attributable to its reliance on multiple\niterations of generation. Existing A-RAG approaches process all retrieved\ncontents from scratch. However, they ignore the situation where there is a\nsignificant overlap in the content of the retrieval results across rounds. The\noverlapping content is redundantly represented, which leads to a large\nproportion of repeated computations, thus affecting the overall efficiency.

However, the scarcity of experimental validation data poses a\nsignificant challenge to AI-driven research paradigms. Under few-shot learning\nscenarios, the quality of molecular representations directly dictates the\ntheoretical upper limit of model performance. We present AdaptMol, a\nprototypical network integrating Adaptive multimodal fusion for Molecular\nrepresentation. This framework employs a dual-level attention mechanism to\ndynamically integrate global and local molecular features derived from two\nmodalities: SMILES sequences and molecular graphs. (1) At the local level,\nstructural features such as atomic interactions and substructures are extracted\nfrom molecular graphs, emphasizing fine-grained topological information; (2) At\nthe global level, the SMILES sequence provides a holistic representation of the\nmolecule.

While\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances reasoning, it\nindiscriminately generates lengthy reasoning steps for all queries, leading to\nsubstantial computational costs and inefficiency, especially for simpler\ninputs. To address this critical issue, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive\nChain-of-Thought), a novel framework enabling LLMs to adaptively decide when to\ninvoke CoT. AdaCoT framed adaptive reasoning as a Pareto optimization problem\nthat seeks to balance model performance with the costs associated with CoT\ninvocation (both frequency and computational overhead). We propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL) based method, specifically utilizing Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically control the CoT triggering decision\nboundary by adjusting penalty coefficients, thereby allowing the model to\ndetermine CoT necessity based on implicit query complexity. A key technical\ncontribution is Selective Loss Masking (SLM), designed to counteract decision\nboundary collapse during multi-stage RL training, ensuring robust and stable\nadaptive triggering. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaCoT successfully\nnavigates the Pareto frontier, achieving substantial reductions in CoT usage\nfor queries not requiring elaborate reasoning.

Existing methods\noften address these issues across datasets (globally) but overlook the\nimbalance and heterogeneity within individual datasets (locally), which limits\ntheir effectiveness. We introduce Hierarchical Balancing Optimization (HBO), a\nnovel method that enables LLMs to autonomously adjust data allocation during\nfine-tuning both across datasets (globally) and within each individual dataset\n(locally). HBO employs a bilevel optimization strategy with two types of\nactors: a Global Actor, which balances data sampling across different subsets\nof the training mixture, and several Local Actors, which optimizes data usage\nwithin each subset based on difficulty levels. These actors are guided by\nreward functions derived from the LLM's training state, which measure learning\nprogress and relative performance improvement.

Agent-based models (ABM) are widely used to study emergent\nphenomena arising from local interactions. However, their high computational\ncost poses a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale simulations\nrequiring extensive parameter exploration, optimization, or uncertainty\nquantification. The increasing complexity of ABM limits their feasibility for\nreal-time decision-making and large-scale scenario analysis. To address these\nlimitations, surrogate models offer an efficient alternative by learning\napproximations from sparse simulation data. These models provide\ncheap-to-evaluate predictions, significantly reducing computational costs while\nmaintaining accuracy. Various machine learning techniques, including regression\nmodels, neural networks, random forests and Gaussian processes, have been\napplied to construct robust surrogates. Moreover, uncertainty quantification\nand sensitivity analysis play a crucial role in enhancing model reliability and\ninterpretability.\n  This article explores the motivations, methods, and applications of surrogate\nmodeling for ABM, emphasizing the trade-offs between accuracy, computational\nefficiency, and interpretability. Through a case study on a segregation model,\nwe highlight the challenges associated with building and validating surrogate\nmodels, comparing different approaches and evaluating their performance.\nFinally, we discuss future perspectives on integrating surrogate models within\nABM to improve scalability, explainability, and real-time decision support\nacross various fields such as ecology, urban planning and economics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ABM\uff09\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3ABM\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66ff\u4ee3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aABM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "keywords": ["\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b", "\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21", "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60", "ABM", "\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387"]}}

Specifically, we propose WikiDYK,\nwhich leverages recently-added and human-written facts from Wikipedia's \"Did\nYou Know...\" entries. These entries are carefully selected by expert Wikipedia\neditors based on criteria such as verifiability and clarity. Each entry is\nconverted into multiple question-answer pairs spanning diverse task formats\nfrom easy cloze prompts to complex multi-hop questions. WikiDYK contains 12,290\nfacts and 77,180 questions, which is also seamlessly extensible with future\nupdates from Wikipedia editors. Extensive experiments using continued\npre-training reveal a surprising insight: despite their prevalence in modern\nLLMs, Causal Language Models (CLMs) demonstrate significantly weaker knowledge\nmemorization capabilities compared to Bidirectional Language Models (BiLMs),\nexhibiting a 23% lower accuracy in terms of reliability. To compensate for the\nsmaller scales of current BiLMs, we introduce a modular collaborative framework\nutilizing ensembles of BiLMs as external knowledge repositories to integrate\nwith LLMs. Experiment shows that our framework further improves the reliability\naccuracy by up to 29.1%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86WikiDYK\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eWikipedia\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\u800c\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWikiDYK\uff0c\u5229\u7528Wikipedia\u7684\u201cDid You Know...\u201d\u6761\u76ee\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CLMs\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u80fd\u529b\u6bd4\u53cc\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08BiLMs\uff09\u5f3123%\uff1b\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e8629.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "WikiDYK\u4e3aLLMs\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86CLMs\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "keywords": ["\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6", "\u53cc\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6", "WikiDYK"]}}

Bayesian Optimization (BO)\nprovides an effective framework for such problems. However, traditional BO\nmethods are prone to get trapped in local optima and often lack interpretable\ninsights. To address this issue, this paper designs Reasoning BO, a novel\nframework that leverages reasoning models to guide the sampling process in BO\nwhile incorporating multi-agent systems and knowledge graphs for online\nknowledge accumulation. By integrating the reasoning and contextual\nunderstanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we can provide\nstrong guidance to enhance the BO process. As the optimization progresses,\nReasoning BO provides real-time sampling recommendations along with critical\ninsights grounded in plausible scientific theories, aiding in the discovery of\nsuperior solutions within the search space. We systematically evaluate our\napproach across 10 diverse tasks encompassing synthetic mathematical functions\nand complex real-world applications. The framework demonstrates its capability\nto progressively refine sampling strategies through real-time insights and\nhypothesis evolution, effectively identifying higher-performing regions of the\nsearch space for focused exploration. This process highlights the powerful\nreasoning and context-learning abilities of LLMs in optimization scenarios.

As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well\nunderstood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple\narchitectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to\nanalyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial\n(graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper,\nwe initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by\nconnecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive\npower of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are\ncombined.

In this paper, we\nidentify two distinct goals of loss reweighting, namely, Saturation and\nImportance -- the former indicates that those insufficiently optimized data\nshould be emphasized, while the latter stresses some critical data that are\nmost influential for loss minimization. To study their usefulness, we design\nspecific reweighting strategies for each goal and evaluate their respective\neffects on unlearning. We conduct extensive empirical analyses on\nwell-established benchmarks, and summarize some important observations as\nfollows: (i) Saturation enhances efficacy more than importance-based\nreweighting, and their combination can yield additional improvements. (ii)\nSaturation typically allocates lower weights to data with lower likelihoods,\nwhereas importance-based reweighting does the opposite. (iii) The efficacy of\nunlearning is also largely influenced by the smoothness and granularity of the\nweight distributions. Based on these findings, we propose SatImp, a simple\nreweighting method that combines the advantages of both saturation and\nimportance.

However, alongside these successes, a more\ndeceptive form of model error has emerged--Reasoning Hallucination--where\nlogically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive\nyet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are\nembedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and\npotentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations\nfrom a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which\nquantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits\nobtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space,\neffectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep\nreasoning.

Quantization, a\npowerful training optimization technique, has been widely explored for\nintegration into FL. However, many studies fail to consider the distinct\nperformance attribution between particular quantization strategies, such as\npost-training quantization (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT). As a\nresult, existing FL quantization methods rely solely on either PTQ or QAT,\noptimizing for speed or accuracy while compromising the other. To efficiently\naccelerate FL and maintain distributed convergence accuracy across various FL\nsettings, this paper proposes a hybrid quantitation approach combining PTQ and\nQAT for FL systems. We conduct case studies to validate the effectiveness of\nusing hybrid quantization in FL. To solve the difficulty of modeling speed and\naccuracy caused by device and data heterogeneity, we propose a hardware-related\nanalysis and data-distribution-related analysis to help identify the trade-off\nboundaries for strategy selection.

The primary idea is to use a lightweight draft model to speculate the\noutput of the target model for multiple subsequent timesteps, and then verify\nthem in parallel to determine whether the drafted tokens should be accepted or\nrejected. To enhance acceptance rates, existing frameworks typically construct\ntoken trees containing multiple candidates in each timestep. However, their\nreliance on token-level verification mechanisms introduces two critical\nlimitations: First, the probability distribution of a sequence differs from\nthat of individual tokens, leading to suboptimal acceptance length. Second,\ncurrent verification schemes begin from the root node and proceed layer by\nlayer in a top-down manner. Once a parent node is rejected, all its child nodes\nshould be discarded, resulting in inefficient utilization of speculative\ncandidates. This paper introduces Traversal Verification, a novel speculative\ndecoding algorithm that fundamentally rethinks the verification paradigm\nthrough leaf-to-root traversal. Our approach considers the acceptance of the\nentire token sequence from the current node to the root, and preserves\npotentially valid subsequences that would be prematurely discarded by existing\nmethods. We theoretically prove that the probability distribution obtained\nthrough Traversal Verification is identical to that of the target model,\nguaranteeing lossless inference while achieving substantial acceleration gains.\nExperimental results across different large language models and multiple tasks\nshow that our method consistently improves acceptance length and throughput\nover existing methods", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'Traversal Verification'\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u53f6\u5b50\u5230\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6539\u8fdb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86token\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709token\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9010\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a5\u53d7\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u4e14\u5019\u9009token\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Traversal Verification\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ece\u53f6\u5b50\u5230\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u904d\u5386\u65b9\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1token\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a5\u53d7\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Traversal Verification\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u65e0\u635f\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u3002", "keywords": ["speculative decoding", "large language models", "traversal verification", "acceleration", "token trees"]}}

Similarly, graph foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a promising\ndirection in graph learning, aiming to generalize across diverse datasets\nthrough large-scale pre-training. However, unlike language models that rely on\nexplicit token representations, graphs lack a well-defined unit for\ngeneralization, making it challenging to design effective pre-training\nstrategies. In this work, we propose REEF, a novel framework that leverages\nrelation tokens as the basic units for GFMs. Inspired by the token vocabulary\nin LLMs, we construct a relation vocabulary of relation tokens to store\nrelational information within graphs. To accommodate diverse relations, we\nintroduce two hypernetworks that adaptively generate the parameters of\naggregators and classifiers in graph neural networks based on relation tokens.\nIn addition, we design another hypernetwork to construct dataset-specific\nprojectors and incorporate a dataset-level feature bias into the initial node\nrepresentations, enhancing flexibility across different datasets with the same\nrelation. Further, we adopt graph data augmentation and a mixed-dataset\npre-training strategy, allowing REEF to capture relational diversity more\neffectively and exhibit strong generalization capabilities.

We propose self-questioning as\na lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding,\nparticularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic\ndistinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new\nbenchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized\nby dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark\ncenters on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between\nclosely related but substantively different inventions? We show that prompting\nLLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background\nknowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These\nself-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal\nknowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts\nfurther enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and\nlacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that\nchain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though\nself-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of\ntechnical concepts.

We propose the Structure-Guided Cross-Modal\nAlignment (SGCMA), a framework that fully exploits and aligns the\nstate-transition graph structures shared by time-series and linguistic data as\nsequential modalities, thereby endowing time series with language-like\nproperties and delivering stronger generalization after modality alignment.\nSGCMA consists of two key components, namely Structure Alignment and Semantic\nAlignment. In Structure Alignment, a state transition matrix is learned from\ntext data through Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and a shallow transformer-based\nMaximum Entropy Markov Model (MEMM) receives the hot-start transition matrix\nand annotates each temporal patch into state probability, ensuring that the\ntemporal representation sequence inherits language-like sequential dynamics. In\nSemantic Alignment, cross-attention is applied between temporal patches and the\ntop-k tokens within each state, and the ultimate temporal embeddings are\nderived by the expected value of these embeddings using a weighted average\nbased on state probabilities.

We find symbolic planning to\noutperform direct VLM planning in Blocksworld, where accurate image grounding\nis crucial, whereas the opposite is true in the household robotics tasks, where\ncommonsense knowledge and the ability to recover from errors are beneficial.\nFinally, we show that across most models and methods, there is no significant\nbenefit to using Chain-of-Thought prompting, suggesting that current VLMs still\nstruggle with visual reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViPlan\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9VLM\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6bd4\u8f83\u73af\u5883\uff0cViPlan\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "ViPlan\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u7248\u7684Blocksworld\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u5bb6\u5ead\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e5d\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90VLM\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u90e8\u5206\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Blocksworld\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u5bb6\u5ead\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e14Chain-of-Thought\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "keywords": ["ViPlan", "\u89c6\u89c9\u89c4\u5212", "\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212", "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "Blocksworld", "\u5bb6\u5ead\u673a\u5668\u4eba"]}}

Beyond canonical\nattention, attention with bias also widely exists, such as relative position\nbias in vision and language models and pair representation bias in AlphaFold.\nIn these works, prior knowledge is introduced as an additive bias term of\nattention weights to guide the learning process, which has been proven\nessential for model performance. Surprisingly, despite the common usage of\nattention with bias, its targeted efficiency optimization is still absent,\nwhich seriously hinders its wide applications in complex tasks. Diving into the\ncomputation of FlashAttention, we prove that its optimal efficiency is\ndetermined by the rank of the attention weight matrix. Inspired by this\ntheoretical result, this paper presents FlashBias based on the low-rank\ncompressed sensing theory, which can provide fast-exact computation for many\nwidely used attention biases and a fast-accurate approximation for biases in\ngeneral formalization. FlashBias can fully take advantage of the extremely\noptimized matrix multiplication operation in modern GPUs, achieving 1.5$\\times$\nspeedup for AlphaFold, and over 2$\\times$ speedup for attention with bias in\nvision and language models without loss of accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashBias\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u5316\u5e26\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5e26\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u4e13\u95e8\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eFlashAttention\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7531\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u79e9\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFlashBias\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u5728AlphaFold\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.5\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashBias\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e26\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": ["\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236", "\u5e26\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b", "\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316", "\u4f4e\u79e9\u538b\u7f29", "FlashBias"]}}

Although numerous detection methods have been developed to\ndifferentiate between machine-generated texts (MGT) and human-generated texts\n(HGT), the explainability of these methods remains a significant gap.\nTraditional explainability techniques often fall short in capturing the complex\nword relationships that distinguish HGT from MGT. To address this limitation,\nwe present LM$^2$otifs, a novel explainable framework for MGT detection.\nInspired by probabilistic graphical models, we provide a theoretical rationale\nfor the effectiveness. LM$^2$otifs utilizes eXplainable Graph Neural Networks\nto achieve both accurate detection and interpretability. The LM$^2$otifs\npipeline operates in three key stages: first, it transforms text into graphs\nbased on word co-occurrence to represent lexical dependencies; second, graph\nneural networks are used for prediction; and third, a post-hoc explainability\nmethod extracts interpretable motifs, offering multi-level explanations from\nindividual words to sentence structures.

However, the obtained\nrobustness can easily be deteriorated when these models are fine-tuned on other\ndownstream tasks (e.g., of smaller scales). Previous works often interpret this\nphenomenon in the context of domain shift, developing fine-tuning methods that\naim to preserve the original domain as much as possible. However, in a\ndifferent context, fine-tuned models with limited data are also prone to\nlearning features that are spurious to humans, such as background or texture.\nIn this paper, we propose StarFT (Spurious Textual Alignment Regularization), a\nnovel framework for fine-tuning zero-shot models to enhance robustness by\npreventing them from learning spuriosity. We introduce a regularization that\naligns the output distribution for spuriosity-injected labels with the original\nzero-shot model, ensuring that the model is not induced to extract irrelevant\nfeatures further from these descriptions.We leverage recent language models to\nget such spuriosity-injected labels by generating alternative textual\ndescriptions that highlight potentially confounding features.Extensive\nexperiments validate the robust generalization of StarFT and its emerging\nproperties: zero-shot group robustness and improved zero-shot classification.\nNotably, StarFT boosts both worst-group and average accuracy by 14.30% and\n3.02%, respectively, in the Waterbirds group shift scenario, where other robust\nfine-tuning baselines show even degraded performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "StarFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9632\u6b62\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u5b66\u4e60\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStarFT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5c06\u865a\u5047\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waterbirds\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cStarFT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u7ec4\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8fbe14.30%\u548c3.02%\u3002", "conclusion": "StarFT\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "keywords": ["\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6a21\u578b", "\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81", "\u5fae\u8c03", "StarFT"]}}

By providing a comprehensive review\nof existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this\nsurvey aims to bridge the gap between bandit algorithms and LLMs, paving the\nway for innovative applications and interdisciplinary research in AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e24\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347AI\u9886\u57df\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8AI\u521b\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\u3002", "keywords": ["\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5", "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b", "\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316", "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406", "\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76"]}}

Under review in Nature portfolio", "summary": "Predicting crash events is crucial for understanding crash distributions and\ntheir contributing factors, thereby enabling the design of proactive traffic\nsafety policy interventions. However, existing methods struggle to interpret\nthe complex interplay among various sources of traffic crash data, including\nnumeric characteristics, textual reports, crash imagery, environmental\nconditions, and driver behavior records. As a result, they often fail to\ncapture the rich semantic information and intricate interrelationships embedded\nin these diverse data sources, limiting their ability to identify critical\ncrash risk factors. In this research, we propose TrafficSafe, a framework that\nadapts LLMs to reframe crash prediction and feature attribution as text-based\nreasoning. A multi-modal crash dataset including 58,903 real-world reports\ntogether with belonged infrastructure, environmental, driver, and vehicle\ninformation is collected and textualized into TrafficSafe Event Dataset. By\ncustomizing and fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset, the TrafficSafe LLM achieves\na 42% average improvement in F1-score over baselines. To interpret these\npredictions and uncover contributing factors, we introduce TrafficSafe\nAttribution, a sentence-level feature attribution framework enabling\nconditional risk analysis. Findings show that alcohol-impaired driving is the\nleading factor in severe crashes, with aggressive and impairment-related\nbehaviors having nearly twice the contribution for severe crashes compared to\nother driver behaviors. Furthermore, TrafficSafe Attribution highlights pivotal\nfeatures during model training, guiding strategic crash data collection for\niterative performance improvements.

However, while theoretical\nanalyses have explored this prediction capability, the nature of the inferred\ncontext and its utility for downstream predictions remain open questions. This\npaper aims to address these questions by examining ICL for inverse linear\nregression (ILR), where context inference can be characterized by unsupervised\nlearning of underlying weight vectors. Focusing on the challenging scenario of\nrank-deficient inverse problems, where context length is smaller than the\nnumber of unknowns in the weight vectors and regularization is necessary, we\nintroduce a linear transformer to learn the inverse mapping from contextual\nexamples to the underlying weight vector. Our findings reveal that the\ntransformer implicitly learns both a prior distribution and an effective\nregularization strategy, outperforming traditional ridge regression and\nregularization methods. A key insight is the necessity of low task\ndimensionality relative to the context length for successful learning.\nFurthermore, we numerically verify that the error of the transformer estimator\nscales linearly with the noise level, the ratio of task dimension to context\nlength, and the condition number of the input data.

Despite\nrecent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific\ndiscovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single\nworkflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of\nfully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By\nintegrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can\ngenerate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and\ngenerate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific\ndiscovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment\nfor dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness\nin the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium\nphagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a\npromising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho\nkinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating\ndAMD.

The challenge of S-CBVR task is\nhow to achieve high temporal alignment accuracy with efficient computation and\nlow storage consumption. In this paper, we propose a Segment Similarity and\nAlignment Network (SSAN) in dealing with the challenge which is firstly trained\nend-to-end in S-CBVR. SSAN is based on two newly proposed modules in video\nretrieval: (1) An efficient Self-supervised Keyframe Extraction (SKE) module to\nreduce redundant frame features, (2) A robust Similarity Pattern Detection\n(SPD) module for temporal alignment. In comparison with uniform frame\nextraction, SKE not only saves feature storage and search time, but also\nintroduces comparable accuracy and limited extra computation time. In terms of\ntemporal alignment, SPD localizes similar segments with higher accuracy and\nefficiency than existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, we jointly train\nSSAN with SKE and SPD and achieve an end-to-end improvement. Meanwhile, the two\nkey modules SKE and SPD can also be effectively inserted into other video\nretrieval pipelines and gain considerable performance improvements.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that SSAN can obtain higher\nalignment accuracy while saving storage and online query computational cost\ncompared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSSAN\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u9891\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\uff08CBVR\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7CBVR\uff08S-CBVR\uff09\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SSAN\u7f51\u7edc\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6\uff08SKE\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u5e27\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08SPD\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSSAN\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "SSAN\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5176\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757SKE\u548cSPD\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "keywords": ["\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22", "\u7247\u6bb5\u7ea7CBVR", "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60", "\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6", "\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50"]}}

Early detection\nof PD remains particularly challenging in resource-constrained settings, where\nvoice-based analysis has emerged as a promising non-invasive and cost-effective\nalternative. However, existing studies predominantly focus on English or other\nmajor languages; notably, no voice dataset for PD exists for Bengali - posing a\nsignificant barrier to culturally inclusive and accessible healthcare\nsolutions.

Currently, manual extraction of behavioral indicators from\ndense forensic documentation causes significant attribution delays, especially\nfollowing major incidents at the international scale. This research evaluates\nlarge language models (LLMs) for cyber-attack attribution based on behavioral\nindicators extracted from forensic documentation. We test OpenAI's GPT-4 and\ntext-embedding-3-large for identifying threat actors' tactics, techniques, and\nprocedures (TTPs) by comparing LLM-generated TTPs against human-generated data\nfrom MITRE ATT&CK Groups. Our framework then identifies TTPs from text using\nvector embedding search and builds profiles to attribute new attacks for a\nmachine learning model to learn. Key contributions include: (1) assessing\noff-the-shelf LLMs for TTP extraction and attribution, and (2) developing an\nend-to-end pipeline from raw CTI documents to threat-actor prediction.

To meet privacy and security requirements, Continual Unlearning\n(CU) emerges as an important problem, aiming to sequentially forget particular\nknowledge acquired during the CL phase. However, existing unlearning methods\nprimarily focus on single-shot joint forgetting and face significant\nlimitations when applied to CU. First, most existing methods require access to\nthe retained dataset for re-training or fine-tuning, violating the inherent\nconstraint in CL that historical data cannot be revisited. Second, these\nmethods often suffer from a poor trade-off between system efficiency and model\nfidelity, making them vulnerable to being overwhelmed or degraded by\nadversaries through deliberately frequent requests. In this paper, we identify\nthat the limitations of existing unlearning methods stem fundamentally from\ntheir reliance on gradient-based updates.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Low-Rank Clone (LRC), an efficient\npre-training method that constructs SLMs aspiring to behavioral equivalence\nwith strong teacher models.

This paper investigates the effects of\nexplicit input text structure and prompt engineering on the performance of\nGPT-4o and GPT-4.1 on a legal question-answering task using an excerpt of the\nCUAD. We compare model exact-match accuracy across various input formats:\nwell-structured plain-text (human-generated from CUAD), plain-text cleaned of\nline breaks, extracted plain-text from Azure OCR, plain-text extracted by\nGPT-4o Vision, and extracted (and interpreted) Markdown (MD) from GPT-4o\nVision. To give an indication of the impact of possible prompt engineering, we\nassess the impact of shifting task instructions to the system prompt and\nexplicitly informing the model about the structured nature of the input. Our\nfindings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates considerable robustness to variations\nin input structure, but lacks in overall performance. Conversely, GPT-4.1's\nperformance is markedly sensitive; poorly structured inputs yield suboptimal\nresults (but identical with GPT-4o), while well-structured formats (original\nCUAD text, GPT-4o Vision text and GPT-4o MD) improve exact-match accuracy by\n~20 percentage points. Optimizing the system prompt to include task details and\nan advisory about structured input further elevates GPT-4.1's accuracy by an\nadditional ~10-13 percentage points, with Markdown ultimately achieving the\nhighest performance under these conditions (79 percentage points overall\nexact-match accuracy).

Human conducts System 2 reasoning via\nthe language of thoughts that organizes the reasoning process as a causal\nsequence of mental language, or thoughts. Recently, it has been observed that\nSystem 2 reasoning can be elicited from Large Language Models (LLMs)\npre-trained on large-scale natural languages. However, in this work, we show\nthat there is a significant gap between the modeling of languages and thoughts.\nAs language is primarily a tool for humans to share knowledge and thinking,\nmodeling human language can easily absorb language biases into LLMs deviated\nfrom the chain of thoughts in minds. Furthermore, we show that the biases will\nmislead the eliciting of \"thoughts\" in LLMs to focus only on a biased part of\nthe premise.

In this work, we analyze the\nGRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation\nof question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO\nand traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by\nthese insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization\n(DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of\ndiscriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its\nrecent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a\ndiscriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons\nclipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used\nas scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained\noptimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable\ntraining. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its\nvariants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting\ndiscriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO\nand its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a\nconstrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of\nadvanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a\nsignificant number of questions have more negative than positive generated\nanswers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical\nreasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly\noutperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average\ngains of 7\\% over GRPO and 6\\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B\nmodel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5224\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DisCO\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "DisCO\u91c7\u7528\u5224\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u4ee3GRPO\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7ec4\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u526a\u88c1\u7684RL\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fddKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDisCO\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u53d8\u4f53DAPO\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477%\u548c6%\u3002", "conclusion": "DisCO\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5224\u522b\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u96be\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u71b5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u573a\u666f\u3002", "keywords": ["\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60", "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b", "GRPO", "\u5224\u522b\u5b66\u4e60", "\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316"]}}

To mitigate this interference, we\npropose two novel methods: Advantage Reweighting and Low-Probability Token\nIsolation (Lopti), both of which effectively attenuate gradients from\nlow-probability tokens while emphasizing parameter updates driven by\nhigh-probability tokens. Our approaches promote balanced updates across tokens\nwith varying probabilities, thereby enhancing the efficiency of RL training.\nExperimental results demonstrate that they substantially improve the\nperformance of GRPO-trained LLMs, achieving up to a 46.2% improvement in K&K\nLogic Puzzle reasoning tasks.

Residual\nQuantization (RQ) is widely used to generate discrete, multitoken\nrepresentations for such data by iteratively quantizing residuals in a\nmultilevel codebook. However, its reliance on Euclidean geometry can introduce\nfundamental mismatches that hinder modeling of hierarchical branching,\nnecessary for faithful representation of hierarchical data. In this work, we\npropose Hyperbolic Residual Quantization (HRQ), which embeds data natively in a\nhyperbolic manifold and performs residual quantization using hyperbolic\noperations and distance metrics. By adapting the embedding network, residual\ncomputation, and distance metric to hyperbolic geometry, HRQ imparts an\ninductive bias that aligns naturally with hierarchical branching. We claim that\nHRQ in comparison to RQ can generate more useful for downstream tasks discrete\nhierarchical representations for data with latent hierarchies. We evaluate HRQ\non two tasks: supervised hierarchy modeling using WordNet hypernym trees, where\nthe model is supervised to learn the latent hierarchy - and hierarchy\ndiscovery, where, while latent hierarchy exists in the data, the model is not\ndirectly trained or evaluated on a task related to the hierarchy. Across both\nscenarios, HRQ hierarchical tokens yield better performance on downstream tasks\ncompared to Euclidean RQ with gains of up to $20\\%$ for the hierarchy modeling\ntask.

This work presents a\nsystematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first\nreorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The\nreorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six\nlanguages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark\n18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned\ntraditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our\nexperiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with\nfine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can\nsignificantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs\n(including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs'\ngeneral task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation,\nLLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might\nintensify the issue.

However, the specific challenges of\nadapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain relatively unexplored. In\nthis work, we present Observe-R1, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We draw\ninspirations from human learning progression--from simple to complex and easy\nto difficult, and propose a gradual learning paradigm for MLLMs. To this end,\nwe construct the NeuraLadder dataset, which is organized and sampled according\nto the difficulty and complexity of data samples for RL training. To tackle\nmultimodal tasks, we introduce a multimodal format constraint that encourages\ncareful observation of images, resulting in enhanced visual abilities and\nclearer and more structured responses. Additionally, we implement a bonus\nreward system that favors concise, correct answers within a length constraint,\nalongside a dynamic weighting mechanism that prioritizes uncertain and\nmedium-difficulty problems, ensuring that more informative samples have a\ngreater impact on training.

However, it often suffers\nfrom sub-optimal performance compared with full fine-tuning since the update is\nconstrained in the low-rank space. Recent variants such as LoRA-Pro attempt to\nmitigate this by adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices to\napproximate the full gradient. However, LoRA-Pro's solution is not unique, and\ndifferent solutions can lead to significantly varying performance in ablation\nstudies. Besides, to incorporate momentum or adaptive optimization design,\napproaches like LoRA-Pro must first compute the equivalent gradient, causing a\nhigher memory cost close to full fine-tuning. A key challenge remains in\nintegrating momentum properly into the low-rank space with lower memory cost.\nIn this work, we propose AltLoRA, an alternating projection method that avoids\nthe difficulties in gradient approximation brought by the joint update design,\nmeanwhile integrating momentum without higher memory complexity. Our\ntheoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees and further shows that\nAltLoRA enables stable feature learning and robustness to transformation\ninvariance.

However, the predominant quantile binning strategy-designed\nto distribute data points evenly among bins-may overlook critical boundary\nvalues that could enhance predictive performance. In this work, we propose\nreplacing quantile binning with a k-means discretizer initialized with quantile\nbins. We test this swap on 33 OpenML tasks plus synthetics that control for\nmodality, skew, and bin budget. Across 18 regression datasets, k-means shows no\nstatistically significant losses at the 5% level and wins in four cases-most\nstrikingly a 55% MSE drop on one particularly skewed dataset-even though\nk-means' mean reciprocal rank (MRR) is slightly lower (0.65 vs 0.72). On the 15\nclassification datasets the two methods are statistically tied (MRR 0.70 vs\n0.68) with gaps $\\leq$0.2 pp. Synthetic experiments confirm consistently large\nMSE gains-typically >20% and rising to 90% as outlier magnitude increases or\nbin budget drops. We find that k-means keeps error on par with exact splitting\nwhen extra cuts add little value, yet still recovers key split points that\nquantile overlooks. As such, we advocate for a built-in bin_method=k-means\nflag, especially in regression tasks and in tight-budget settings such as the\n32-64-bin GPU regime-because it is a \"safe default\" with large upside, yet adds\nonly a one-off, cacheable overhead ($\\approx$ 2s to bin 10M rows on one core).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528k-means\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u7bb1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u7bb1\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u5173\u952e\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7k-means\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5k-means\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u7bb1\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "k-means\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u7bb1\u7edf\u8ba1\u6301\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e2d\u5185\u7f6ek-means\u5206\u7bb1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u4f4e\u9884\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u9879\u3002", "keywords": ["\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u6811", "k-means\u79bb\u6563\u5316", "\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u7bb1", "\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1", "\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1"]}}

To address\nthese issues, we first build a realistic MM environment with random delays of\n30-100 milliseconds for order placement and market information reception, and\nimplement a batch matching mechanism that collects orders within every 500\nmilliseconds before matching them all at once, simulating the batch auction\nmechanisms adopted by some exchanges. Then, we propose Relaver, an RL-based\nmethod for MM to tackle the latency and inventory risk issues. The three main\ncontributions of Relaver are: i) we introduce an augmented state-action space\nthat incorporates order hold time alongside price and volume, enabling Relaver\nto optimize execution strategies under latency constraints and time-priority\nmatching mechanisms, ii) we leverage dynamic programming (DP) to guide the\nexploration of RL training for better policies, iii) we train a market trend\npredictor, which can guide the agent to intelligently adjust the inventory to\nreduce the risk.

Contemporary state-of-the-art sparse compressors, such\nas Top-$k$, exhibit high computational complexity, up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(d\\log_2{k})$, where $d$ is the number of model parameters. The\nhard-threshold compressor, which simply transmits elements with absolute values\nhigher than a fixed threshold, is thus proposed to reduce the complexity to\n$\\mathcal{O}(d)$. However, the hard-threshold compression causes accuracy\ndegradation in FL, where the datasets are non-IID and the stepsize $\\gamma$ is\ndecreasing for model convergence. The decaying stepsize reduces the updates and\ncauses the compression ratio of the hard-threshold compression to drop rapidly\nto an aggressive ratio. At or below this ratio, the model accuracy has been\nobserved to degrade severely. To address this, we propose $\\gamma$-FedHT, a\nstepsize-aware low-cost compressor with Error-Feedback to guarantee\nconvergence.

Current approaches often sidestep the problem by relying on invariant\nrepresentations such as point clouds and depth, or by brute-forcing\ngeneralization through visual domain randomization and/or large, visually\ndiverse datasets. Disentangled representation learning - especially when\ncombined with principles of associative memory - has recently shown promise in\nenabling vision-based reinforcement learning policies to be robust to visual\ndistribution shifts. However, these techniques have largely been constrained to\nsimpler benchmarks and toy environments. In this work, we scale disentangled\nrepresentation learning and associative memory to more visually and dynamically\ncomplex manipulation tasks and demonstrate zero-shot adaptability to visual\nperturbations in both simulation and on real hardware. We further extend this\napproach to imitation learning, specifically Diffusion Policy, and empirically\nshow significant gains in visual generalization compared to state-of-the-art\nimitation learning methods. Finally, we introduce a novel technique adapted\nfrom the model equivariance literature that transforms any trained neural\nnetwork policy into one invariant to 2D planar rotations, making our policy not\nonly visually robust but also resilient to certain camera perturbations. We\nbelieve that this work marks a significant step towards manipulation policies\nthat are not only adaptable out of the box, but also robust to the complexities\nand dynamical nature of real-world deployment.

We\nhypothesized that InnateCoder's way of learning and using options could improve\nthe sampling efficiency of current methods for learning programmatic policies.\nEmpirical results in MicroRTS and Karel the Robot support our hypothesis, since\nthey show that InnateCoder is more sample efficient than versions of the system\nthat do not use options or learn them from experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "InnateCoder\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u2018\u5148\u5929\u6280\u80fd\u2019\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f13\u6162\u3002InnateCoder\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5feb\u901f\u83b7\u5f97\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "InnateCoder\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u2018\u5148\u5929\u6280\u80fd\u2019\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u9879\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7ec4\u5408\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728MicroRTS\u548cKarel the Robot\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cInnateCoder\u6bd4\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u9009\u9879\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u9879\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "InnateCoder\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "keywords": ["\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60", "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b", "\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u7b56\u7565", "\u9009\u9879\u5b66\u4e60", "\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387"]}}

Across all three DeFaBel variants, these\ncues show negligible, statistically insignificant correlations with deception\nlabels, contrary to prior work that treats such cues as reliable indicators. We\nfurther benchmark against other English deception datasets following similar\ndata collection protocols. While some show statistically significant\ncorrelations, effect sizes remain low and, critically, the set of predictive\ncues is inconsistent across datasets. We also evaluate deception detection\nusing feature-based models, pretrained language models, and instruction-tuned\nlarge language models. While some models perform well on established deception\ndatasets, they consistently perform near chance on DeFaBel. Our findings\nchallenge the assumption that deception can be reliably inferred from\nlinguistic cues and call for rethinking how deception is studied and modeled in\nNLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b3a\u9a97\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8d28\u7591\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73b0\u6709\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u7531\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u75d5\u8ff9\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6b3a\u9a97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6DeFaBel\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e38\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5e38\u7528\u6b3a\u9a97\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5fae\u5f31\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728DeFaBel\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b3a\u9a97\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003NLP\u4e2d\u6b3a\u9a97\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "keywords": ["\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b", "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406", "\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6", "\u6570\u636e\u96c6", "\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22"]}}

We\nthereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key\nfindings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short\nprefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization\ndecreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp\ndecline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of\nthe context window.

This study introduces a novel approach\nleveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather\nforecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe\nweather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense\nneural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete\nforecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential\n``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships\nwithin the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against\npost-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional\ndense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that\nexclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the\nPangu-Weather AI model.

Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to enable model\ngeneralization across evolving domains, yet existing approaches typically\nassume smooth incremental changes, struggling with complex real-world drifts\ninvolving long-term structure (incremental evolution/periodicity) and local\nuncertainties. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FreKoo, which\ntackles these challenges via a novel frequency-domain analysis of parameter\ntrajectories. It leverages the Fourier transform to disentangle parameter\nevolution into distinct spectral bands. Specifically, low-frequency component\nwith dominant dynamics are learned and extrapolated using the Koopman operator,\nrobustly capturing diverse drift patterns including both incremental and\nperiodicity.

While recent methods rely on complex\nlearned routing strategies, their dependence on disparate training data and\nevaluation setups makes comparison and generalization difficult. In this work,\nwe revisit LLM routing through the lens of simplicity. We show that a\nwell-tuned k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) approach not only matches but often\noutperforms state-of-the-art learned routers across diverse tasks. To support\nsystematic evaluation, we introduce a suite of standardized routing benchmarks\nspanning instruction-following, question-answering, and reasoning tasks, as\nwell as the first multi-modal routing dataset involving visual inputs.

While often effective, ``reward hacking'' can lead\nto the shaping reward being optimized at the expense of the extrinsic reward,\nresulting in a suboptimal policy. Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS)\ntechniques such as Generalized Reward Matching (GRM) and Policy-Invariant\nExplicit Shaping (PIES) have mitigated this. These methods allow for\nimplementing IM without altering optimal policies. In this work we show that\nthey are effectively unsuitable for complex, exploration-heavy environments\nwith long-duration episodes. To remedy this, we introduce Action-Dependent\nOptimality Preserving Shaping (ADOPS), a method of converting intrinsic rewards\nto an optimality-preserving form that allows agents to utilize IM more\neffectively in the extremely sparse environment of Montezuma's Revenge. We also\nprove ADOPS accommodates reward shaping functions that cannot be written in a\npotential-based form: while PBRS-based methods require the cumulative\ndiscounted intrinsic return be independent of actions, ADOPS allows for\nintrinsic cumulative returns to be dependent on agents' actions while still\npreserving the optimal policy set.

In\nhumans, visual content is known to boost credibility and shareability of\ninformation, yet its effect on vision-language models (VLMs) remains unclear.\nWe present the first study examining how images influence VLMs' propensity to\nreshare news content, whether this effect varies across model families, and how\npersona conditioning and content attributes modulate this behavior. To support\nthis analysis, we introduce two methodological contributions: a\njailbreaking-inspired prompting strategy that elicits resharing decisions from\nVLMs while simulating users with antisocial traits and political alignments;\nand a multimodal dataset of fact-checked political news from PolitiFact, paired\nwith corresponding images and ground-truth veracity labels. Experiments across\nmodel families reveal that image presence increases resharing rates by 4.8% for\ntrue news and 15.0% for false news. Persona conditioning further modulates this\neffect: Dark Triad traits amplify resharing of false news, whereas\nRepublican-aligned profiles exhibit reduced veracity sensitivity. Of all the\ntested models, only Claude-3-Haiku demonstrates robustness to visual\nmisinformation.

However, two primary challenges remain for real-world applications:\n(1) the lack of quantitative metrics and actionable guidelines for evaluating\nand optimizing measurable boundaries of CoT capability, and (2) the absence of\nmethods to assess boundaries of unmeasurable CoT capability, such as multimodal\nperception. To address these gaps, we introduce the Reasoning Boundary\nFramework++ (RBF++). To tackle the first challenge, we define the reasoning\nboundary (RB) as the maximum limit of CoT performance. We also propose a\ncombination law for RBs, enabling quantitative analysis and offering actionable\nguidance across various CoT tasks. For the second challenge, particularly in\nmultimodal scenarios, we introduce a constant assumption, which replaces\nunmeasurable RBs with scenario-specific constants. Additionally, we propose the\nreasoning boundary division mechanism, which divides unmeasurable RBs into two\nsub-boundaries, facilitating the quantification and optimization of both\nunmeasurable domain knowledge and multimodal perception capabilities.

Existing unlearning efforts typically\nfine-tune the model with resources such as forget data, retain data, and a\ncalibration model. These additional gradient steps blur the decision boundary\nbetween forget and retain knowledge, making unlearning often at the expense of\noverall performance. To avoid the negative impact of fine-tuning, it would be\nbetter to unlearn solely at inference time by safely guarding the model against\ngenerating responses related to the forget target, without destroying the\nfluency of text generation.

A desirable trajectory learning\nmodel should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining,\navoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar\nperformance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique\nspatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns\nand difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks\nfaces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required\nfor each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve\nlearning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region\ntransfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer.\n  To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS\ntrajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability.\nFor region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module\nwithin TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network\nmodalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context\ndistribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating\nrelative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for\nhandling movement patterns in diverse contexts.

However, acquiring large\nvolumes of high-quality data can be challenging, for example, collecting large\nnumbers of high-resolution images and long videos. On the other hand, there are\nmany complementary data that are usually considered corrupted or partial, such\nas low-resolution images and short videos. Other examples of corrupted data\ninclude videos that contain subtitles, watermarks, and logos. In this study, we\ninvestigate the theoretical problem of whether the above partial data can be\nutilized to train conventional diffusion models. Motivated by our theoretical\nanalysis in this study, we propose a straightforward approach of training\ndiffusion models utilizing partial data views, where we consider each form of\ncomplementary data as a view of conventional data. Our proposed approach first\ntrains one separate diffusion model for each individual view, and then trains a\nmodel for predicting the residual score function.

However, applying elaborate reasoning for all queries often results\nin substantial computational inefficiencies, particularly when many problems\nadmit straightforward solutions.

To answer this, we propose Thinkless, a learnable\nframework that empowers an LLM to adaptively select between short-form and\nlong-form reasoning, based on both task complexity and the model's ability.\nThinkless is trained under a reinforcement learning paradigm and employs two\ncontrol tokens, <short> for concise responses and <think> for detailed\nreasoning. At the core of our method is a Decoupled Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (DeGRPO) algorithm, which decomposes the learning objective of\nhybrid reasoning into two components: (1) a control token loss that governs the\nselection of the reasoning mode, and (2) a response loss that improves the\naccuracy of the generated answers. This decoupled formulation enables\nfine-grained control over the contributions of each objective, stabilizing\ntraining and effectively preventing collapse observed in vanilla GRPO.\nEmpirically, on several benchmarks such as Minerva Algebra, MATH-500, and\nGSM8K, Thinkless is able to reduce the usage of long-chain thinking by 50% -\n90%, significantly improving the efficiency of Reasoning Language Models.

We demonstrate that our orthogonal\nupdate strategy improves generalization accuracy and training stability across\ndiverse architectures (ResNetV2, Vision Transformers) and datasets (CIFARs,\nTinyImageNet, ImageNet-1k), achieving, for instance, a +4.3\\%p top-1 accuracy\ngain for ViT-B on ImageNet-1k.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u8f93\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u6d41\u7684\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6d41\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u8f93\u51fa\u76f4\u63a5\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u5757\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u4ec5\u6dfb\u52a0\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5f3a\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728ImageNet-1k\u4e0aViT-B\u7684top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u6b8b\u5dee\u66f4\u65b0\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "keywords": ["\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5", "\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u89e3", "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60", "\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60", "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387"]}}

This thesis proposes new unsupervised methods\nfor anomaly detection in both structured and streaming data settings. In the\nfirst part, we focus on structure-based anomaly detection, where normal data\nfollows low-dimensional manifolds while anomalies deviate from them. We\nintroduce Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), which embeds data into a\nhigh-dimensional preference space via manifold fitting, and isolates outliers\nusing two variants: Voronoi-iForest, based on geometric distances, and\nRuzHash-iForest, leveraging Locality Sensitive Hashing for scalability. We also\npropose Sliding-PIF, which captures local manifold information for streaming\nscenarios. Our methods outperform existing techniques on synthetic and real\ndatasets. We extend this to structure-based clustering with MultiLink, a novel\nmethod for recovering multiple geometric model families in noisy data.\nMultiLink merges clusters via a model-aware linkage strategy, enabling robust\nmulti-class structure recovery. It offers key advantages over existing\napproaches, such as speed, reduced sensitivity to thresholds, and improved\nrobustness to poor initial sampling. The second part of the thesis addresses\nonline anomaly detection in evolving data streams. We propose Online Isolation\nForest (Online-iForest), which uses adaptive, multi-resolution histograms and\ndynamically updates tree structures to track changes over time.

However, when\ncombined with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), LoRA\nfaces substantial noise amplification: DP-SGD perturbs per-sample gradients,\nand the matrix multiplication of the LoRA update ($BA$) intensifies this\neffect. Freezing one matrix (e.g., $A$) reduces the noise but restricts model\nexpressiveness, often resulting in suboptimal adaptation. To address this, we\npropose FedSVD, a simple yet effective method that introduces a global\nreparameterization based on singular value decomposition (SVD). In our\napproach, each client optimizes only the $B$ matrix and transmits it to the\nserver. The server aggregates the $B$ matrices, computes the product $BA$ using\nthe previous $A$, and refactorizes the result via SVD. This yields a new\nadaptive $A$ composed of the orthonormal right singular vectors of $BA$, and an\nupdated $B$ containing the remaining SVD components.

However, existing multimodal\nsafety evaluations primarily focus on model vulnerabilities exposed by static\nimage inputs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of video that may induce distinct\nsafety risks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-SafetyBench, the first\ncomprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LVLMs under\nvideo-text attacks. It comprises 2,264 video-text pairs spanning 48\nfine-grained unsafe categories, each pairing a synthesized video with either a\nharmful query, which contains explicit malice, or a benign query, which appears\nharmless but triggers harmful behavior when interpreted alongside the video.

However, the\nrobustness of the current training algorithm is not high enough.

In this article, by pruning matrix\nblocks and directly optimizing the individuals in population, we propose an\non-chip covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and attention-based\npruning (CAP) algorithm for large-scale BONNs.

Compared to serving a\nfull-sized LLM on an H800 GPU, our approach achieves over a 1000x speedup for\nquery inference with GPU acceleration, and even a 20x speedup without GPU.\nExperiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method\ngeneralizes well across diverse retrieval tasks, retaining an average of 95%\nfull-sized performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67e5\u8be2\u7f16\u7801\u5668LightRetriever\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u7f16\u7801\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574LLM\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7b80\u67e5\u8be2\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u67e5\u627e\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "result": "GPU\u52a0\u901f\u4e0b\u67e5\u8be2\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471000\u500d\uff0c\u65e0GPU\u65f6\u63d0\u534720\u500d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u630195%\u3002", "conclusion": "LightRetriever\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "keywords": ["Large Language Models", "hybrid retrieval", "query encoder", "efficiency"]}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce LogicOCR, a benchmark\ncomprising 1,100 multiple-choice questions designed to evaluate LMMs' logical\nreasoning abilities on text-rich images, while minimizing reliance on\ndomain-specific knowledge (e.g., mathematics). We construct LogicOCR by\ncurating a text corpus from the Chinese National Civil Servant Examination and\ndevelop a scalable, automated pipeline to convert it into multimodal samples.\nFirst, we design prompt templates to steer GPT-Image-1 to generate images with\ndiverse backgrounds, interleaved text-illustration layouts, and varied fonts,\nensuring contextual relevance and visual realism. Then, the generated images\nare manually verified, with low-quality examples discarded. We evaluate a range\nof representative open-source and proprietary LMMs under both Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) and direct-answer settings. Our multi-dimensional analysis reveals key\ninsights, such as the impact of test-time scaling, input modality differences,\nand sensitivity to visual-text orientation.

ViCA2 features a dual vision encoder architecture integrating SigLIP\nfor semantics and Hiera for spatial structure, coupled with a token ratio\ncontrol mechanism for efficiency. We also developed ViCA-322K, a new\nlarge-scale dataset with over 322,000 spatially grounded question-answer pairs\nfor targeted instruction tuning. On the challenging VSI-Bench benchmark, our\nViCA2-7B model achieves a state-of-the-art average score of 56.8, significantly\nsurpassing larger open-source models (e.g., LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B, 40.9) and\nleading proprietary models (Gemini-1.5 Pro, 45.4). This demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our approach in achieving strong visuospatial intelligence\nwith a compact model.

The current popular training paradigms primarily use\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the\nmodels' reasoning abilities. However, when using SFT or RL alone, there are\nrespective challenges: SFT may suffer from overfitting, while RL is prone to\nmode collapse. The state-of-the-art methods have proposed hybrid training\nschemes. However, static switching faces challenges such as poor generalization\nacross different tasks and high dependence on data quality. In response to\nthese challenges, inspired by the curriculum learning-quiz mechanism in human\nreasoning cultivation, We propose SASR, a step-wise adaptive hybrid training\nframework that theoretically unifies SFT and RL and dynamically balances the\ntwo throughout optimization.

TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels.\nAt the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction,\nlearning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals.\nThis is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both\ndetailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic\nembeddings for broader task understanding.

It also\nintroduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from\nmultiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary\nmodel outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves\nzero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias.

This paper proposes a Periodic Pattern Transformer\nNetwork (PPTNet) for traffic flow prediction, integrating periodic pattern\nextraction with the Transformer architecture, coupled with a fuzzy inference\nmethod for real-time congestion identification. Firstly, a high-precision\ntraffic flow dataset (Traffic Flow Dataset for China's Congested Highways and\nExpressways, TF4CHE) suitable for congested highway scenarios in China is\nconstructed based on drone aerial imagery data. Subsequently, the proposed\nPPTNet employs Fast Fourier Transform to capture multi-scale periodic patterns\nand utilizes two-dimensional Inception convolutions to efficiently extract\nintra and inter periodic features. A Transformer decoder dynamically models\ntemporal dependencies, enabling accurate predictions of traffic density and\nspeed. Finally, congestion probabilities are calculated in real-time using the\npredicted outcomes via a Mamdani fuzzy inference-based congestion\nidentification module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nPPTNet significantly outperforms mainstream traffic prediction methods in\nprediction accuracy, and the congestion identification module effectively\nidentifies real-time road congestion states, verifying the superiority and\npracticality of the proposed method in real-world traffic scenarios.

While existing methods perform well under\nnormal scenarios, their performance declines in adverse weather, due to\nchallenging domain shifts and difficulties in extracting scene information. To\naddress this issue, we present a robust monocular depth estimation method\ncalled \\textbf{ACDepth} from the perspective of high-quality training data\ngeneration and domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a one-step\ndiffusion model for generating samples that simulate adverse weather\nconditions, constructing a multi-tuple degradation dataset during training. To\nensure the quality of the generated degradation samples, we employ LoRA\nadapters to fine-tune the generation weights of diffusion model. Additionally,\nwe integrate circular consistency loss and adversarial training to guarantee\nthe fidelity and naturalness of the scene contents. Furthermore, we elaborate\non a multi-granularity knowledge distillation strategy (MKD) that encourages\nthe student network to absorb knowledge from both the teacher model and\npretrained Depth Anything V2.

In this paper, we study optimal decision-making\nbased on two-stage CATE estimators (e.g., DR-learner), which are considered\nstate-of-the-art and widely used in practice. We prove that, while such\nestimators may be optimal for estimating CATE, they can be suboptimal when used\nfor decision-making.

While its empirical benefits are well documented--enabling smaller\nstudent models to emulate the performance of much larger teachers--the\nunderlying mechanisms by which KD improves generative quality remain poorly\nunderstood. In this work, we present a minimal working explanation of KD in\ngenerative modeling. Using a controlled simulation with mixtures of Gaussians,\nwe demonstrate that distillation induces a trade-off between precision and\nrecall in the student model. As the teacher distribution becomes more\nselective, the student concentrates more probability mass on high-likelihood\nregions at the expense of coverage--a behavior modulated by a single\nentropy-controlling parameter.

Among the most promising BFMs are the ones that\nestimate the successor measure learned in an unsupervised way from\ntask-agnostic offline data. However, these methods fail to react to changes in\nthe dynamics, making them inefficient under partial observability or when the\ntransition function changes. This hinders the applicability of BFMs in a\nreal-world setting, e.g., in robotics, where the dynamics can unexpectedly\nchange at test time. In this work, we demonstrate that Forward-Backward (FB)\nrepresentation, one of the methods from the BFM family, cannot distinguish\nbetween distinct dynamics, leading to an interference among the latent\ndirections, which parametrize different policies.

Current selection strategies are myopic in nature in that\nthey are based on past or current interactions, often leading to inefficiency\nissues such as straggling clients. In this paper, we address this serious\nshortcoming by proposing the RIFLES approach that builds a novel availability\nforecasting layer to support the client selection process. We make the\nfollowing contributions: (i) we formalise the sequential selection problem and\nreduce it to a scheduling problem and show that the problem is NP-complete,\n(ii) leveraging heartbeat messages from clients, RIFLES build an availability\nprediction layer to support (long term) selection decisions, (iii) we propose a\nnovel adaptive selection strategy to support efficient learning and resource\nusage. To circumvent the inherent exponential complexity, we present RIFLES, a\nheuristic that leverages clients' historical availability data by using a\nCNN-LSTM time series forecasting model, allowing the server to predict the\noptimal participation times of clients, thereby enabling informed selection\ndecisions.

In conventional PIML, physical information is typically\nincorporated by constructing a hybrid loss function that combines data-driven\nloss and physics loss through linear scalarization. The goal is to find a\ntrade-off between these two objectives to improve the accuracy of model\npredictions. However, from a mathematical perspective, linear scalarization is\nlimited to identifying only the convex region of the Pareto front, as it treats\ndata-driven and physics losses as separate objectives. Given that most PIML\nloss functions are non-convex, linear scalarization restricts the achievable\ntrade-off solutions. Moreover, tuning the weighting coefficients for the two\nloss components can be both time-consuming and computationally challenging. To\naddress these limitations, this paper introduces a paradigm shift in PIML by\nreformulating the training process as a multi-objective optimization problem,\ntreating data-driven loss and physics loss independently. We apply several\nmulti-gradient descent algorithms (MGDAs), including traditional multi-gradient\ndescent (TMGD) and dual cone gradient descent (DCGD), to explore the Pareto\nfront in this multi-objective setting. These methods are evaluated on both\nmacroscopic and microscopic traffic flow models.

Our idea is to eliminate both gradients and optimizer states\nusing zeroth-order optimization, which approximates gradients by perturbing\nweights during forward passes to identify gradient directions. To minimize\nmemory usage on weights, we employ model quantization, e.g., converting from\nbfloat16 to int4.

Most existing\nsemi-supervised community detection algorithms detect communities based on\nknown ones, and the detected communities typically do not contain the given\nquery node. Therefore, they are not suitable for searching the community of a\ngiven node. Motivated by this, we adopt this paradigm into the semi-supervised\ncommunity search for the first time and propose Pre-trained Prompt-driven\nCommunity Search (PPCS), a novel model designed to enhance search accuracy and\nefficiency. PPCS consists of three main components: node encoding, sample\ngeneration, and prompt-driven fine-tuning. Specifically, the node encoding\ncomponent employs graph neural networks to learn local structural patterns of\nnodes in a graph, thereby obtaining representations for nodes and communities.\nNext, the sample generation component identifies an initial community for a\ngiven node and selects known communities that are structurally similar to the\ninitial one as training samples.

To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to\nidentify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt\nthe cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference\naudio.

However, when\nincorporating the two scaling dimensions, we find that the system efficiency is\ndampened significantly for two reasons. Firstly, the time cost to generate the\nfinal output increases substantially as many reasoning branches would be\ntrapped in the over-thinking dilemma, producing excessively long responses.\nSecondly, generating multiple reasoning branches for each request increases\nmemory consumption, which is unsuitable for LLM serving since we can only batch\na limited number of requests to process simultaneously. To address this, we\npresent SART, a serving framework for efficient and accurate LLM reasoning. The\nessential idea is to manage the thinking to be short and right, rather than\nlong. For one thing, we devise a redundant sampling with early stopping\napproach based on empirical observations and theoretic analysis, which\nincreases the likelihood of obtaining short-thinking responses when sampling\nreasoning branches. For another, we propose to dynamically prune low-quality\nbranches so that only right-thinking branches are maintained, reducing the\nmemory consumption and allowing us to batch more requests.

Unfortunately, such communication overhead\ntypically constitutes a significant portion of the total runtime, hampering the\nscalability of distributed training and inference for modern MoE models\n(consuming over $40\\%$ runtime in large-scale training). In this paper, we\nfirst define collaborative communication to illustrate this intrinsic\nlimitation, and then propose system- and algorithm-level innovations to reduce\ncommunication costs. Specifically, given a pair of experts co-activated by one\ntoken, we call them \"collaborated\", which comprises $2$ cases as intra- and\ninter-collaboration, depending on whether they are kept on the same device. Our\npilot investigations reveal that augmenting the proportion of\nintra-collaboration can accelerate expert parallelism at scale. It motivates us\nto strategically optimize collaborative communication for accelerated MoE\ntraining and inference, dubbed Occult.

A\nprominent strategy to mitigate this cost is distillation, with offline\ndistillation offering particular advantages in terms of efficiency, modularity,\nand flexibility. In this work, we identify two key observations that motivate a\nprincipled distillation framework: (1) while diffusion models have been viewed\nthrough the lens of dynamical systems theory, powerful and underexplored tools\ncan be further leveraged; and (2) diffusion models inherently impose\nstructured, semantically coherent trajectories in latent space. Building on\nthese observations, we introduce the Koopman Distillation Model KDM, a novel\noffline distillation approach grounded in Koopman theory-a classical framework\nfor representing nonlinear dynamics linearly in a transformed space. KDM\nencodes noisy inputs into an embedded space where a learned linear operator\npropagates them forward, followed by a decoder that reconstructs clean samples.\nThis enables single-step generation while preserving semantic fidelity. We\nprovide theoretical justification for our approach: (1) under mild assumptions,\nthe learned diffusion dynamics admit a finite-dimensional Koopman\nrepresentation; and (2) proximity in the Koopman latent space correlates with\nsemantic similarity in the generated outputs, allowing for effective trajectory\nalignment. Empirically, KDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nstandard offline distillation benchmarks, improving FID scores by up to 40% in\na single generation step.

Denoising Score Distillation\n(DSD) \\cite{chen2025denoising} recently introduced a novel and surprisingly\neffective strategy that leverages score distillation to train high-fidelity\ngenerative models directly from noisy observations. Building upon this\nfoundation, we propose \\textit{Restoration Score Distillation} (RSD), a\nprincipled generalization of DSD that accommodates a broader range of\ncorruption types, such as blurred, incomplete, or low-resolution images. RSD\noperates by first pretraining a teacher diffusion model solely on corrupted\ndata and subsequently distilling it into a single-step generator that produces\nhigh-quality reconstructions. Empirically, RSD consistently surpasses its\nteacher model across diverse restoration tasks on both natural and scientific\ndatasets. Moreover, beyond standard diffusion objectives, the RSD framework is\ncompatible with several corruption-aware training techniques such as Ambient\nTweedie, Ambient Diffusion, and its Fourier-space variant, enabling flexible\nintegration with recent advances in diffusion modeling. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that in a linear regime, RSD recovers the eigenspace of the clean\ndata covariance matrix from linear measurements, thereby serving as an implicit\nregularizer.

The interaction is modeled as a\nStackelberg game: the firm first decides how much of its proprietary dataset to\nshare with GenAI, and GenAI subsequently determines how much additional data to\nacquire from external experts. Their utilities depend on user traffic, monetary\ntransfers, and the cost of acquiring additional data from external experts. We\ncharacterize the unique subgame perfect equilibrium of the game and uncover a\nsurprising phenomenon: The firm may be willing to pay GenAI to share the firm's\nown data, leading to a costly data-sharing equilibrium.

It eliminates the need to build models from scratch,\ninstead relying on specifications (representations of a model's capabilities)\nto identify and leverage the most suitable models for new tasks. While\nlearnware has proven effective in many scenarios, its application to language\nmodels has remained largely unexplored. At the same time, large language models\n(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable universal question-answering abilities, yet\nthey face challenges in specialized scenarios due to data scarcity, privacy\nconcerns, and high computational costs, thus more and more specialized small\nlanguage models (SLMs) are being trained for specific domains. To address these\nlimitations systematically, the learnware paradigm provides a promising\nsolution by enabling maximum utilization of specialized SLMs, and allowing\nusers to identify and reuse them in a collaborative and privacy-preserving\nmanner.\n  This paper presents a preliminary attempt to apply the learnware paradigm to\nlanguage models. We simulated a learnware system comprising approximately 100\nlearnwares of specialized SLMs with 8B parameters, fine-tuned across finance,\nhealthcare, and mathematics domains. Each learnware contains an SLM and a\nspecification, which enables users to identify the most relevant models without\nexposing their own data. Experimental results demonstrate promising\nperformance: by selecting one suitable learnware for each task-specific\ninference, the system outperforms the base SLMs on all benchmarks.

In this paper, we\nintroduce ViEEG, a biologically inspired hierarchical EEG decoding framework\nthat aligns with the Hubel-Wiesel theory of visual processing. ViEEG decomposes\neach visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour,\nforeground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream\nEEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via\ncross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from V1 to IT to\nthe association cortex. We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning to\nalign EEG representations with CLIP embeddings, enabling zero-shot object\nrecognition.

Our study yields three key findings:\n(i) LKA failures can be systematically categorized into perception, planning,\nand control errors. We present representative examples of each failure mode\nthrough in-depth analysis of LKA-related CAN signals, enabling both\njustification of the failure mechanisms and diagnosis of when and where each\nmodule begins to degrade; (ii) LKA systems tend to follow a fixed\nlane-centering strategy, often resulting in outward drift that increases\nlinearly with road curvature, whereas human drivers proactively steer slightly\ninward on similar curved segments; (iii) We provide the first statistical\nsummary and distribution analysis of environmental and road conditions under\nLKA failures, identifying with statistical significance that faded lane\nmarkings, low pavement laneline contrast, and sharp curvature are the most\ndominant individual factors, along with critical combinations that\nsubstantially increase failure likelihood.

To bridge the gap between\nautomated assistance and effective human oversight, we present LKAlert, a novel\nsupervisory alert system that leverages VLM to forecast potential LKA risk 1-3\nseconds in advance. LKAlert processes dash-cam video and CAN data, integrating\nsurrogate lane segmentation features from a parallel interpretable model as\nautomated guiding attention. Unlike traditional binary classifiers, LKAlert\nissues both predictive alert and concise natural language explanation,\nenhancing driver situational awareness and trust. To support the development\nand evaluation of such systems, we introduce OpenLKA-Alert, the first benchmark\ndataset designed for predictive and explainable LKA failure warnings. It\ncontains synchronized multimodal inputs and human-authored justifications\nacross annotated temporal windows. We further contribute a generalizable\nmethodological framework for VLM-based black-box behavior prediction, combining\nsurrogate feature guidance with LoRA.

The method follows a two-step procedure: we\nfirst estimate the drift term function, then the (matrix-valued) diffusion\nfunction given the drift. Occupation kernels are integral functionals on a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that aggregate information over a\ntrajectory. Our approach leverages vector-valued occupation kernels for\nestimating the drift component of the stochastic process. For diffusion\nestimation, we extend this framework by introducing operator-valued occupation\nkernels, enabling the estimation of an auxiliary matrix-valued function as a\npositive semi-definite operator, from which we readily derive the diffusion\nestimate. This enables us to avoid common challenges in SDE learning, such as\nintractable likelihoods, by optimizing a reconstruction-error-based objective.\nWe propose a simple learning procedure that retains strong predictive accuracy\nwhile using Fenchel duality to promote efficiency.

Because of its simplicity and\nscalability, it is becoming a popular underlying scheme for recent large-scale\nMAPF methods involving several hundreds or thousands of agents. Vanilla PIBT\nmakes agents behave greedily towards their assigned goals, while agents\ntypically have multiple best actions, since the graph shortest path is not\nalways unique. Consequently, tiebreaking about how to choose between these\nactions significantly affects resulting solutions. This paper studies two\nsimple yet effective techniques for tiebreaking in PIBT, without compromising\nits computational advantage. The first technique allows an agent to\nintelligently dodge another, taking into account whether each action will\nhinder the progress of the next timestep.

Recently, approaches leveraging pre-trained models\nhave gained increasing popularity to mitigate this issue, due to the strong\ngeneralization ability of foundation models. To adjust pre-trained models for\nnew tasks, existing methods usually employ low-rank adaptation, which restricts\nparameter updates to a fixed low-rank subspace. However, constraining the\noptimization space inherently compromises the model's learning capacity,\nresulting in inferior performance. To address the limitation, we propose\nContinuous Subspace Optimization for Continual Learning (CoSO) to fine-tune the\nmodel in a series of subspaces rather than a single one. These sequential\nsubspaces are dynamically determined through the singular value decomposition\nof gradients. CoSO updates the model by projecting gradients into these\nsubspaces, ensuring memory-efficient optimization.

However, a major problem is\ncatastrophic forgetting, where models lose their ability to recognize earlier\nkeywords. Although several continual learning methods have proven their\nusefulness for reducing forgetting, most existing approaches depend on storing\nand revisiting old data to combat catastrophic forgetting. Though effective,\nthese methods face two practical challenges: 1) privacy risks from keeping user\ndata and 2) large memory and time consumption that limit deployment on small\ndevices. To address these issues, we propose an exemplar-free Analytic\nContinual Learning (AnalyticKWS) method that updates model parameters without\nrevisiting earlier data. Inspired by efficient learning principles, AnalyticKWS\ncomputes a closed-form analytical solution for model updates and requires only\na single epoch of adaptation for incoming keywords. AnalyticKWS demands fewer\ncomputational resources by avoiding gradient-based updates and does not store\nold data. By eliminating the need for back-propagation during incremental\nlearning, the model remains lightweight and efficient.

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art separation quality on multiple public datasets while\nsignificantly reducing both computational cost and model complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6539\u8fdb\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u53cd\u5c04\u53bb\u9664\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u53cd\u5c04\u53bb\u9664\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u79bb\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u53cc\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u79bb\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u53cd\u5c04\u53bb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "keywords": ["\u53cc\u6d41\u67b6\u6784", "\u53cd\u5c04\u53bb\u9664", "\u5c42\u95f4\u4e92\u8865\u6027", "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236"]}}

Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the\ninclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in\nnear-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the\nNEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing\ntime is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the\ncandidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are\ninsufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives\nand minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for\nNEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30\ndistinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as\nNEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based\non selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs\nfrom the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also\ninvestigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is,\nthe gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to\nclassify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as\ninput, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in\ndistinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2\nparameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a\nsignificant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting\nthe loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%.

In particular, we divide the local\nmodel into a feature extractor and a classifier. In each iteration, the clients\nonly upload the parameters of a feature extractor after local training. The\nserver then aggregates these local parameters and returns the results to the\nclients.\n  Each client retains its own classifier layer, ensuring that the backdoor\nlabels do not impact other clients. We assess the effectiveness of FL-PLAS\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor attacks on three image datasets and\ncompare our approach to six defense strategies. The results of the experiment\ndemonstrate that our methods can effectively protect local models from backdoor\nattacks. Without requiring any auxiliary dataset for the server, our method\nachieves a high main-task accuracy with a lower backdoor accuracy even under\nthe condition of 90\\% malicious users with the attacks of trigger, semantic and\nedge-case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFL-PLAS\u7684\u65b0\u9632\u5fa1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u62b5\u5fa1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u5c42\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u540e\u95e8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65e5\u76ca\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6076\u610f\u7528\u6237\u6216\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002FL-PLAS\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FL-PLAS\u5c06\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4ec5\u4e0a\u4f20\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fd4\u56de\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5c42\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u540e\u95e8\u6807\u7b7e\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "FL-PLAS\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f90%\u7528\u6237\u6076\u610f\uff0c\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u540e\u95e8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "FL-PLAS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6297\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "keywords": ["\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60", "\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb", "\u9632\u5fa1\u7b97\u6cd5", "FL-PLAS", "\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408"]}}

We\npresent numerical experiments on both synthetic and real examples,\ndemonstrating the robustness of our method for direction-of-arrival estimation\nin nonuniform noise and subspace recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTyler M\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u62df\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982PCA\u6216\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\u5bf9\u91cd\u5c3e\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTyler M\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684EM\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u692d\u5706\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u65bd\u52a0\u4f4e\u79e9\u52a0\u5bf9\u89d2\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5747\u5300\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684DOA\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "keywords": ["\u7edf\u8ba1\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b", "\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1", "EM\u7b97\u6cd5", "Tyler M\u4f30\u8ba1", "\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784"]}}

Classifying\nmalware programs into their respective families is essential for building\neffective defenses against cyber threats. Machine learning models have a huge\npotential in malware detection on mobile devices, as malware families can be\nrecognized by classifying permission data extracted from Android manifest\nfiles. Still, the malware classification task is challenging due to the\nhigh-dimensional nature of permission data and the limited availability of\ntraining samples. In particular, the steady emergence of new malware families\nmakes it impossible to acquire a comprehensive training set covering all the\nmalware classes. In this work, we present a malware classification system that,\non top of classifying known malware, detects new ones.

Existing language-conditioned motion\nmodels often struggle with scene-aware motion generation due to limitations in\nmotion tokenization, which leads to information loss and fails to capture the\ncontinuous, context-dependent nature of 3D human movement. To address these\nissues, we propose UniHM, a unified motion language model that leverages\ndiffusion-based generation for synthesizing scene-aware human motion. UniHM is\nthe first framework to support both Text-to-Motion and Text-to-Human-Object\nInteraction (HOI) in complex 3D scenes. Our approach introduces three key\ncontributions: (1) a mixed-motion representation that fuses continuous 6DoF\nmotion with discrete local motion tokens to improve motion realism; (2) a novel\nLook-Up-Free Quantization VAE (LFQ-VAE) that surpasses traditional VQ-VAEs in\nboth reconstruction accuracy and generative performance; and (3) an enriched\nversion of the Lingo dataset augmented with HumanML3D annotations, providing\nstronger supervision for scene-specific motion learning.

While\nhigh-field MRI (HF-MRI) is standard in research and clinical settings, its\nlimited availability hinders widespread use. Low-field MRI (LF-MRI),\nparticularly portable systems, offers a cost-effective and accessible\nalternative. However, existing cortical surface analysis tools are optimized\nfor high-resolution HF-MRI and struggle with the lower signal-to-noise ratio\nand resolution of LF-MRI. In this work, we present a machine learning method\nfor 3D reconstruction and analysis of portable LF-MRI across a range of\ncontrasts and resolutions. Our method works \"out of the box\" without\nretraining. It uses a 3D U-Net trained on synthetic LF-MRI to predict signed\ndistance functions of cortical surfaces, followed by geometric processing to\nensure topological accuracy. We evaluate our method using paired HF/LF-MRI\nscans of the same subjects, showing that LF-MRI surface reconstruction accuracy\ndepends on acquisition parameters, including contrast type (T1 vs T2),\norientation (axial vs isotropic), and resolution. A 3mm isotropic T2-weighted\nscan acquired in under 4 minutes, yields strong agreement with HF-derived\nsurfaces: surface area correlates at r=0.96, cortical parcellations reach\nDice=0.98, and gray matter volume achieves r=0.93.

Translations between each modality are established as core\ntasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription\n(audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score).\nHowever, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on\nindividual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach,\nwhere we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks\nsimultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new\nlarge-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose\na new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score\nimage data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger\nthan any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified\ntokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into\na sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle\nmultiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task.\nExperimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon\nsingle-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error\nrate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%,\nwhile similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other\ntranslation tasks.

Physics-informed machine learning (ML)\nmethods such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) introduce prior\nknowledge through loss functions to ensure physical consistency, but their\n\"soft constraints\" are usually not strictly satisfied. Here, we propose LaPON,\nan operator network inspired by the Lagrange's mean value theorem, which embeds\nprior knowledge directly into the neural network architecture instead of the\nloss function, making the neural network naturally satisfy the given\nconstraints. This is a hybrid framework that combines neural operators with\ntraditional numerical methods, where neural operators are used to compensate\nfor the effect of discretization errors on the analytical scale in\nunder-resolution simulations. As evaluated on turbulence problem modeled by the\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSE), the multiple time step extrapolation accuracy\nand stability of LaPON exceed the direct numerical simulation baseline at 8x\ncoarser grids and 8x larger time steps, while achieving a vorticity correlation\nof more than 0.98 with the ground truth.

However, such frame-based methods inherently face\nchallenges in achieving low-latency performance and often fail in\nresource-constrained environments. Visual object tracking using bio-inspired\nevent cameras has emerged as a promising research direction in recent years,\noffering distinct advantages for low-latency applications. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Slow-Fast Tracking paradigm that flexibly adapts to different\noperational requirements, termed SFTrack. The proposed framework supports two\ncomplementary modes, i.e., a high-precision slow tracker for scenarios with\nsufficient computational resources, and an efficient fast tracker tailored for\nlatency-aware, resource-constrained environments. Specifically, our framework\nfirst performs graph-based representation learning from\nhigh-temporal-resolution event streams, and then integrates the learned\ngraph-structured information into two FlashAttention-based vision backbones,\nyielding the slow and fast trackers, respectively. The fast tracker achieves\nlow latency through a lightweight network design and by producing multiple\nbounding box outputs in a single forward pass.

Riemannian optimization offers a powerful\nframework for solving these problems by equipping the constraint set with a\nRiemannian manifold structure and performing optimization intrinsically on the\nmanifold.

However, as\nthe size of the variables increases, the computational cost of the retraction\ncan become prohibitively high, limiting the applicability of Riemannian\noptimization to large-scale problems. To address this challenge and enhance\nscalability, we propose a novel approach that restricts each update on a random\nsubmanifold, thereby significantly reducing the per-iteration complexity.

However, the\nsecurity implications of these agents remain largely unexplored. In this paper,\nwe present the first comprehensive security analysis of mobile LLM agents,\nencompassing three representative categories: System-level AI Agents developed\nby original equipment manufacturers (e.g., YOYO Assistant), Third-party\nUniversal Agents (e.g., Zhipu AI AutoGLM), and Emerging Agent Frameworks (e.g.,\nAlibaba Mobile Agent). We begin by analyzing the general workflow of mobile\nagents and identifying security threats across three core capability\ndimensions: language-based reasoning, GUI-based interaction, and system-level\nexecution. Our analysis reveals 11 distinct attack surfaces, all rooted in the\nunique capabilities and interaction patterns of mobile LLM agents, and spanning\ntheir entire operational lifecycle. To investigate these threats in practice,\nwe introduce AgentScan, a semi-automated security analysis framework that\nsystematically evaluates mobile LLM agents across all 11 attack scenarios.\nApplying AgentScan to nine widely deployed agents, we uncover a concerning\ntrend: every agent is vulnerable to targeted attacks. In the most severe cases,\nagents exhibit vulnerabilities across eight distinct attack vectors. These\nattacks can cause behavioral deviations, privacy leakage, or even full\nexecution hijacking.

A key property of many tensor decompositions, such as the canonical\npolyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to\ntrivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the\ngroundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a\ncentral and widely used tensor decomposition model.

A Poly-modal Inductor for Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection", "categories": ["cs.CV", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Weakly-supervised methods for video anomaly detection (VAD) are\nconventionally based merely on RGB spatio-temporal features, which continues to\nlimit their reliability in real-world scenarios. This is due to the fact that\nRGB-features are not sufficiently distinctive in setting apart categories such\nas shoplifting from visually similar events. Therefore, towards robust complex\nreal-world VAD, it is essential to augment RGB spatio-temporal features by\nadditional modalities. Motivated by this, we introduce the Poly-modal Induced\nframework for VAD: \"PI-VAD\", a novel approach that augments RGB representations\nby five additional modalities. Specifically, the modalities include sensitivity\nto fine-grained motion (Pose), three dimensional scene and entity\nrepresentation (Depth), surrounding objects (Panoptic masks), global motion\n(optical flow), as well as language cues (VLM). Each modality represents an\naxis of a polygon, streamlined to add salient cues to RGB.

Spline dimensional\ndecomposition (SDD) effectively addresses such nonlinearity by partitioning\ninput coordinates via knot placement, yet its accuracy is highly sensitive to\nthe location of internal knots. Optimizing knots through sequential quadratic\nprogramming can be effective, yet the optimization process becomes\ncomputationally intense. We propose a computationally efficient,\ninterpolation-based method for optimal knot selection in SDD. The method\ninvolves three steps: (1) interpolating input-output profiles, (2) defining\nsubinterval-based reference regions, and (3) selecting optimal knot locations\nat maximum gradient points within each region. The resulting knot vector is\nthen applied to SDD for accurate approximation of non-smooth and locally\noscillating responses. A modal analysis of a lower control arm demonstrates\nthat SDD with the proposed knot selection achieves higher accuracy than SDD\nwith uniformly or randomly spaced knots, and also a Gaussian process surrogate\nmodel. The proposed SDD exhibits the lowest relative variance error (2.89%),\ncompared to SDD with uniformly spaced knots (12.310%), randomly spaced knots\n(15.274%), and Gaussian process (5.319%) in the first natural frequency\ndistribution.

Despite\ntheir practical success, the theoretical understanding of model selection,\nespecially concerning the optimal number of mixture components or experts,\nremains limited and poses significant challenges.

However, existing approaches often\noverlook the potential of integrating radiometric information from RGB images.\nThis limitation reduces their effectiveness in aligning point clouds pairs,\nespecially in regions where geometric data alone is insufficient. When used\neffectively, radiometric information can enhance the registration process by\nproviding context that is missing from purely geometric data. In this paper, we\npropose CoFF, a novel Cross-modal Feature Fusion method that utilizes both\npoint cloud geometry and RGB images for pairwise point cloud registration.\nAssuming that the co-registration between point clouds and RGB images is\navailable, CoFF explicitly addresses the challenges where geometric information\nalone is unclear, such as in regions with symmetric similarity or planar\nstructures, through a two-stage fusion of 3D point cloud features and 2D image\nfeatures. It incorporates a cross-modal feature fusion module that assigns\npixel-wise image features to 3D input point clouds to enhance learned 3D point\nfeatures, and integrates patch-wise image features with superpoint features to\nimprove the quality of coarse matching. This is followed by a coarse-to-fine\nmatching module that accurately establishes correspondences using the fused\nfeatures. We extensively evaluate CoFF on four common datasets: 3DMatch,\n3DLoMatch, IndoorLRS, and the recently released ScanNet++ datasets. In\naddition, we assess CoFF on specific subset datasets containing geometrically\nambiguous cases. Our experimental results demonstrate that CoFF achieves\nstate-of-the-art registration performance across all benchmarks, including\nremarkable registration recalls of 95.9% and 81.6% on the widely-used 3DMatch\nand 3DLoMatch datasets, respectively...(Truncated to fit arXiv abstract length)", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5CoFF\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u533a\u57df\u914d\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8f90\u5c04\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u8865\u5145\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u914d\u51c6\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "CoFF\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5c06\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u914d\u7ed93D\u70b9\u4e91\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8d85\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7c97\u5339\u914d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7cbe\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u5efa\u7acb\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u57283DMatch\u30013DLoMatch\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u914d\u51c6\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe95.9%\u548c81.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "CoFF\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u3002", "keywords": ["\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6", "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408", "RGB\u56fe\u50cf", "\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e", "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60"]}}

Our\nfindings indicate that the active sampling approaches, driven by uncertainty\nmetrics, surpass a random sampling baseline in terms of accuracy and stability.\nAdditionally, while in our human study, the participants achieve an average\naccuracy of 48.00%, our best approach achieves an average accuracy of 88.78% on\nthe same set of objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based\ntactile sensors for object hardness classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u786c\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u786c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u786c\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523088.78%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u786c\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "keywords": ["\u786c\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b", "\u89c6\u89c9\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668", "\u4e3b\u52a8\u91c7\u6837", "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5"]}}

This framework enables human decision-makers to audit and\nvalidate their own decisions under uncertainty, bridging the gap between\nalgorithmic tools and real-world judgment.", "AI": {"tldr": "CREDO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9006\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u5019\u9009\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u3001\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u516c\u5171\u653f\u7b56\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b3\u7b56\u8106\u5f31\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "CREDO\u7ed3\u5408\u9006\u4f18\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u683c\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc1\u4e66\u3002", "result": "CREDO\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5ba1\u6838\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "CREDO\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5224\u65ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002", "keywords": ["\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56", "\u9884\u6d4b\u4f18\u5316", "\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027", "CREDO\u6846\u67b6"]}}

Yet, existing works focus mainly on considering the\nshape of objects to optimize packing compactness and neglect object properties\nsuch as fragility, edibility, and chemistry that humans typically consider when\npacking objects. This paper presents OPA-Pack (Object-Property-Aware Packing\nframework), the first framework that equips the robot with object property\nconsiderations in planning the object packing. Technical-wise, we develop a\nnovel object property recognition scheme with retrieval-augmented generation\nand chain-of-thought reasoning, and build a dataset with object property\nannotations for 1,032 everyday objects. Also, we formulate OPA-Net, aiming to\njointly separate incompatible object pairs and reduce pressure on fragile\nobjects, while compacting the packing. Further, OPA-Net consists of a property\nembedding layer to encode the property of candidate objects to be packed,\ntogether with a fragility heightmap and an avoidance heightmap to keep track of\nthe packed objects. Then, we design a reward function and adopt a deep\nQ-learning scheme to train OPA-Net. Experimental results manifest that OPA-Pack\ngreatly improves the accuracy of separating incompatible object pairs (from 52%\nto 95%) and largely reduces pressure on fragile objects (by 29.4%), while\nmaintaining good packing compactness.

The most substantial impact came from the required\nconfidence ratings and explanations, which students reported transferring to\ntheir actual exam strategies.

The quality of the VT\nlargely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current\ndiscrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders\n(VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of\ndetails and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality,\nwithout isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core\ntasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and\ncovers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess\nstate-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of\nreconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior\nvisual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining\nspatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded\nrepresentations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted\nreconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text\nand object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image\ngeneration and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the\nrole of visual tokenization.
