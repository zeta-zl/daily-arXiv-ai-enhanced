We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the\ndegree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social\nbiases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems\nthrough scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined\ncontexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent\njudging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses\nlabeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)\nacross four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses\nassigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior\nresponse.

Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness.

(2) If not, what\nother properties could be considered as general principles for answer set\nsemantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three\naforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with\nexamples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we\nevolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by\nrefining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality\nw.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation.

To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness.

Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment\nstrategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.\nExperimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior\npredictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to\nexisting methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational\ncomplexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for\nefficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery\nand material design."}

This paper seeks to understand how such\nmodels behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing\nspecifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,\nan image of a dog paired with the caption \"A photo of a cat\") and ask the model\nto report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,\n\"What does the caption say / What is in the image?\"). We find that models often\nfavor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what\nthe caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they\nfavor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in\nthe internal representational structure of the model, and that specific\nattention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over\nthe other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic \"router heads\" which appear to\npromote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can\nbe manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets\nand modalities.

We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that\njointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of\npre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both\nreconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as\na method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure\nfrom disjoint inputs.

We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this\ntoy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from\nrandomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the\ntransformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its\ncontext when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking\na closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two\nfunctions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that\nsystem to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system\nto predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first\ncapability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second\ncapability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much\nearlier.\n  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model\nweights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy\nproblem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the\ndiscrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the\nstart of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,\nwhich is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a\n\"Bayesian-style\" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These\ntwo mechanisms have different learning dynamics.\n  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase\ntransitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used\nOLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar\nphenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs\nsecond-task-token performance."}

We found that our\nproposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared\nagainst the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.\nMoreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory\nfootprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also\nevaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the\nRVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that\nare 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our\nproposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions."}

While recent works\nhave effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting\nenvironments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy\nproblems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic\nsimulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated\ntraining of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios\nbased on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines.\nChargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over\n100x-1000x over existing environments.

In this paper, we propose a unified\nview of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that\nsynergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical\nreasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is\nboth simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone\nSFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key\nadvantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,\nrequiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis\nhighlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that\nPrefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,\nablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality\nand quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective\non LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously\nintegrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for\nfuture research."}

However, 2) they are respectable generalists;\nthis is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based\ntasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)\nWhile the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit\nless sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among\nnon-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)\nreasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a\npreliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest\nGPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial\nmisalignments."}

This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems\nhave limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning.\nFortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in\nenhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT\nthrough extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile\nmanipulation tasks."}

While ordinal comparison data\nintuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper\nchallenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework\nfor modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a\ngeneralized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the\npreference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the\ndistribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical\nbinary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as\nbinarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that\nbinarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking\nrecovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking\nerror associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential\nconvergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a\nsubstantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function.

Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can\nbe fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with\nlimited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained\nfrom scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,\nthereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label\nefficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of\nfine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000\nthoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public\ndatasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease\nclassification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,\nwhile generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a\nmasked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable\nsolution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive\nmodels by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest\ncomputational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays\nthe foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools\nthat could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular\nfocus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management\nin high-risk populations."}

Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising\ncathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its\nelectrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as\ngrain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping\nmethods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough\ntransform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling\ncomplex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale\nmicrostructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach\nfor predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated\ngeneration of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the\nanalysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning\narchitectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional\nNetworks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated,\nusing an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM\nalgorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin\nTransformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer\nachieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural\npredictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary\ndelineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring\nthe potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based\nimage data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine\nlearning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural\ncharacterization."}

In this\nwork, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention\nheads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can\nalter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive\nrescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to\ncounteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of\nLLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B.

We\nintroduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning\nparadigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse\npreference distributions.

Stellar\nspectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical\ninformation about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves\npre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed\nby contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different\ninstruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets\nimproves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and\nchemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and\nprecision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.\nAdditionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities\noffer potential for anomaly detection.

A common approach to understanding these systems is to\nmodel the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between\nthem. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the\nsubsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the\ndirectionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between\nsubsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically\nlinear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by\nnonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven\nnonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions\nvia the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning\nJacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning\nmethod that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for\narbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs\noutperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,\nincluding high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we\nshow that the \"sensory\" area gains greater control over the \"cognitive\" area\nover learning.
