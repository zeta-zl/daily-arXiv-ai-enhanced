### [1] [EvidenceOutcomes: a Dataset of Clinical Trial Publications with Clinically Meaningful Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05380)
*Yiliang Zhou,Abigail M. Newbury,Gongbo Zhang,Betina Ross Idnay,Hao Liu,Chunhua Weng,Yifan Peng*

Key words: PICO, 证据医学, 生物医学文献, 结局提取, PubMedBERT

TL;DR: 该研究提出了EvidenceOutcomes，一个高质量注释的生物医学文献结局数据集，旨在改善基于证据医学中的PICO元素提取，尤其是复杂结局的忽略问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前基于证据医学中的PICO元素提取中，结局元素常被忽视或简化，需要高质量标注数据集以改进此问题。

Method: 通过制定严格的注释指南，由三名独立标注者对500篇PubMed摘要和140篇EBM-NLP摘要的结局进行标注，并基于PubMedBERT模型进行微调。

Result: 标注数据集的评分者一致性为0.76，模型的F1分数在实体级和令牌级分别为0.69和0.76。

Conclusion: EvidenceOutcomes可作为未来机器学习算法开发的高质量基准数据集。

Abstract: The fundamental process of evidence extraction and synthesis in
evidence-based medicine involves extracting PICO (Population, Intervention,
Comparison, and Outcome) elements from biomedical literature. However,
Outcomes, being the most complex elements, are often neglected or
oversimplified in existing benchmarks. To address this issue, we present
EvidenceOutcomes, a novel, large, annotated corpus of clinically meaningful
outcomes extracted from biomedical literature. We first developed a robust
annotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text
through iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language
Processing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results
and Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts
and 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus. This resulted in
EvidenceOutcomes with high-quality annotations of an inter-rater agreement of
0.76. Additionally, our fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, applied to these 500
PubMed abstracts, achieved an F1-score of 0.69 at the entity level and 0.76 at
the token level on the subset of 140 PubMed abstracts from the EBM-NLP corpus.
EvidenceOutcomes can serve as a shared benchmark to develop and test future
machine learning algorithms to extract clinically meaningful outcomes from
biomedical abstracts.

### [2] [LLMs Can Also Do Well! Breaking Barriers in Semantic Role Labeling via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05385)
*Xinxin Li,Huiyao Chen,Chengjun Liu,Jing Li,Meishan Zhang,Jun Yu,Min Zhang*

Key words: 语义角色标注, 大语言模型, 检索增强生成, 自校正

TL;DR: 该论文通过检索增强生成和自校正机制，使大语言模型在语义角色标注任务中首次超越编码器-解码器模型，取得了最先进的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 尽管生成式解码器大语言模型在多任务中表现出色，但在语义角色标注任务中仍落后于编码器-解码器模型，因此作者希望通过新的机制弥补这一差距。

Method: 通过检索增强生成机制利用外部语言学知识（如谓词和论元结构描述），并结合自校正机制识别和修正不一致的输出。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试（CPB1.0、CoNLL-2009和CoNLL-2012）上，该方法在中英文任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功使大语言模型在语义角色标注任务中超越编码器-解码器模型。

Abstract: Semantic role labeling (SRL) is a crucial task of natural language processing
(NLP). Although generative decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable success across various NLP tasks, they still lag behind
state-of-the-art encoder-decoder (BERT-like) models in SRL. In this work, we
seek to bridge this gap by equipping LLMs for SRL with two mechanisms: (a)
retrieval-augmented generation and (b) self-correction. The first mechanism
enables LLMs to leverage external linguistic knowledge such as predicate and
argument structure descriptions, while the second allows LLMs to identify and
correct inconsistent SRL outputs. We conduct extensive experiments on three
widely-used benchmarks of SRL (CPB1.0, CoNLL-2009, and CoNLL-2012). Results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
Chinese and English, marking the first successful application of LLMs to
surpass encoder-decoder approaches in SRL.

### [3] [Beyond RAG: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05386)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Chengshuai Zhao,Yu-Hua Zeng,Yuan Jee Lim,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Key words: 临床笔记生成,强化学习,检索增强生成,出院指示,医学知识图谱

TL;DR: R2AG是一种基于强化学习的检索增强生成方法，用于从入院前数据生成长篇幅出院指示，通过检索医学知识图谱中的推理路径提供语义指导。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的基于大型语言模型（LLM）的方法从有限的患者信息生成长篇幅临床笔记时表现不佳，因此需要一种新方法来弥补信息差距并提高生成质量。

Method: R2AG采用强化学习训练检索器，从医学知识图谱检索推理路径，并结合基于组的检索优化（GRO）提升检索质量。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV-Note数据集上，R2AG在临床效果和自然语言生成指标上均优于基线模型，并能填补输入稀疏场景的语义空白。

Conclusion: R2AG通过检索的推理路径帮助LLM避免临床误解，并专注于关键证据和连贯推理，提升了长篇幅临床笔记生成的性能。

Abstract: Clinical note generation aims to automatically produce free-text summaries of
a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being
a representative long-form example. While recent large language model
(LLM)-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in
clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from
limited patient information. In this paper, we propose R2AG, the first
reinforced retriever for long-form discharge instruction generation based on
pre-admission data. R2AG is trained with reinforcement learning to retrieve
reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph, providing explicit semantic
guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose Group-Based
Retriever Optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with
group-relative rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the
LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset show that R2AG
outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation
metrics. Further analysis reveals that R2AG fills semantic gaps in sparse input
scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical
misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning.

### [4] [Advancing Decoding Strategies: Enhancements in Locally Typical Sampling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05387)
*Jaydip Sen,Saptarshi Sengupta. Subhasis Dasgupta*

Key words: 大语言模型, 解码策略, 典型采样, ASTS, 文本生成

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的典型采样算法ASTS，通过动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励惩罚调整，提升了大语言模型解码的流畅性和多样性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统的解码方法（如top-k和核采样）在平衡文本生成的流畅性、多样性和连贯性方面存在困难，因此需要更优的算法。

Method: 提出了ASTS（自适应语义感知典型采样），结合动态熵阈值、多目标评分和奖励惩罚调整，改进典型采样算法。

Result: 在多任务基准测试中，ASTS的表现优于现有采样技术，减少了重复、增强了语义对齐并提高了流畅性。

Conclusion: ASTS能够生成上下文连贯且多样化的文本，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language
models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS)
algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling,
often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation.
To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS)
is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy
thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS
ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining
computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple
benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using
metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results
demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing
repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

### [5] [taz2024full: Analysing German Newspapers for Gender Bias and Discrimination across Decades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05388)
*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Key words: 德语语料库、性别偏见、自然语言处理、社交媒体、taz2024full

TL;DR: 论文介绍了taz2024full，这是迄今为止最大的公开可用德语报纸语料库，包含1980年至2024年的180多万篇文章，旨在支持自然语言处理和社会科学研究。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决德语大规模语料资源匮乏的问题，支持对性别偏见等社会议题的研究。

Method: 构建taz2024full语料库，并使用可扩展的结构化分析管道进行性别表征分析。

Result: 研究发现男性在报道中持续过度代表，但近年来逐渐趋于平衡。

Conclusion: 语料库支持广泛的研究应用，促进德语自然语言处理的包容性和可重复性研究。

Abstract: Open-access corpora are essential for advancing natural language processing
(NLP) and computational social science (CSS). However, large-scale resources
for German remain limited, restricting research on linguistic trends and
societal issues such as gender bias. We present taz2024full, the largest
publicly available corpus of German newspaper articles to date, comprising over
1.8 million texts from taz, spanning 1980 to 2024.
  As a demonstration of the corpus's utility for bias and discrimination
research, we analyse gender representation across four decades of reporting. We
find a consistent overrepresentation of men, but also a gradual shift toward
more balanced coverage in recent years. Using a scalable, structured analysis
pipeline, we provide a foundation for studying actor mentions, sentiment, and
linguistic framing in German journalistic texts.
  The corpus supports a wide range of applications, from diachronic language
analysis to critical media studies, and is freely available to foster inclusive
and reproducible research in German-language NLP.

### [6] [Understanding Gender Bias in AI-Generated Product Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05390)
*Markelle Kelly,Mohammad Tahaei,Padhraic Smyth,Lauren Wilcox*

Key words: 大型语言模型、性别偏见、电子商务、产品描述生成、算法危害

TL;DR: 研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在电子商务中生成产品描述时的性别偏见，提出了一种数据驱动的分类方法，并分析了GPT-3.5和电子商务专用LLM中常见的偏见形式。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探索LLMs在电子商务应用中未被充分研究的性别偏见，揭示新的算法偏见形式及其潜在危害。

Method: 开发数据驱动的性别偏见分类法，分析GPT-3.5和电子商务专用LLM生成的描述中的偏见。

Result: 发现多种独特的性别偏见形式，如服装尺寸假设、产品特征刻板印象和说服性语言差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果补充了当前AI危害框架中的排斥性规范、刻板印象和性能差异三类危害，特别针对电子商务场景。

Abstract: While gender bias in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively
studied in many domains, uses of LLMs in e-commerce remain largely unexamined
and may reveal novel forms of algorithmic bias and harm. Our work investigates
this space, developing data-driven taxonomic categories of gender bias in the
context of product description generation, which we situate with respect to
existing general purpose harms taxonomies. We illustrate how AI-generated
product descriptions can uniquely surface gender biases in ways that require
specialized detection and mitigation approaches. Further, we quantitatively
analyze issues corresponding to our taxonomic categories in two models used for
this task -- GPT-3.5 and an e-commerce-specific LLM -- demonstrating that these
forms of bias commonly occur in practice. Our results illuminate unique,
under-explored dimensions of gender bias, such as assumptions about clothing
size, stereotypical bias in which features of a product are advertised, and
differences in the use of persuasive language. These insights contribute to our
understanding of three types of AI harms identified by current frameworks:
exclusionary norms, stereotyping, and performance disparities, particularly for
the context of e-commerce.

### [7] [Are Large Language Models Good Temporal Graph Learners?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05393)
*Shenyang Huang,Ali Parviz,Emma Kondrup,Zachary Yang,Zifeng Ding,Michael Bronstein,Reihaneh Rabbany,Guillaume Rabusseau*

Key words: 大型语言模型,时序图,链接预测,可解释性

TL;DR: TGTalker是一个为大型语言模型设计的新型时序图学习框架，通过利用时序图的近期性偏置提取相关信息，并将其转化为自然语言，同时结合时序邻居作为额外信息进行预测。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注静态图或合成时序图，而如何将大型语言模型应用于真实世界的动态图仍是一个未解决的问题。

Method: TGTalker利用时序图的近期性偏置提取结构信息并转化为自然语言，同时结合时序邻居信息进行预测。

Result: 在五个真实世界网络中，TGTalker的表现与最先进的时序图方法相当，并显著优于TGN和HTGN等流行模型，同时还能为每个预测生成文本解释。

Conclusion: TGTalker不仅具有竞争力的链接预测能力，还为时序链接预测的可解释性开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently driven significant advancements in
Natural Language Processing and various other applications. While a broad range
of literature has explored the graph-reasoning capabilities of LLMs, including
their use of predictors on graphs, the application of LLMs to dynamic graphs --
real world evolving networks -- remains relatively unexplored. Recent work
studies synthetic temporal graphs generated by random graph models, but
applying LLMs to real-world temporal graphs remains an open question. To
address this gap, we introduce Temporal Graph Talker (TGTalker), a novel
temporal graph learning framework designed for LLMs. TGTalker utilizes the
recency bias in temporal graphs to extract relevant structural information,
converted to natural language for LLMs, while leveraging temporal neighbors as
additional information for prediction. TGTalker demonstrates competitive link
prediction capabilities compared to existing Temporal Graph Neural Network
(TGNN) models. Across five real-world networks, TGTalker performs competitively
with state-of-the-art temporal graph methods while consistently outperforming
popular models such as TGN and HTGN. Furthermore, TGTalker generates textual
explanations for each prediction, thus opening up exciting new directions in
explainability and interpretability for temporal link prediction. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/shenyangHuang/TGTalker.

*Ayesha Qamar,Arushi Raghuvanshi,Conal Sathi,Youngseo Son*

Key words: 医疗电话转录, ASR, 伪标签, Auto Review

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Auto Review的系统，通过两阶段后处理流程提高医疗电话转录的准确性，减少人工审核负担。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 医疗电话转录中的噪音和领域术语导致信息提取不准确，影响患者治疗效率。

Method: 采用两阶段系统：第一阶段为Auto Review，第二阶段为后处理流程，结合多ASR替代和伪标签方法。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著提高了转录准确性，提升了Auto Review的效率。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效解决ASR问题，减少人工干预，同时保持高准确性。

Abstract: Automating benefit verification phone calls saves time in healthcare and
helps patients receive treatment faster. It is critical to obtain highly
accurate information in these phone calls, as it can affect a patient's
healthcare journey. Given the noise in phone call transcripts, we have a
two-stage system that involves a post-call review phase for potentially noisy
fields, where human reviewers manually verify the extracted
data$\unicode{x2013}$a labor-intensive task. To automate this stage, we
introduce Auto Review, which significantly reduces manual effort while
maintaining a high bar for accuracy. This system, being highly reliant on call
transcripts, suffers a performance bottleneck due to automatic speech
recognition (ASR) issues. This problem is further exacerbated by the use of
domain-specific jargon in the calls. In this work, we propose a second-stage
postprocessing pipeline for accurate information extraction. We improve
accuracy by using multiple ASR alternatives and a pseudo-labeling approach that
does not require manually corrected transcripts. Experiments with
general-purpose large language models and feature-based model pipelines
demonstrate substantial improvements in the quality of corrected call
transcripts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of Auto Review.

### [9] [Homogeneous Keys, Heterogeneous Values: Exploiting Local KV Cache Asymmetry for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05410)
*Wanyun Cui,Mingwei Xu*

Key words: 大语言模型、KV缓存压缩、上下文扩展、注意力机制、AsymKV

TL;DR: 摘要重点介绍了LLMs中KV缓存压缩的重要性，提出了一种新型框架AsymKV，通过区分键和值的分布特性解决了现有方法的不足，并在实验中表现优异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）中注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了上下文长度的扩展，而KV缓存压缩成为解决这一挑战的关键方法。研究发现键和值在分布上存在不对称性，现有方法未充分利用这一特性。

Method: 提出了AsymKV框架，结合基于本地同质性的键合并和数学证明的无损值压缩技术，无需训练即可高效压缩KV缓存。

Result: AsymKV在多项任务和基准模型中表现优于现有长上下文方法，例如在LLaMA3.1-8B上，LongBench平均得分43.95，显著优于H$_2$O（38.89）。

Conclusion: 通过利用键和值的分布不对称性，AsymKV为长上下文建模提供了一种高效的压缩方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the critical
importance of extending context length, yet the quadratic complexity of
attention mechanisms poses significant challenges for efficient long-context
modeling. KV cache compression has emerged as a key approach to address this
challenge. Through extensive empirical analysis, we reveal a fundamental yet
previously overlooked asymmetry in KV caches: while adjacent keys receive
similar attention weights (local homogeneity), adjacent values demonstrate
distinct heterogeneous distributions. This key-value asymmetry reveals a
critical limitation in existing compression methods that treat keys and values
uniformly. To address the limitation, we propose a training-free compression
framework (AsymKV) that combines homogeneity-based key merging with a
mathematically proven lossless value compression. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AsymKV consistently outperforms existing long-context methods
across various tasks and base models. For example, on LLaMA3.1-8B, AsymKV
achieves an average score of 43.95 on LongBench, surpassing SOTA methods like
H$_2$O (38.89) by a large margin.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型中 4 位量化时存在的激活异常值问题，以提高量化精度。

Method: 采用通道级缩放与 Hadamard 变换结合的 SmoothRot 技术，将极端异常值转化为适合量化的激活值。

Result: 在 LLaMA2 7B、LLaMA3.1 8B 和 Mistral 7B 等模型上的实验表明，SmoothRot 在语言生成和零样本推理任务中将量化模型与 FP16 模型的性能差距缩小了 10-30%，且不增加推理延迟。

Conclusion: SmoothRot 是一种高效的量化方法，显著提升了 4 位量化的精度，适用于大型语言模型。

Abstract: We present SmoothRot, a novel post-training quantization technique to enhance
the efficiency of 4-bit quantization in Large Language Models (LLMs). SmoothRot
addresses the critical challenge of massive activation outliers, by integrating
channel-wise scaling with Hadamard transformations. Our technique effectively
transforms extreme outliers into quantization-friendly activations,
significantly improving quantization accuracy. Experiments conducted on popular
LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot
consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by
approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks,
without introducing additional inference latency. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索用户对Wordle游戏的趣味反应是否能通过计算模型预测。

Method: 从Reddit抓取约80k条用户反应，用GPT-3.5分类，并提取游戏特征预测趣味性。

Result: 游戏特征能弱预测用户的趣味反应，表明Wordle游戏的创意幽默可量化。

Conclusion: 用户对Wordle的趣味反应可通过计算模型部分预测，游戏特征与趣味性相关。

Abstract: We explore automatically predicting which Wordle games Reddit users find
amusing.
  We scrape approximately 80k reactions by Reddit users to Wordle games from
Reddit, classify the reactions as expressing amusement or not using OpenAI's
GPT-3.5 using few-shot prompting, and verify that GPT-3.5's labels roughly
correspond to human labels.
  We then extract features from Wordle games that can predict user amusement.
We demonstrate that the features indeed provide a (weak) signal that predicts
user amusement as predicted by GPT-3.5.
  Our results indicate that user amusement at Wordle games can be predicted
computationally to some extent. We explore which features of the game
contribute to user amusement.
  We find that user amusement is predictable, indicating a measurable aspect of
creativity infused into Wordle games through humor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在动态现实场景中持续学习新知识和技能的能力不足，现有持续学习方法和基准存在局限性。

Method: 提出了基于参数隔离的防止干扰方法和MLLM路由机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能最小化遗忘，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MLLM-CL能有效整合领域知识和功能能力，为持续学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language
understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios
that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While
continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and
methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL,
a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the
former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation
across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID
scenarios with emerging model ability. Methodologically, we propose preventing
catastrophic interference through parameter isolation, along with an MLLM-based
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can
integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal
forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods.

*Niruthiha Selvanayagam*

Key words: 特定语言障碍(SLI), 无监督机器学习, 语言发展轨迹, 诊断标准, 干预策略

TL;DR: 研究利用无监督机器学习技术分析SLI儿童的语言发展轨迹，发现SLI主要表现为语言产出能力下降而非句法复杂性缺陷，挑战了传统分类诊断框架。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统的标准化评估可能忽略SLI儿童的细微发展模式，本研究旨在通过无监督机器学习揭示其自然语言发展轨迹，为早期识别和干预提供依据。

Method: 分析了来自1,163名4-16岁儿童的语言样本，使用PCA和聚类方法评估64个语言特征，区分语言发展轨迹和特征。

Result: 发现两个主要聚类：语言产出高且SLI率低的群体，以及产出有限但句法复杂性高且SLI率高的群体。支持语言能力的连续体模型。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明SLI主要表现为语言产出能力下降，并强调了无监督学习在优化诊断标准和干预策略中的潜力。

Abstract: Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7 percent of
children, presenting as isolated language deficits despite normal cognitive
abilities, sensory systems, and supportive environments. Traditional diagnostic
approaches often rely on standardized assessments, which may overlook subtle
developmental patterns. This study aims to identify natural language
development trajectories in children with and without SLI using unsupervised
machine learning techniques, providing insights for early identification and
targeted interventions. Narrative samples from 1,163 children aged 4-16 years
across three corpora (Conti-Ramsden 4, ENNI, and Gillam) were analyzed using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering. A total of 64 linguistic
features were evaluated to uncover developmental trajectories and distinguish
linguistic profiles. Two primary clusters emerged: (1) high language production
with low SLI prevalence, and (2) limited production but higher syntactic
complexity with higher SLI prevalence. Additionally, boundary cases exhibited
intermediate traits, supporting a continuum model of language abilities.
Findings suggest SLI manifests primarily through reduced production capacity
rather than syntactic complexity deficits. The results challenge categorical
diagnostic frameworks and highlight the potential of unsupervised learning
techniques for refining diagnostic criteria and intervention strategies.

moment now. Many advanced techniques have been introduced and widely accepted,
like retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG), agents, and tools. Tools can
query the database to answer questions from structured data files or perform
groupings or other statistics. This unlocks huge opportunities, such as it can
answer any question, but also poses threats, such as safety, because there is
no control over the commands that are created. We would like to discuss whether
we can create a new method that improves answers based on dataset/database via
some interpretable ML methods, namely enhanced association rules. The advantage
would be if the method can be also used in some safe technique like RAG.
Association rules have a sound history. Since the introduction of CN2 and
aproiri, many enhancements have been made. In parallel, enhanced association
rules have been introduced and evolved over the last 40 years. The general
problem is typically that there are too many rules. There are some techniques
for handling it, but when LLM emerged, it turned out to be the best use case
for the RAG technique for LLMs. We proposed a method that generates a ruleset
based on defined knowledge patterns, then converts rules into text form via a
rule-to-text converter, and includes the result as an RAG into LLM. We compared
this method with ChatGPT (even with using agents) and we have discovered a
significant improvement in answering questions based on the dataset. We have
also tried several strategies how much rules to generate. We found this
improvement interesting. Moreover, it can also be improved in many ways as
future work, like incorporating other patterns, the use of rule mining as an
agent, and many others.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决从电子健康记录中高效准确地回答临床问题的挑战。

Method: 使用大语言模型分两步处理：筛选相关句子（通过少样本提示、自一致性和阈值处理优化）和生成引用支持的简短回答。

Result: 较小的8B模型在筛选相关信息上优于较大的70B模型，且精确的句子选择对高质量回答生成至关重要。

Conclusion: 自一致性与阈值处理可提高句子筛选的可靠性，准确筛选是生成高质量回答的关键。

Abstract: We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical
questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large
language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a
clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported
response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency,
and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which
sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B
model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant
information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for
generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding
helps make these decisions more reliable.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有方法依赖额外身份信息来个性化对齐LLMs，但此方法限制了多样性。SynthesizeMe旨在通过用户交互自动生成用户角色，避免依赖预设信息。

Method: SynthesizeMe首先生成并验证解释用户偏好的推理，然后从中合成用户角色，最后筛选出信息丰富的交互作为个性化提示。

Result: 实验表明，SynthesizeMe使个性化LLM-as-a-judge准确性提高了4.4%，并在新基准PersonalRewardBench上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: SynthesizeMe提供了一种无依赖预设信息的个性化奖励建模方法，有效提升了LLMs的适应性和判断准确性。

Abstract: Recent calls for pluralistic alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs)
encourage adapting models to diverse user preferences. However, most prior work
on personalized reward models heavily rely on additional identity information,
such as demographic details or a predefined set of preference categories. To
this end, we introduce SynthesizeMe, an approach to inducing synthetic user
personas from user interactions for personalized reward modeling. SynthesizeMe
first generates and verifies reasoning to explain user preferences, then
induces synthetic user personas from that reasoning, and finally filters to
informative prior user interactions in order to build personalized prompts for
a particular user. We show that using SynthesizeMe induced prompts improves
personalized LLM-as-a-judge accuracy by 4.4% on Chatbot Arena. Combining
SynthesizeMe derived prompts with a reward model achieves top performance on
PersonalRewardBench: a new curation of user-stratified interactions with
chatbots collected from 854 users of Chatbot Arena and PRISM.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有LLM在模拟人类行为方面表现优异，但缺乏高质量公开数据集来评估其模拟真实用户行为的能力。

Method: 通过在线问卷和自定义浏览器插件收集用户行为数据，构建OPERA数据集（包含用户画像、浏览器观察、细粒度行为及即时理性报告），并在此基础上建立评估基准。

Result: OPERA是首个公开数据集，全面记录了用户行为及其内部逻辑，为评估LLM的预测能力提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该数据集为未来研究LLM作为个性化数字替身的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) accurately simulate the next web action of a
specific user? While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating
``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user
behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality,
publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the
internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce
OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected
from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the
first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser
observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time
rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser
plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the
first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's
next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action,
rationale> history. This dataset lays the groundwork for future research into
LLM agents that aim to act as personalized digital twins for human.

Method: 提出Extended Confounding Filter和Dual Filter两种方法，通过隔离和消除性别相关权重解决性别混杂问题。

Result: 实验表明，消除性别相关权重能减少混杂，但会略微降低痴呆检测性能。

Conclusion: 解决性别混杂可为老年痴呆检测提供更公平的分类器，但需权衡性能。

Abstract: Deep transformer models have been used to detect linguistic anomalies in
patient transcripts for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) screening. While
pre-trained neural language models (LMs) fine-tuned on AD transcripts perform
well, little research has explored the effects of the gender of the speakers
represented by these transcripts. This work addresses gender confounding in
dementia detection and proposes two methods: the $\textit{Extended Confounding
Filter}$ and the $\textit{Dual Filter}$, which isolate and ablate weights
associated with gender. We evaluate these methods on dementia datasets with
first-person narratives from patients with cognitive impairment and healthy
controls. Our results show transformer models tend to overfit to training data
distributions. Disrupting gender-related weights results in a deconfounded
dementia classifier, with the trade-off of slightly reduced dementia detection
performance.

Conclusion: ID-SPAM是一种简单高效的参数高效微调方法，适用于特定任务且计算成本低。

Abstract: The performance of large language models in domain-specific tasks
necessitates fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and technically
challenging. This paper focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using soft
prompting, a promising approach that adapts pre-trained models to downstream

Soft Prompting technique with a self-Attention Mechanism (ID-SPAM) that
generates soft prompts based on the input tokens and attends different tokens
with varying importance. Our method is simple and efficient, keeping the number
of trainable parameters small. We show the merits of the proposed approach
compared to state-of-the-art techniques on various tasks and show the improved
zero shot domain transfer capability.

Conclusion: 研究为自动化内容审核技术的开发部署提供了重要启示，并发布了新数据集。

Abstract: Extremist groups develop complex in-group language, also referred to as
cryptolects, to exclude or mislead outsiders. We investigate the ability of
current language technologies to detect and interpret the cryptolects of two

Result: 合成数据能有效区分事实记忆和逐字序列记忆。

Conclusion: 合成数据有助于研究语言模型的记忆机制，但构建现实虚构数据具有挑战性。

Abstract: When language models are trained on textual data, they acquire both knowledge
about the structure of language as well as knowledge of facts about the world.
At inference time, their knowledge of facts can be leveraged to solve
interesting problems and perform useful knowledge work for users. It is well
known that language models can verbatim memorize long sequences from their
training data. However, it is much less well understood how language models
memorize facts seen during training. In this work, we propose a new dataset to
specifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact
memorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of
synthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well
as question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments
showing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing
apart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in
effectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着LLMs在交互应用（如教育和心理健康）中的重要性增加，研究其在文化背景下的个性表达能力变得尤为重要。

Method: 提出CulturalPersonas基准，包含3000个基于场景的问题，评估三种LLMs在文化和个性表达上的表现。

Result: CulturalPersonas显著减少了Wasserstein距离（20%），并产生更具文化和个性一致性的输出。

Conclusion: CulturalPersonas为LLMs在文化和个性对齐上提供了新方向，有望推动更智能和适应全球的LLMs发展。

Abstract: As LLMs become central to interactive applications, ranging from tutoring to
mental health, the ability to express personality in culturally appropriate
ways is increasingly important. While recent works have explored personality
evaluation of LLMs, they largely overlook the interplay between culture and
personality. To address this, we introduce CulturalPersonas, the first
large-scale benchmark with human validation for evaluating LLMs' personality
expression in culturally grounded, behaviorally rich contexts. Our dataset
spans 3,000 scenario-based questions across six diverse countries, designed to
elicit personality through everyday scenarios rooted in local values. We
evaluate three LLMs, using both multiple-choice and open-ended response
formats. Our results show that CulturalPersonas improves alignment with
country-specific human personality distributions (over a 20% reduction in
Wasserstein distance across models and countries) and elicits more expressive,
culturally coherent outputs compared to existing benchmarks. CulturalPersonas
surfaces meaningful modulated trait outputs in response to culturally grounded
prompts, offering new directions for aligning LLMs to global norms of behavior.
By bridging personality expression and cultural nuance, we envision that
CulturalPersonas will pave the way for more socially intelligent and globally
adaptive LLMs.

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有ECI模型依赖大规模标注数据，而LLMs在零样本ECI中易产生虚假因果联系，MEFA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 将因果关系推理分解为3个主任务和3个辅助任务，通过设计的提示引导LLMs生成响应，并量化子任务输出，利用模糊聚合整合证据进行评分和判定。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MEFA的F1得分比次优无监督基线高6.2%，精度高9.3%，显著减少幻觉错误。

Conclusion: 任务分解和模糊聚合有效提升零样本ECI性能，减少错误因果判断。

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) aims to detect causal relationships
between events in textual contexts. Existing ECI models predominantly rely on
supervised methodologies, suffering from dependence on large-scale annotated
data. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) enable zero-shot ECI, they are
prone to causal hallucination-erroneously establishing spurious causal links.
To address these challenges, we propose MEFA, a novel zero-shot framework based
on Multi-source Evidence Fuzzy Aggregation. First, we decompose causality
reasoning into three main tasks (temporality determination, necessity analysis,
and sufficiency verification) complemented by three auxiliary tasks. Second,
leveraging meticulously designed prompts, we guide LLMs to generate uncertain
responses and deterministic outputs. Finally, we quantify LLM's responses of
sub-tasks and employ fuzzy aggregation to integrate these evidence for
causality scoring and causality determination. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks demonstrate that MEFA outperforms second-best unsupervised baselines
by 6.2% in F1-score and 9.3% in precision, while significantly reducing
hallucination-induced errors. In-depth analysis verify the effectiveness of
task decomposition and the superiority of fuzzy aggregation.

Method: 提出对应原则，通过土耳其语的不连续从句案例展示统一表示方法，并结合三种语法的基本原则进行理论整合。

Conclusion: 该研究为语法形式主义的统一表示提供了新思路，对句法分析和计算语言学具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper advances a unified representation of linguistic structure for
three grammar formalisms, namely, Phrase Structure Grammar (PSG), Dependency
Grammar (DG) and Categorial Grammar (CG) from the perspective of syntactic and
computational complexity considerations. The correspondence principle is
proposed to enable a unified representation of the representational principles
from PSG, DG, and CG. To that end, the paper first illustrates a series of
steps in achieving a unified representation for a discontinuous subordinate
clause from Turkish as an illustrative case. This affords a new way of
approaching discontinuity in natural language from a theoretical point of view
that unites and integrates the basic tenets of PSG, DG, and CG, with
significant consequences for syntactic analysis. Then this paper demonstrates
that a unified representation can simplify computational complexity with
regards to the neurocognitive representation and processing of both continuous
and discontinuous sentences vis-\`a-vis the basic principles of PSG, DG, and
CG.

Conclusion: GraphRAG在特定场景下优于传统RAG，研究结果为其实践应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. It
leverages graphs to model the hierarchical structure between specific concepts,
enabling more coherent and effective knowledge retrieval for accurate
reasoning.Despite its conceptual promise, recent studies report that GraphRAG
frequently underperforms vanilla RAG on many real-world tasks. This raises a
critical question: Is GraphRAG really effective, and in which scenarios do
graph structures provide measurable benefits for RAG systems? To address this,
we propose GraphRAG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
GraphRAG models onboth hierarchical knowledge retrieval and deep contextual
reasoning. GraphRAG-Bench features a comprehensive dataset with tasks of
increasing difficulty, coveringfact retrieval, complex reasoning, contextual
summarization, and creative generation, and a systematic evaluation across the
entire pipeline, from graph constructionand knowledge retrieval to final
generation. Leveraging this novel benchmark, we systematically investigate the
conditions when GraphRAG surpasses traditional RAG and the underlying reasons
for its success, offering guidelines for its practical application. All related
resources and analyses are collected for the community at

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有LLM的知识蒸馏方法在学生模型训练过程中容易导致分布偏移，引发灾难性遗忘、模式崩溃等问题。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了POCL框架。

Method: POCL框架包括两个核心组件：1）难度测量器对训练样本从易到难排序和分组；2）训练调度器按固定间隔逐步引入样本，并使用逐渐升温的损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，POCL在各种白盒KD方法和模型家族中，均能显著提升学生模型的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结构化训练数据，POCL有效增强了蒸馏LLM的稳定性和性能，为KD过程的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by
transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model,
reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance.
However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts
in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as
catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning
framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload"
(POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD
approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two
core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training
samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally
introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while
applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting
with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the
approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive
experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL
consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across
various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our
work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to
enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在关系深度学习（RDL）中的应用尚未充分探索，传统文本序列化方法易丢失关键关系结构且效率低下。

Method: Rel-LLM采用基于图神经网络（GNN）的编码器生成结构化关系提示，通过反规范化过程将关系数据转化为LLM可处理的提示。

Result: 实验表明，Rel-LLM在关键RDL任务中表现优于现有方法，提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: Rel-LLM为LLMs与结构化数据源的集成提供了一种新颖且高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL)
remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational
links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into
flat text documents. Still, this text-based serialization disregards critical
relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM
context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that utilizes a
graph neural network (GNN)- based encoder to generate structured relational
prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.
Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves
the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to
effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically,
the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature
representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal
dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts
using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over
relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘技术主要关注孤立事实的显式删除，忽略了潜在推理依赖和知识的非确定性，可能导致遗忘不彻底。

Method: 研究提出一个基于知识图谱和置信度的框架，利用LLM评委设计推理评估协议，校准人类评估以确保可信度。

Result: 实验验证了新框架的严谨性，发现现有评估方法可能高估遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 新框架为知识遗忘提供了更现实和严格的评估标准，揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in
large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus
on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential
dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs.
Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through
correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge
unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit
structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as
knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an
inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these
judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning
success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated
against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability.
Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our
framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning
performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies
tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在鲁棒性、扩展性和性能上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs的时序推理任务设定了新基准。

Abstract: Temporal tabular question answering presents a significant challenge for
Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring robust reasoning over structured data,
which is a task where traditional prompting methods often fall short. These
methods face challenges such as memorization, sensitivity to table size, and
reduced performance on complex queries. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce TempTabQA-C, a synthetic dataset designed for systematic and
controlled evaluations, alongside a symbolic intermediate representation that
transforms tables into database schemas. This structured approach allows LLMs
to generate and execute SQL queries, enhancing generalization and mitigating
biases. By incorporating adaptive few-shot prompting with contextually tailored
examples, our method achieves superior robustness, scalability, and
performance. Experimental results consistently highlight improvements across
key challenges, setting a new benchmark for robust temporal reasoning with
LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法在长文本生成中存在数据饱和和学习能力受限的问题，需探索更高效的训练框架。

Method: 提出基于自适应课程的强化学习框架，包括边际感知数据选择、成对比较奖励和动态参考调度。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了7B规模模型的长文本生成能力，并展示了良好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Writing-RL为长文本生成提供了新思路，并可能在长上下文训练中具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled strong
performance in long-form writing, yet existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
approaches suffer from limitations such as data saturation and restricted
learning capacity bounded by teacher signals. In this work, we present
Writing-RL: an Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework to advance
long-form writing capabilities beyond SFT. The framework consists of three key
components: Margin-aware Data Selection strategy that prioritizes samples with
high learning potential, Pairwise Comparison Reward mechanism that provides
discriminative learning signals in the absence of verifiable rewards, and
Dynamic Reference Scheduling approach, which plays a particularly critical role
by adaptively adjusting task difficulty based on evolving model performance.
Experiments on 7B-scale writer models show that our RL framework largely
improves long-form writing performance over strong SFT baselines. Furthermore,
we observe that models trained with long-output RL generalize surprisingly well
to long-input reasoning tasks, potentially offering a promising perspective for
rethinking long-context training.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 针对现实问题（如医疗保健）需要多模态信息（知识图谱、文本、分子结构）的检索和推理，现有检索增强生成（RAG）方法仅关注文本，因此提出BioMol-MQA以填补这一空白。

Method: 构建一个多模态知识图谱（KG），结合文本和分子结构，并设计挑战性问题以测试语言模型的检索和推理能力。

Result: 现有大型语言模型在这类问题上表现不佳，仅在有背景数据时表现良好。

Conclusion: 多模态信息检索和推理是重要挑战，需开发更强的RAG框架。

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to
retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world
problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in
various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex
molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality
domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to
generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present
BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is
composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and
molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions
that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over
multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs
struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary
background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在事件排序和持续时间估计等任务上表现出色，但其对实际时间流逝的感知能力尚未被研究。论文旨在探索LLMs是否能够感知时间并据此调整决策。

Method: 通过三项实验验证LLMs的时间感知能力：1) Token-Time假设，验证LLMs能将离散的token计数映射到连续时间；2) 在问答任务中，LLMs根据用户紧迫性调整回答长度；3) BombRush交互导航任务，测试LLMs在动态环境中随时间压力调整行为。

Result: 研究发现LLMs具有一定的时间感知能力，能够连接离散的语言token和连续的实际时间，但这种能力因模型大小和推理能力而异。

Conclusion: 该研究为增强LLMs在时间敏感应用中的时间感知能力奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at temporal reasoning tasks like
event ordering and duration estimation, their ability to perceive the actual
passage of time remains unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs perceive the
passage of time and adapt their decision-making accordingly through three
complementary experiments. First, we introduce the Token-Time Hypothesis,
positing that LLMs can map discrete token counts to continuous wall-clock time,
and validate this through a dialogue duration judgment task. Second, we
demonstrate that LLMs could use this awareness to adapt their response length
while maintaining accuracy when users express urgency in question answering
tasks. Finally, we develop BombRush, an interactive navigation challenge that
examines how LLMs modify behavior under progressive time pressure in dynamic
environments. Our findings indicate that LLMs possess certain awareness of time
passage, enabling them to bridge discrete linguistic tokens and continuous
physical time, though this capability varies with model size and reasoning
abilities. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing
temporal awareness in LLMs for time-sensitive applications.

Result: 在WiKiTQ和TabFact数据集上的实验表明，MAPLE显著优于现有方法，并在多个LLM骨干上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过多智能体协作和长期记忆管理，有效提升了表格问答任务的推理能力。

Abstract: Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that
current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack
error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting
sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE
(Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that
mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a
feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the
ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a
Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver
managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on
WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

Conclusion: FinanceReasoning为评估和改进大型推理模型在领域特定复杂推理任务中的表现提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical
reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four
public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions
and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate
assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly
surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted
functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through
refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge:
Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical
reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with
PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical
precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can
effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，不同语言在模型推理能力上存在不平等，并揭示了奖励塑造、数据难度和预训练先验在跨语言推理中的作用。

Abstract: We identify \textbf{Cross-lingual Collapse}, a systematic drift in which the
chain-of-thought (CoT) of a multilingual language model reverts to its dominant
pre-training language even when the prompt is expressed in a different
language. Recent large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning with
verifiable reward (RLVR) have achieved strong logical reasoning performances by
exposing their intermediate reasoning traces, giving rise to large reasoning
models (LRMs). However, the mechanism behind multilingual reasoning in LRMs is
not yet fully explored. To investigate the issue, we fine-tune multilingual
LRMs with Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on translated versions of
the GSM$8$K and SimpleRL-Zoo datasets in three different languages: Chinese,
Korean, and Ukrainian. During training, we monitor both task accuracy and
language consistency of the reasoning chains. Our experiments reveal three key
findings: (i) GRPO rapidly amplifies pre-training language imbalances, leading
to the erosion of low-resource languages within just a few hundred updates;
(ii) language consistency reward mitigates this drift but does so at the
expense of an almost 5 - 10 pp drop in accuracy. and (iii) the resulting
language collapse is severely damaging and largely irreversible, as subsequent
fine-tuning struggles to steer the model back toward its original
target-language reasoning capabilities. Together, these findings point to a
remarkable conclusion: \textit{not all languages are trained equally for
reasoning}. Furthermore, our paper sheds light on the roles of reward shaping,
data difficulty, and pre-training priors in eliciting multilingual reasoning.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，成本降低86.85%，性能保持或超过基线。

Conclusion: R2-Reasoner为成本效益和自适应LLM推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning has proven essential for enhancing the problem-solving
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into
intermediate steps, either explicitly or implicitly. Extending the reasoning
chain at test time through deeper thought processes or broader exploration, can
furthur improve performance, but often incurs substantial costs due to the
explosion in token usage. Yet, many reasoning steps are relatively simple and
can be handled by more efficient smaller-scale language models (SLMs). This
motivates hybrid approaches that allocate subtasks across models of varying
capacities. However, realizing such collaboration requires accurate task
decomposition and difficulty-aware subtask allocation, which is challenging. To
address this, we propose R2-Reasoner, a novel framework that enables
collaborative reasoning across heterogeneous LLMs by dynamically routing
sub-tasks based on estimated complexity. At the core of our framework is a
Reinforced Model Router, composed of a task decomposer and a subtask allocator.
The task decomposer segments complex input queries into logically ordered
subtasks, while the subtask allocator assigns each subtask to the most
appropriate model, ranging from lightweight SLMs to powerful LLMs, balancing
accuracy and efficiency. To train this router, we introduce a staged pipeline
that combines supervised fine-tuning on task-specific datasets with Group
Relative Policy Optimization algorithm, enabling self-supervised refinement
through iterative reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across four
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that R2-Reasoner reduces API costs by 86.85%
while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy. Our framework paves the way
for more cost-effective and adaptive LLM reasoning. The code is open-source at

Method: MisMitiFact框架利用轻量化细化模型，基于公开事实核查数据训练，生成针对LLM输出的关键元素（如数字、实体、主题）的细化反馈。

Result: 实验表明，MisMitiFact生成的对抗性回应质量与LLM自反馈相当，但反馈生成吞吐量提升约5倍。

Conclusion: MisMitiFact为高效、大规模虚假信息缓解提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Fake news and misinformation poses a significant threat to society, making
efficient mitigation essential. However, manual fact-checking is costly and
lacks scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise in automating
counter-response generation to mitigate misinformation, but a critical
challenge lies in their tendency to hallucinate non-factual information.
Existing models mainly rely on LLM self-feedback to reduce hallucination, but
this approach is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose
MisMitiFact, Misinformation Mitigation grounded in Facts, an efficient
framework for generating fact-grounded counter-responses at scale. MisMitiFact
generates simple critique feedback to refine LLM outputs, ensuring responses
are grounded in evidence. We develop lightweight, fine-grained critique models
trained on data sourced from readily available fact-checking sites to identify
and correct errors in key elements such as numerals, entities, and topics in
LLM generations. Experiments show that MisMitiFact generates counter-responses
of comparable quality to LLMs' self-feedback while using significantly smaller
critique models. Importantly, it achieves ~5x increase in feedback generation
throughput, making it highly suitable for cost-effective, large-scale
misinformation mitigation. Code and LLM prompt templates are at

Conclusion: 异构MoA能有效提升LLM在下游任务中的知识迁移能力。

Abstract: Recent studies integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) to further enhance the performance of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods in Large Language Model (LLM) applications. Existing methods
employ \emph{homogeneous} MoE-LoRA architectures composed of LoRA experts with
either similar or identical structures and capacities. However, these
approaches often suffer from representation collapse and expert load imbalance,
which negatively impact the potential of LLMs. To address these challenges, we
propose a \emph{heterogeneous} \textbf{Mixture-of-Adapters (MoA)} approach.
This method dynamically integrates PEFT adapter experts with diverse
structures, leveraging their complementary representational capabilities to
foster expert specialization, thereby enhancing the effective transfer of
pre-trained knowledge to downstream tasks. MoA supports two variants:
\textbf{(i)} \textit{Soft MoA} achieves fine-grained integration by performing
a weighted fusion of all expert outputs; \textbf{(ii)} \textit{Sparse MoA}
activates adapter experts sparsely based on their contribution, achieving this
with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that
heterogeneous MoA outperforms homogeneous MoE-LoRA methods in both performance
and parameter efficiency. Our project is available at

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) often struggle to dynamically adapt their

a novel tri-mode thinking system. DynamicMind empowers LLMs to autonomously
select between Fast, Normal, and Slow thinking modes for zero-shot question

framework's core innovations include: (1) expanding the established
dual-process framework of fast and slow thinking into a tri-mode thinking
system involving a normal thinking mode to preserve the intrinsic capabilities
of LLM; (2) proposing the Thinking Density metric, which aligns computational
resource allocation with problem complexity; and (3) developing the Thinking
Mode Capacity (TMC) dataset and a lightweight Mind Router to predict the
optimal thinking mode. Extensive experiments across diverse mathematical,

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 情感支持对话中模糊的意图可能导致不当策略，需明确意图以优化支持效果。

Method: 提出IntentionESC框架，定义意图、关键情感状态及策略映射；设计ICECoT机制模仿人类推理；开发自动化标注管道与评估方案。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，数据与代码已开源。

Conclusion: 明确意图的框架显著提升情感支持对话效果，ICECoT机制增强LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: In emotional support conversations, unclear intentions can lead supporters to
employ inappropriate strategies, inadvertently imposing their expectations or
solutions on the seeker. Clearly defined intentions are essential for guiding
both the supporter's motivations and the overall emotional support process. In
this paper, we propose the Intention-centered Emotional Support Conversation
(IntentionESC) framework, which defines the possible intentions of supporters
in emotional support conversations, identifies key emotional state aspects for
inferring these intentions, and maps them to appropriate support strategies.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generating, they fundamentally
operate as probabilistic models trained on extensive datasets, lacking a true
understanding of human thought processes and intentions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Intention Centric Chain-of-Thought (ICECoT)
mechanism. ICECoT enables LLMs to mimic human reasoning by analyzing emotional
states, inferring intentions, and selecting suitable support strategies,
thereby generating more effective emotional support responses. To train the
model with ICECoT and integrate expert knowledge, we design an automated
annotation pipeline that produces high-quality training data. Furthermore, we
develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess emotional support efficacy
and conduct extensive experiments to validate our framework. Our data and code
are available at https://github.com/43zxj/IntentionESC_ICECoT.

Key words: 数学应用题生成，大型语言模型，提示策略，人类反馈

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成数学应用题（MWP）的系统，无需额外输入，仅需指定数量、年级和题型，可高效生成高质量问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决传统生成数学应用题耗时且现有深度学习技术需要额外输入的问题，提高生成效率和多样性。

Method: 采用多种LLM、提示策略、多样性增强技术及人类反馈改进LLM性能。

Result: 生成的问题质量高，拼写和语法问题少，但在年级和题型匹配上仍有不足。

Conclusion: LLM能高效生成高质量MWP，但需进一步改进以更好满足特定年级和题型需求。

Abstract: Mathematics is often perceived as a complex subject by students, leading to
high failure rates in exams. To improve Mathematics skills, it is important to
provide sample questions for students to practice problem-solving. Manually
creating Math Word Problems (MWPs) is time consuming for tutors, because they
have to type in natural language while adhering to grammar and spelling rules
of the language. Existing Deep Learning techniques for MWP generation either
require a tutor to provide the initial portion of the MWP, and/or additional
information such as an equation. In this paper, we present an MWP generation
system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that overcome the need for
additional input - the only input to our system is the number of MWPs needed,
the grade and the type of question (e.g. addition, subtraction). Unlike the
existing LLM-based solutions for MWP generation, we carried out an extensive
set of experiments involving different LLMs, prompting strategies, techniques
to improve the diversity of questions, as well as techniques that employ human
feedback to improve LLM performance. Human and automated evaluations confirmed
that the generated MWPs are high in quality, with minimal spelling and grammar
issues. However, LLMs still struggle to generate questions that adhere to the
specified grade and question type requirements.

Key words: 心理理论, 大型语言模型, 推理时方法, SoO前缀, 泛化能力

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型在心理理论（ToM）方面尚未达到人类水平，现有方法多针对特定场景。本文提出了一种新的推理时方法Shoes-of-Others前缀，适应更广场景，提升ToM表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有方法多针对特定场景（世界状态变化），而大型语言模型在ToM上的泛化能力不足，因此需要一种更通用的方法。

Method: 提出Shoes-of-Others（SoO）前缀方法，通过在输出开头添加``Let's put ourselves in A's shoes.''来提升ToM表现，适用于更广泛的场景。

Result: 在两种对话和叙述场景的基准测试中，SoO前缀方法显著提升了5类心理状态的ToM表现。

Conclusion: SoO前缀方法通过激发真实思考，有效提升模型在ToM任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Theory of Mind (ToM) in large language models
(LLMs) has not reached human-level performance yet. Since fine-tuning LLMs on
ToM datasets often degrades their generalization, several inference-time
methods have been proposed to enhance ToM in LLMs. However, existing
inference-time methods for ToM are specialized for inferring beliefs from
contexts involving changes in the world state. In this study, we present a new
inference-time method for ToM, Shoes-of-Others (SoO) prefixing, which makes
fewer assumptions about contexts and is applicable to broader scenarios. SoO
prefixing simply specifies the beginning of LLM outputs with ``Let's put
ourselves in A's shoes.'', where A denotes the target character's name. We
evaluate SoO prefixing on two benchmarks that assess ToM in conversational and
narrative contexts without changes in the world state and find that it
consistently improves ToM across five categories of mental states. Our analysis
suggests that SoO prefixing elicits faithful thoughts, thereby improving the
ToM performance.

Abstract: Our contribution to the SemEval 2025 shared task 10, subtask 1 on entity
framing, tackles the challenge of providing the necessary segments from longer

approach and the XLM-RoBERTa language model is on par with, or outperforms,
Supervised Fine-Tuning with larger generative language models.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 文本匿名化在保护隐私和保留信息之间存在复杂权衡，目前缺乏统一的评估基准。

Method: 提出了Tau-Eval框架，通过隐私和效用任务敏感性来评估匿名化方法。

Result: Tau-Eval作为开源工具（Python库）发布，提供了代码、文档和教程。

Conclusion: Tau-Eval填补了匿名化方法评估的空白，为解决权衡问题提供标准化工具。

Abstract: Text anonymization is the process of removing or obfuscating information from
textual data to protect the privacy of individuals. This process inherently
involves a complex trade-off between privacy protection and information
preservation, where stringent anonymization methods can significantly impact
the text's utility for downstream applications. Evaluating the effectiveness of
text anonymization proves challenging from both privacy and utility
perspectives, as there is no universal benchmark that can comprehensively
assess anonymization techniques across diverse, and sometimes contradictory
contexts. We present Tau-Eval, an open-source framework for benchmarking text
anonymization methods through the lens of privacy and utility task sensitivity.

Method: 结合OCR、自动文本提取和人工验证构建数据集，涵盖多领域和难度，并通过模型对比和跨语言实验分析性能差异。

Result: 模型在国际问题上表现更优（80-95%），而罗马尼亚本土文化问题准确率较低（50-75%），跨语言测试进一步验证了文化背景的影响。

Conclusion: 文化背景和数据源对LLM性能影响显著，研究为构建文化敏感的多语言NLP系统提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate varying performance across languages
and cultural contexts. This study introduces a novel, culturally-rich,
multilingual dataset derived from video recordings of the Romanian game show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" (Vrei s\u{a} fii Milionar?). We employed an
innovative process combining optical character recognition (OCR), automated
text extraction, and manual verification to collect question-answer pairs,
enriching them with metadata including question domain (e.g., biology,
history), cultural relevance (Romanian-specific vs. international), and
difficulty. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs, including Romanian-adapted
models, on this dataset revealed significant performance disparities: models
consistently achieve higher accuracy (80-95%) on international questions
compared to Romanian-specific cultural questions (50-75%). We further
investigate these differences through experiments involving machine translation
of Romanian questions into English and cross-lingual tests using a comparable
dataset in French. Our findings underscore the impact of cultural context and
data source on LLM performance and offer practical insights for building
robust, culturally-aware multilingual NLP systems, especially in educational
domains. The dataset is publicly available at Hugging Face.

Motivation: 研究CoT技术在不同任务中效果不一致的底层机制，并提出一种动态选择技术以提高效率。

Method: 提出基于令牌概率分布的指标，结合逻辑回归模型，设计动态CoT方法。

Result: 评估指标准确率达89.2%，动态CoT减少35%以上令牌消耗且保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 揭示了CoT推理的底层机制，并提供高效部署框架。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique has proven effective in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks.
However, the performance gains are inconsistent across different tasks, and the
underlying mechanism remains a long-standing research question. In this work,
we make a preliminary observation that the monotonicity of token probability
distributions may be correlated with the gains achieved through CoT reasoning.
Leveraging this insight, we propose two indicators based on the token
probability distribution to assess CoT effectiveness across different tasks. By
combining instance-level indicators with logistic regression model, we
introduce Dynamic CoT, a method that dynamically select between CoT and direct
answer. Furthermore, we extend Dynamic CoT to closed-source models by
transferring decision strategies learned from open-source models. Our
indicators for assessing CoT effectiveness achieve an accuracy of 89.2\%, and
Dynamic CoT reduces token consumption by more than 35\% while maintaining high
accuracy. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on the underlying
mechanisms of CoT reasoning and provides a framework for its more efficient
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有LLMs在递归推理能力上有限，尤其是在缺乏专家标注数据的情况下，需要一种新方法来提升其性能。

Method: 提出了AvR方法，通过整合批评和改进动作的细化过程，利用可微学习技术优化refinement-aware rewards。

Result: 实验结果显示AvR显著优于传统偏好优化方法，仅用3k合成样本就将LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型在AlpacaEval 2.0上的胜率提升超过20%。

Conclusion: AvR通过长式CoT和细化过程有效提升了LLMs的递归推理能力，展现了显著性能优势。

Abstract: The OpenAI o1-series models have demonstrated that leveraging long-form Chain
of Thought (CoT) can substantially enhance performance. However, the recursive
thinking capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain limited,
particularly in the absence of expert-curated data for distillation. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{AvR}: \textbf{Alignment via Refinement}, a novel
method aimed at unlocking the potential of LLMs for recursive reasoning through
long-form CoT. AvR introduces a refinement process that integrates criticism
and improvement actions, guided by differentiable learning techniques to
optimize \textbf{refinement-aware rewards}. As a result, the synthesized
multi-round data can be organized as a long refinement thought, further
enabling test-time scaling. Experimental results show that AvR significantly
outperforms conventional preference optimization methods. Notably, with only 3k
synthetic samples, our method boosts the performance of the LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct
model by over 20\% in win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0. Our code is available at
Github (https://github.com/Banner-Z/AvR.git).

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有代理搜索方法存在三大局限性：优化工作流但忽视功能组件、评估成本高、搜索效率低，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入分层搜索空间联合建模工作流和功能组件，提出预测性能模型，并使用基于不确定性的分层蒙特卡洛树搜索策略。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，平均性能提升8.34%，且搜索进度更快。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了代理设计的效率和性能，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities
across diverse domains. However, designing high-performing agentic systems
remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major
limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while
under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and
tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be
fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search
space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these
challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models
agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic
system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a
predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system
and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the
search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on
seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our
method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art
baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement
trajectories. Code repo is available at

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决语言模型在遇到参数知识与上下文输入冲突时产生的信息不一致或幻觉问题。

Method: 采用SR-DCR框架，通过引入一个缺乏上下文的批评者与一个基于上下文的辩护者之间的不对称辩论，并由一个评判模型评估辩论结果，最终结合判决与模型置信度选择答案。

Result: 在ClashEval基准测试中，SR-DCR显著提高了对误导性上下文的鲁棒性，同时保持了在可信输入上的准确性，且在计算开销最小的情况下优于传统辩论和仅依赖置信度的基线方法。

Conclusion: SR-DCR是一种有效且轻量的方法，能够提高语言模型在上下文冲突中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models frequently encounter conflicts between their parametric
knowledge and contextual input, often resulting in factual inconsistencies or
hallucinations. We propose Self-Reflective Debate for Contextual Reliability
(SR-DCR), a lightweight framework that integrates token-level self-confidence
with an asymmetric multi-agent debate to adjudicate such conflicts. A critic,
deprived of context, challenges a defender who argues from the given passage; a
judge model evaluates the debate and determines the context's reliability. The
final answer is selected by combining the verdict with model confidence.
Experiments on the ClashEval benchmark demonstrate that SR-DCR consistently
enhances robustness to misleading context while maintaining accuracy on
trustworthy inputs, outperforming both classical debate and confidence-only
baselines with minimal computational overhead. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有ICL方法因频繁从大规模数据中检索而计算成本高，需要高效解决方案。

Result: 实验显示FEEDER减少20%以上训练数据，保持性能，兼容多种下游策略。

Conclusion: FEEDER高效且兼容性强，显著提升ICL和微调效率。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) delivers strong
few-shot performance by choosing few-shot demonstrations from the entire
training data. However, existing ICL methods, which rely on similarity or
diversity scores to choose demonstrations, incur high computational costs due
to repeatedly retrieval from large-scale datasets for each query. To this end,
we propose FEEDER (FEw yet Essential Demonstration prE-selectoR), a novel
pre-selection framework that identifies a representative subset of
demonstrations containing the most representative examples in the training
data, tailored to specific LLMs. To construct this subset, we introduce the
"sufficiency" and "necessity" metrics in the pre-selection stage and design a
tree-based algorithm to identify representative examples efficiently. Once
pre-selected, this representative subset can effectively replace the full
training data, improving efficiency while maintaining comparable performance in
ICL. Additionally, our pre-selected subset also benefits fine-tuning LLMs,
where we introduce a bi-level optimization method that enhances training
efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experiments with LLMs ranging from
300M to 8B parameters show that FEEDER can reduce training data size by over
20% while maintaining performance and seamlessly integrating with various
downstream demonstration selection strategies in ICL.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型在解决数学问题方面表现优异，但作为多模态自动定理证明器的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了MATP-BENCH基准，包含1056个多模态定理问题，覆盖高数、大学和竞赛数学，并支持多种定理证明框架（如Lean 4、Coq和Isabelle）。

Result: 现有方法仅能解决少量MATP-BENCH问题，表明该基准为自动定理证明研究提出了新的挑战。

Conclusion: MATP-BENCH为研究多模态自动定理证明提供了重要工具，揭示了MLLMs在复杂视觉与符号推理集成中的不足。

Abstract: Numerous theorems, such as those in geometry, are often presented in
multimodal forms (e.g., diagrams). Humans benefit from visual reasoning in such
settings, using diagrams to gain intuition and guide the proof process. Modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in solving a wide range of mathematical problems. However, the
potential of MLLMs as Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs), specifically in the
multimodal domain, remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the
Multimodal Automated Theorem Proving benchmark (MATP-BENCH), a new Multimodal,
Multi-level, and Multi-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in this
role as multimodal automated theorem provers. MATP-BENCH consists of 1056
multimodal theorems drawn from high school, university, and competition-level
mathematics. All these multimodal problems are accompanied by formalizations in
Lean 4, Coq and Isabelle, thus making the benchmark compatible with a wide
range of theorem-proving frameworks. MATP-BENCH requires models to integrate
sophisticated visual understanding with mastery of a broad spectrum of
mathematical knowledge and rigorous symbolic reasoning to generate formal
proofs. We use MATP-BENCH to evaluate a variety of advanced multimodal language
models. Existing methods can only solve a limited number of the MATP-BENCH
problems, indicating that this benchmark poses an open challenge for research
on automated theorem proving.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖无法公开访问的模型内部信息，CatShift旨在解决这一限制，提供无需依赖模型内部信号的检测方法。

Method: 通过微调模型在可疑数据集上，观察其输出变化，与已知非训练集的验证集对比，统计确定数据集是否曾被用于训练。

Result: 实验证明CatShift在开源和API模型上均有效，适用于无法访问模型内部信息的场景。

Conclusion: CatShift为保护专有数据提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
by excelling at interpreting, reasoning about, and generating human language.
However, their reliance on large-scale, often proprietary datasets poses a
critical challenge: unauthorized usage of such data can lead to copyright
infringement and significant financial harm. Existing dataset-inference methods
typically depend on log probabilities to detect suspicious training material,
yet many leading LLMs have begun withholding or obfuscating these signals. This
reality underscores the pressing need for label-only approaches capable of
identifying dataset membership without relying on internal model logits.
  We address this gap by introducing CatShift, a label-only dataset-inference
framework that capitalizes on catastrophic forgetting: the tendency of an LLM
to overwrite previously learned knowledge when exposed to new data. If a
suspicious dataset was previously seen by the model, fine-tuning on a portion
of it triggers a pronounced post-tuning shift in the model's outputs;
conversely, truly novel data elicits more modest changes. By comparing the
model's output shifts for a suspicious dataset against those for a known
non-member validation set, we statistically determine whether the suspicious
set is likely to have been part of the model's original training corpus.
Extensive experiments on both open-source and API-based LLMs validate
CatShift's effectiveness in logit-inaccessible settings, offering a robust and
practical solution for safeguarding proprietary data.

Result: 实验表明，该方法可提取高达56.57%的受害者独有PII，其中"地址"、"生日"和"姓名"最易受攻击。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更强防御策略的紧迫性，并为联邦学习的隐私保护研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of large language models (FedLLMs) presents a promising
approach for achieving strong model performance while preserving data privacy
in sensitive domains. However, the inherent memorization ability of LLMs makes
them vulnerable to training data extraction attacks. To investigate this risk,
we introduce simple yet effective extraction attack algorithms specifically
designed for FedLLMs. In contrast to prior "verbatim" extraction attacks, which
assume access to fragments from all training data, our approach operates under
a more realistic threat model, where the attacker only has access to a single
client's data and aims to extract previously unseen personally identifiable
information (PII) from other clients. This requires leveraging contextual
prefixes held by the attacker to generalize across clients. To evaluate the
effectiveness of our approaches, we propose two rigorous metrics-coverage rate
and efficiency-and extend a real-world legal dataset with PII annotations
aligned with CPIS, GDPR, and CCPA standards, achieving 89.9% human-verified
precision. Experimental results show that our method can extract up to 56.57%
of victim-exclusive PII, with "Address," "Birthday," and "Name" being the most
vulnerable categories. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust
defense strategies and contribute a new benchmark and evaluation framework for
future research in privacy-preserving federated learning.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着LLM生成代码的普及，如何检测这些代码对安全、知识产权和学术诚信提出了挑战。本文旨在通过任务级别的条件概率分布改进检测方法。

Method: 提出ATC方法，近似原始任务提示并计算代码片段的条件熵，无需访问生成器或原始任务提示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到了最佳性能，并支持多种编程语言（Python、CPP、Java）。

Conclusion: 任务级别的条件是检测LLM生成代码的关键，ATC方法在实用性和效果上均有显著优势。

Abstract: Detecting Large Language Model (LLM)-generated code is a growing challenge
with implications for security, intellectual property, and academic integrity.
We investigate the role of conditional probability distributions in improving
zero-shot LLM-generated code detection, when considering both the code and the
corresponding task prompt that generated it. Our key insight is that when
evaluating the probability distribution of code tokens using an LLM, there is
little difference between LLM-generated and human-written code. However,
conditioning on the task reveals notable differences. This contrasts with
natural language text, where differences exist even in the unconditional
distributions. Leveraging this, we propose a novel zero-shot detection approach
that approximates the original task used to generate a given code snippet and
then evaluates token-level entropy under the approximated task conditioning
(ATC). We further provide a mathematical intuition, contextualizing our method
relative to previous approaches. ATC requires neither access to the generator
LLM nor the original task prompts, making it practical for real-world
applications. To the best of our knowledge, it achieves state-of-the-art
results across benchmarks and generalizes across programming languages,
including Python, CPP, and Java. Our findings highlight the importance of
task-level conditioning for LLM-generated code detection. The supplementary
materials and code are available at https://github.com/maorash/ATC, including
the dataset gathering implementation, to foster further research in this area.

Key words: MIRIAD, LLMs, RAG, medical QA, knowledge grounding

TL;DR: 总结了MIRIAD这一大规模医疗QA对数据库，通过半自动化流程生成和整理，提升了LLMs在医疗QA中的准确性和抗幻觉能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前LLMs在医疗领域生成内容的不准确性和现有RAG技术依赖非结构化文本的问题，需要更高质量的知识库支持。

Method: 开发了MIRIAD，包含5,821,948个医疗QA对，通过LLM生成、过滤、基于同行评审医学文献的接地和人注释半自动化流程。

Result: 实验表明，MIRIAD可将LLMs的准确率提升6.7%，并显著提高检测医疗幻觉的能力。

Conclusion: MIRIAD为医疗领域的LLMs应用提供了更可靠的知识支持，有潜力推动多项下游应用。

Abstract: LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and
flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate
medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have
been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical
knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and
integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw,
unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs
to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to
best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we
introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs,
each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical
literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering,
grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on
unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an
operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval.
Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with
MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with
the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover,
MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to
37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive
map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to
visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to
unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information
retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces,
which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.

*Atharv Kulkarni,Vivek Srikumar*

Key words: 强化学习、SQL生成、大型语言模型、执行反馈、GRPO

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了通过强化学习（RL）框架改进大型语言模型（LLM）生成SQL查询的能力，避免了传统监督微调的需求，通过执行反馈提升模型性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统方法依赖大量文本-代码对进行监督微调，而本文希望通过与数据库引擎交互的强化学习方法，仅需弱监督（问答对）来提升SQL生成能力。

Method: 将问题建模为强化学习任务，利用执行反馈作为标量奖励（失败惩罚，成功奖励），并采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）框架进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，RL-tuning显著提升了SQL生成的准确率（从31.49%增至49.83%），错误率从25.43%降至14.71%，接近更大模型SQLCoder-70B的性能。

Conclusion: 通过执行反馈而非复杂监督数据，可有效提升LLM的符号推理能力。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of code generation with a large language
model (LLM), with a focus on generating SQL queries from natural language
questions. We ask: Instead of using supervised fine tuning with text-code
pairs, can we tune a model by having it interact with a database engine? We
frame this problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the model receives
execution-based feedback from the environment in the form of scalar rewards.
These rewards penalize execution failures and assign positive values when a
query returns a correct answer. We use the rewards within the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework. We use a tabular reasoning benchmark to
test and evaluate our findings. We find that with only weak supervision in the
form of question-answer pairs, RL-tuning improves the accuracy of model
generated SQL code from 31.49 to 49.83 while reducing error percentage from
25.43% to 14.71%. This improvement allowed the model nearly match the
performance performance to the larger SQLCoder-70B model. Our work demonstrates
the potential of using execution-based feedback to improve symbolic reasoning
capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能在主观任务（如仇恨言论检测）中捕捉多视角和标注分歧，以弥补传统多数投票标注的不足。

Method: 使用上下文学习（ICL），评估四种开源LLMs在三种标签建模策略（聚合硬标签、分解硬标签和软标签）下的表现，并测试不同示例选择与排序方法。

Result: 零样本设置能生成多视角结果，少样本设置表现不佳；提示设计和示例选择对性能影响显著，示例排序影响有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在建模主观性任务时面临挑战，未来需开发更具视角意识和社会智能的模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on NLP
classification tasks. However, they typically rely on aggregated labels-often
via majority voting-which can obscure the human disagreement inherent in
subjective annotations. This study examines whether LLMs can capture multiple
perspectives and reflect annotator disagreement in subjective tasks such as
hate speech and offensive language detection. We use in-context learning (ICL)
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, evaluating four open-source LLMs across
three label modeling strategies: aggregated hard labels, and disaggregated hard
and soft labels. In few-shot prompting, we assess demonstration selection
methods based on textual similarity (BM25, PLM-based), annotation disagreement
(entropy), a combined ranking, and example ordering strategies (random vs.
curriculum-based). Results show that multi-perspective generation is viable in
zero-shot settings, while few-shot setups often fail to capture the full
spectrum of human judgments. Prompt design and demonstration selection notably
affect performance, though example ordering has limited impact. These findings
highlight the challenges of modeling subjectivity with LLMs and the importance
of building more perspective-aware, socially intelligent models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 端到端语音识别系统训练数据中可能缺乏最新或不常见的电影标题，导致识别效果不佳。本文旨在通过语音搜索和重排序技术解决这一问题。

Method: 系统分为两部分：(a)基于语音的搜索生成语音替代选项；(b)结合语音识别结果和替代选项的重排序组件，选择最终输出。

Result: 在电影标题识别基准测试中，相对降低了4.4%至7.6%的词错误率。

Conclusion: 提出的语音矫正系统有效提高了端到端语音识别系统在特定词汇上的识别性能。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using
paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality
ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as
digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as
opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles
may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and
hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a
phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic
alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer
component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic
alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6%
relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive
baselines.

Motivation: 探究NLI模型在细粒度语用推理，特别是条件句中的预设推理任务上的表现。

Method: 引入CONFER数据集，评估四种NLI模型（包括两个预训练模型）以及LLMs（如GPT-4o、LLaMA等）在零样本和少样本设置下的推理能力。

Result: NLI模型在条件句的预设推理任务上表现不佳，微调也未能改善其性能。

Conclusion: 现有NLI模型在处理条件句的预设推理时存在局限性，未来研究需进一步改进。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a
sentence pair represents entailment, contradiction, or a neutral relationship.
While NLI models perform well on many inference tasks, their ability to handle
fine-grained pragmatic inferences, particularly presupposition in conditionals,
remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CONFER, a novel dataset
designed to evaluate how NLI models process inference in conditional sentences.
We assess the performance of four NLI models, including two pre-trained models,
to examine their generalization to conditional reasoning. Additionally, we
evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, LLaMA, Gemma, and
DeepSeek-R1, in zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings to analyze their
ability to infer presuppositions with and without prior context. Our findings
indicate that NLI models struggle with presuppositional reasoning in
conditionals, and fine-tuning on existing NLI datasets does not necessarily
improve their performance.

Motivation: 研究上下文词嵌入在语义解释中的作用，特别是双宾语结构对语义的影响。

Result: 上下文词嵌入显示出对双宾语结构选择的敏感性，验证了工具的有效性。

Conclusion: 语义特征工具库在分析语言模型的语义敏感性方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce semantic-features, an extensible, easy-to-use library based on
Chronis et al. (2023) for studying contextualized word embeddings of LMs by
projecting them into interpretable spaces. We apply this tool in an experiment
where we measure the contextual effect of the choice of dative construction
(prepositional or double object) on the semantic interpretation of utterances
(Bresnan, 2007). Specifically, we test whether "London" in "I sent London the
letter." is more likely to be interpreted as an animate referent (e.g., as the
name of a person) than in "I sent the letter to London." To this end, we devise
a dataset of 450 sentence pairs, one in each dative construction, with
recipients being ambiguous with respect to person-hood vs. place-hood. By
applying semantic-features, we show that the contextualized word embeddings of
three masked language models show the expected sensitivities. This leaves us
optimistic about the usefulness of our tool.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型生成图表代码时持久错误率的根源，是模型限制还是单提示设计依赖。

Method: 采用多代理流程，包括起草、执行、修复和判断，使用现成的GPT-4o-mini模型。

Result: 在Text2Chart31和ChartX基准测试中，执行错误率分别降至4.5%和4.6%，且计算资源需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 当前基准测试中执行成功率已较高，但未来需关注图表的美学、语义保真度和可访问性改进。

Abstract: Large language models can translate natural-language chart descriptions into
runnable code, yet approximately 15\% of the generated scripts still fail to
execute, even after supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. We
investigate whether this persistent error rate stems from model limitations or
from reliance on a single-prompt design. To explore this, we propose a
lightweight multi-agent pipeline that separates drafting, execution, repair,
and judgment, using only an off-the-shelf GPT-4o-mini model. On the
\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\%
within three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline
by nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.
Similar performance is observed on the \textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error
rate of 4.6\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,
execution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6
out of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based
accessibility audit shows that only 33.3\% (\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\%
(\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.
These findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution
reliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and
accessibility.

Conclusion: 对于小型语言模型，在提示中融入专家知识比单独使用CoT技术更能提升语音钓鱼检测性能。

Abstract: We develop a voice phishing (VP) detector by fine-tuning Llama3, a
representative open-source, small language model (LM). In the prompt, we
provide carefully-designed VP evaluation criteria and apply the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. To evaluate the robustness of LMs and
highlight differences in their performance, we construct an adversarial test
dataset that places the models under challenging conditions. Moreover, to
address the lack of VP transcripts, we create transcripts by referencing
existing or new types of VP techniques. We compare cases where evaluation
criteria are included, the CoT technique is applied, or both are used together.
In the experiment, our results show that the Llama3-8B model, fine-tuned with a
dataset that includes a prompt with VP evaluation criteria, yields the best
performance among small LMs and is comparable to that of a GPT-4-based VP
detector. These findings indicate that incorporating human expert knowledge
into the prompt is more effective than using the CoT technique for small LMs in
VP detection.

Conclusion: 当前模型在开放式推理中存在短视性，受限于语言推理能力，缺乏视觉和空间推理能力。PuzzleWorld的发布旨在推动更通用、开放和创造性推理系统的研究。

Abstract: Puzzlehunts are a genre of complex, multi-step puzzles lacking well-defined
problem definitions. In contrast to conventional reasoning benchmarks
consisting of tasks with clear instructions, puzzlehunts require models to
discover the underlying problem structure from multimodal evidence and
iterative reasoning, mirroring real-world domains such as scientific discovery,
exploratory data analysis, or investigative problem-solving. Despite recent
progress in foundation models, their performance on such open-ended settings
remains largely untested. In this paper, we introduce PuzzleWorld, a
large-scale benchmark of 667 puzzlehunt-style problems designed to assess
step-by-step, open-ended, and creative multimodal reasoning. Each puzzle is
annotated with the final solution, detailed reasoning traces, and cognitive
skill labels, enabling holistic benchmarking and fine-grained diagnostic
analysis. Most state-of-the-art models achieve only 1-2% final answer accuracy,
with the best model solving only 14% of puzzles and reaching 40% stepwise
accuracy. To demonstrate the value of our reasoning annotations, we show that
fine-tuning a small model on reasoning traces improves stepwise reasoning from
4% to 11%, while training on final answers alone degrades performance to near
zero. Our error analysis reveals that current models exhibit myopic reasoning,
are bottlenecked by the limitations of language-based inference, and lack
sketching capabilities crucial for visual and spatial reasoning. We release
PuzzleWorld at https://github.com/MIT-MI/PuzzleWorld to support future work on
building more general, open-ended, and creative reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了类别平衡和语言细微问题，显著提升了性别歧视检测性能。

Abstract: The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful
language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While
automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two
key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even
in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism
(EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the
overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce
substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting
nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two
prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation
(DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate
semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion
(CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with
task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained
classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties
by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our
experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5
points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained
classification (Task C).

Conclusion: DSSP-RAG通过创新的知识整合机制，为LLMs的检索增强生成提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cost-effective approach to mitigate
the hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating the
retrieved external knowledge into the generation process. However, external
knowledge may conflict with the parametric knowledge of LLMs. Furthermore,
current LLMs lack inherent mechanisms for resolving such knowledge conflicts,
making traditional RAG methods suffer from degraded performance and stability.
Thus, we propose a Dual-Stream Knowledge-Augmented Framework for Shared-Private
Semantic Synergy (DSSP-RAG). Central to the framework is a novel approach that
refines self-attention into a mixed-attention, distinguishing shared and
private semantics for a controlled internal-external knowledge integration. To
effectively facilitate DSSP in RAG, we further introduce an unsupervised
hallucination detection method based on cognitive uncertainty, ensuring the
necessity of introducing knowledge, and an Energy Quotient (EQ) based on
attention difference matrices to reduce noise in the retrieved external
knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DSSP-RAG can
effectively resolve conflicts and enhance the complementarity of dual-stream
knowledge, leading to superior performance over strong baselines.

Key words: large language models, KV cache, in-context learning, Cartridge, self-study

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cartridge的方法，通过在离线状态下训练一个小型KV缓存来替代传统的内存密集型处理方式，显著降低了推理成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理大规模文本时，由于KV缓存的内存消耗随着输入长度增加，导致服务成本高昂。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为self-study的训练方法，通过生成关于语料库的合成对话，并使用上下文蒸馏目标训练Cartridge。

Result: Cartridges方法在性能上与传统ICL相当，但内存消耗减少38.6倍，吞吐量提高26.4倍，并扩展了模型的有效上下文长度。

Conclusion: Cartridges方法通过离线训练和self-study训练法，显著降低了推理成本，同时在性能上不输传统方法，并可灵活组合。

Abstract: Large language models are often used to answer queries grounded in large text
corpora (e.g. codebases, legal documents, or chat histories) by placing the
entire corpus in the context window and leveraging in-context learning (ICL).
Although current models support contexts of 100K-1M tokens, this setup is
costly to serve because the memory consumption of the KV cache scales with
input length. We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on
each corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a
Cartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge
can be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,
we find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token
prediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose
self-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations
about the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.
We find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of
ICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve. On challenging long-context
benchmarks, Cartridges trained with self-study match ICL performance while
using 38.6x less memory and enabling 26.4x higher throughput. Self-study also
extends the model's effective context length (e.g. from 128k to 484k tokens on
MTOB) and surprisingly, leads to Cartridges that can be composed at inference
time without retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大语言模型在文本摘要任务中表现优异，但容易继承预训练数据中的偏见，导致不公平或不合适的输出。

Method: AdvSumm通过梯度引导的嵌入层扰动增强模型的鲁棒性，对抗输入变化。

Result: 实验显示AdvSumm能有效减少名字-国籍偏见和政治框架偏见，且不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: AdvSumm在多个基准数据集上优于传统Transformer和回译等数据增强技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications.
However, these systems often inherit associative and framing biases from
pre-training data, leading to inappropriate or unfair outputs in downstream
tasks. In this work, we present AdvSumm (Adversarial Summarization), a
domain-agnostic training framework designed to mitigate bias in text
summarization through improved generalization. Inspired by adversarial
robustness, AdvSumm introduces a novel Perturber component that applies
gradient-guided perturbations at the embedding level of Sequence-to-Sequence
models, enhancing the model's robustness to input variations. We empirically
demonstrate that AdvSumm effectively reduces different types of bias in
summarization-specifically, name-nationality bias and political framing
bias-without compromising summarization quality. Compared to standard
transformers and data augmentation techniques like back-translation, AdvSumm
achieves stronger bias mitigation performance across benchmark datasets.

Result: T2MIR显著提升了上下文学习能力，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: MoE架构为ICRL提供了简单可扩展的解决方案，推动其发展。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning.
However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning
within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data
and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these
challenges, we propose \textbf{T2MIR} (\textbf{T}oken- and \textbf{T}ask-wise
\textbf{M}oE for \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{R}L), an innovative framework that
introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into
transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with
two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input
tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse
tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with
alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a
contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the
task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of
task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated
and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR
significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various
types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering
a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer
toward achievements in language and vision communities. Our code is available

Conclusion: MTPNet通过条件深度学习内化交互模式，实现了活动悬崖的统一预测，有助于加速化合物优化与设计。

Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material
design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding
targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this
paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to
incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their
target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff
prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS)
guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet
dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein
semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the
receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical
interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff
datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches,
achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream
GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through
conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs,
helping to accelerate compound optimization and design. Codes are available at:

Result: 在ADNI和AIBL数据集上表现优于现有方法，早期转换准确性提高5-12%。

Conclusion: MCI-Diff在MCI早期预测中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Early prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion is hampered by
a trade-off between immediacy--making fast predictions from a single baseline
sMRI--and accuracy--leveraging longitudinal scans to capture disease
progression. We propose MCI-Diff, a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes
clinically plausible future sMRI representations directly from baseline data,
achieving both real-time risk assessment and high predictive performance.
First, a multi-task sequence reconstruction strategy trains a shared denoising
network on interpolation and extrapolation tasks to handle irregular follow-up
sampling and learn robust latent trajectories. Second, an LLM-driven
"linguistic compass" is introduced for clinical plausibility sampling:
generated feature candidates are quantized, tokenized, and scored by a
fine-tuned language model conditioned on expected structural biomarkers,
guiding autoregressive generation toward realistic disease patterns.
Experiments on ADNI and AIBL cohorts show that MCI-Diff outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, improving early conversion accuracy by 5-12%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 针对现有向量量化（VQ）方法在量化方向时精度下降明显的问题，作者发现方向比幅度对量化更敏感，并提出解耦量化以优化准确性。

Method: PCDVQ通过极坐标解耦（PCD）将向量转换为极坐标表示，并分别量化方向和幅度；同时利用分布对齐码本构建（DACC）优化码本。

Result: 实验证明PCDVQ在2-bit量化水平上比基线方法至少提高了1.5%的零样本准确率。

Conclusion: PCDVQ为大语言模型的高压缩和准确性提供了一种新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in edge deployment
due to their massive parameter scale. Vector Quantization (VQ), a
clustering-based quantization method, serves as a prevalent solution to this
issue for its extremely low-bit (even at 2-bit) and considerable accuracy.
Since a vector is a quantity in mathematics and physics that has both direction
and magnitude, existing VQ works typically quantize them in a coupled manner.
However, we find that direction exhibits significantly greater sensitivity to
quantization compared to the magnitude. For instance, when separately
clustering the directions and magnitudes of weight vectors in LLaMA-2-7B, the
accuracy drop of zero-shot tasks are 46.5\% and 2.3\%, respectively. This gap
even increases with the reduction of clustering centers. Further, Euclidean
distance, a common metric to access vector similarities in current VQ works,
places greater emphasis on reducing the magnitude error. This property is
contrary to the above finding, unavoidably leading to larger quantization
errors. To these ends, this paper proposes Polar Coordinate Decoupled Vector
Quantization (PCDVQ), an effective and efficient VQ framework consisting of two
key modules: 1) Polar Coordinate Decoupling (PCD), which transforms vectors
into their polar coordinate representations and perform independent
quantization of the direction and magnitude parameters.2) Distribution Aligned
Codebook Construction (DACC), which optimizes the direction and magnitude
codebooks in accordance with the source distribution. Experimental results show
that PCDVQ outperforms baseline methods at 2-bit level by at least 1.5\%
zero-shot accuracy, establishing a novel paradigm for accurate and highly
compressed LLMs.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: GRPO在处理长共享前缀时引入大量计算开销，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 提出Prefix Grouper，通过重构自注意力机制，实现共享前缀的单次编码，保留端到端训练兼容性。

Result: 实验表明Prefix Grouper性能一致且计算成本显著降低，特别是在长前缀场景中。

Conclusion: Prefix Grouper是一种即插即用的高效方法，提升了GRPO的可扩展性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) enhances policy learning by
computing gradients from relative comparisons among candidate outputs that
share a common input prefix. Despite its effectiveness, GRPO introduces
substantial computational overhead when processing long shared prefixes, which
must be redundantly encoded for each group member. This inefficiency becomes a
major scalability bottleneck in long-context learning scenarios. We propose
Prefix Grouper, an efficient GRPO training algorithm that eliminates redundant
prefix computation via a Shared-Prefix Forward strategy. In particular, by
restructuring self-attention into two parts, our method enables the shared
prefix to be encoded only once, while preserving full differentiability and
compatibility with end-to-end training. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that Prefix Grouper is training-equivalent to standard GRPO:
it yields identical forward outputs and backward gradients, ensuring that the
optimization dynamics and final policy performance remain unchanged.
Empirically, our experiments confirm that Prefix Grouper achieves consistent
results while significantly reducing the computational cost of training,
particularly in long-prefix scenarios. The proposed method is fully
plug-and-play: it is compatible with existing GRPO-based architectures and can
be seamlessly integrated into current training pipelines as a drop-in
replacement, requiring no structural modifications and only minimal changes to
input construction and attention computation. Prefix Grouper enables the use of
larger group sizes under the same computational budget, thereby improving the
scalability of GRPO to more complex tasks and larger models. Code is now
available at https://github.com/johncaged/PrefixGrouper

Result: lip-rcp在ImageNet等场景中，CP集大小和计算效率均优于现有方法；并首次推导了vanilla CP的通用覆盖界。

Conclusion: lip-rcp方法兼具高效性和鲁棒性，填补了大规模鲁棒CP的空白，并为vanilla CP提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) has proven to be an effective post-hoc method for
improving the trustworthiness of neural networks by providing prediction sets
with finite-sample guarantees. However, under adversarial attacks, classical
conformal guarantees do not hold anymore: this problem is addressed in the
field of Robust Conformal Prediction. Several methods have been proposed to
provide robust CP sets with guarantees under adversarial perturbations, but,
for large scale problems, these sets are either too large or the methods are
too computationally demanding to be deployed in real life scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new method that leverages Lipschitz-bounded networks to
precisely and efficiently estimate robust CP sets. When combined with a
1-Lipschitz robust network, we demonstrate that our lip-rcp method outperforms
state-of-the-art results in both the size of the robust CP sets and
computational efficiency in medium and large-scale scenarios such as ImageNet.
Taking a different angle, we also study vanilla CP under attack, and derive new
worst-case coverage bounds of vanilla CP sets, which are valid simultaneously
for all adversarial attack levels. Our lip-rcp method makes this second
approach as efficient as vanilla CP while also allowing robustness guarantees.

Conclusion: 成功部署了一种低功耗、高精度的嵌入式监测系统，适用于长期包装状态检测。

Abstract: Package monitoring is an important topic in industrial applications, with
significant implications for operational efficiency and ecological
sustainability. In this study, we propose an approach that employs an embedded
system, placed on reusable packages, to detect their state (on a Forklift, in a
Truck, or in an undetermined location). We aim to design a system with a
lifespan of several years, corresponding to the lifespan of reusable packages.
Our analysis demonstrates that maximizing device lifespan requires minimizing
wake time. We propose a pipeline that includes data processing, training, and
evaluation of the deep learning model designed for imbalanced, multiclass time
series data collected from an embedded sensor. The method uses a
one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network architecture to classify
accelerometer data from the IoT device. Before training, two data augmentation
techniques are tested to solve the imbalance problem of the dataset: the
Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique and the ADAptive SYNthetic sampling
approach. After training, compression techniques are implemented to have a
small model size. On the considered twoclass problem, the methodology yields a
precision of 94.54% for the first class and 95.83% for the second class, while
compression techniques reduce the model size by a factor of four. The trained
model is deployed on the IoT device, where it operates with a power consumption
of 316 mW during inference.

Result: 在两个轴承生命周期数据集上验证，所提方法优于对比方法，动态HI在预测任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 动态HI能有效捕捉退化过程的动态内容，提升退化趋势建模和预测效果。

Abstract: Health indicator (HI) plays a key role in degradation assessment and
prognostics of rolling bearings. Although various HI construction methods have
been investigated, most of them rely on expert knowledge for feature extraction
and overlook capturing dynamic information hidden in sequential degradation
processes, which limits the ability of the constructed HI for degradation trend
representation and prognostics. To address these concerns, a novel dynamic HI
that considers HI-level temporal dependence is constructed through an
unsupervised framework. Specifically, a degradation feature learning module
composed of a skip-connection-based autoencoder first maps raw signals to a
representative degradation feature space (DFS) to automatically extract
essential degradation features without the need for expert knowledge.
Subsequently, in this DFS, a new HI-generating module embedded with an inner
HI-prediction block is proposed for dynamic HI construction, where the temporal
dependence between past and current HI states is guaranteed and modeled
explicitly. On this basis, the dynamic HI captures the inherent dynamic
contents of the degradation process, ensuring its effectiveness for degradation
tendency modeling and future degradation prognostics. The experiment results on
two bearing lifecycle datasets demonstrate that the proposed HI construction
method outperforms comparison methods, and the constructed dynamic HI is
superior for prognostic tasks.

Conclusion: UniPTMs突破了单一类型预测范式，并开发了轻量级变体UniPTMs-mini，平衡复杂性与性能。

Abstract: As a core mechanism of epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes, protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) require precise prediction to decipher
dynamic life activity networks. To address the limitations of existing deep
learning models in cross-modal feature fusion, domain generalization, and
architectural optimization, this study proposes UniPTMs: the first unified
framework for multi-type PTM prediction. The framework innovatively establishes
a "Master-Slave" dual-path collaborative architecture: The master path
dynamically integrates high-dimensional representations of protein sequences,
structures, and evolutionary information through a Bidirectional Gated
Cross-Attention (BGCA) module, while the slave path optimizes feature
discrepancies and recalibration between structural and traditional features
using a Low-Dimensional Fusion Network (LDFN). Complemented by a Multi-scale
Adaptive convolutional Pyramid (MACP) for capturing local feature patterns and
a Bidirectional Hierarchical Gated Fusion Network (BHGFN) enabling multi-level
feature integration across paths, the framework employs a Hierarchical Dynamic
Weighting Fusion (HDWF) mechanism to intelligently aggregate multimodal
features. Enhanced by a novel Hierarchical Contrastive loss function for
feature consistency optimization, UniPTMs demonstrates significant performance
improvements (3.2%-11.4% MCC and 4.2%-14.3% AP increases) over state-of-the-art
models across five modification types and transcends the Single-Type Prediction
Paradigm. To strike a balance between model complexity and performance, we have
also developed a lightweight variant named UniPTMs-mini.

Result: 实验表明，DoSAC在混杂环境下优于基线方法，具有更好的稳健性和策略可靠性。

Conclusion: DoSAC通过因果干预有效解决了隐藏混杂问题，为强化学习提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Hidden confounders that influence both states and actions can bias policy
learning in reinforcement learning (RL), leading to suboptimal or
non-generalizable behavior. Most RL algorithms ignore this issue, learning
policies from observational trajectories based solely on statistical
associations rather than causal effects. We propose DoSAC (Do-Calculus Soft
Actor-Critic with Backdoor Adjustment), a principled extension of the SAC
algorithm that corrects for hidden confounding via causal intervention
estimation. DoSAC estimates the interventional policy $\pi(a | \mathrm{do}(s))$
using the backdoor criterion, without requiring access to true confounders or
causal labels. To achieve this, we introduce a learnable Backdoor Reconstructor
that infers pseudo-past variables (previous state and action) from the current
state to enable backdoor adjustment from observational data. This module is
integrated into a soft actor-critic framework to compute both the
interventional policy and its entropy. Empirical results on continuous control
benchmarks show that DoSAC outperforms baselines under confounded settings,
with improved robustness, generalization, and policy reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究动机是理解模型规模如何通过训练动态改善语言模型性能，特别是针对损失曲线的独特行为。

Method: 通过分析语言模型的训练动态，研究发现损失减速现象并归因于零和学习（ZSL），进而探讨了模型规模对ZSL的缓解作用。

Result: 结果表明，扩大模型规模可以减轻损失减速现象：（1）降低减速发生的损失值，（2）提高减速后的损失改善速率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了损失减速和ZSL对语言模型训练的影响，为优化模型性能提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models,
specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models
undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of
loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in
log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing
the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of
loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type
of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL,
per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive
interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one
subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss

TL;DR: 零阶方法在机器学习中广泛应用，特别是在梯度计算不可行或昂贵的情况下。本文研究零阶优化通过标准两点估计器偏好Hessian矩阵迹较小的解，即平坦极小值，并提供了收敛速率理论支持。

Motivation: 研究零阶优化方法在隐式正则化中的作用，特别是其对平坦极小值的偏好，填补了现有理论对解的具体特性的空白。

Method: 使用标准两点估计器的零阶优化方法，分析其对Hessian矩阵迹的影响，并从理论角度提供收敛速率。

Result: 实验表明，零阶优化方法倾向于选择平坦极小值，理论分析支持其在凸和充分平滑函数中收敛到平坦极小值。

Conclusion: 零阶方法不仅收敛到平稳点，还隐含偏好平坦极小值，为实际应用中的解选择提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications
where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box
attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing
optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point,
but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained
characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show
that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors
solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to
distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates
of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and
sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers
that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions.
Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language
model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决在线处理输入实例时，如何在多个启发式算法中选择最佳算法的挑战，并克服因启发式算法状态依赖带来的性能评估困难。

Method: 提出了一种方法，通过限制每个时间步只能查询一个启发式算法的行为，并设计了一种学习策略以减少后悔值。

Result: 实现了$O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$的后悔值，并证明了其紧致性下限。

Conclusion: 证明了在MTS中，通过适当的学习策略可以接近最佳启发式算法的性能。

Abstract: We consider the following problem: We are given $\ell$ heuristics for
Metrical Task Systems (MTS), where each might be tailored to a different type
of input instances. While processing an input instance received online, we are
allowed to query the action of only one of the heuristics at each time step.
Our goal is to achieve performance comparable to the best of the given
heuristics. The main difficulty of our setting comes from the fact that the
cost paid by a heuristic at time $t$ cannot be estimated unless the same
heuristic was also queried at time $t-1$. This is related to Bandit Learning
against memory bounded adversaries (Arora et al., 2012). We show how to achieve
regret of $O(\text{OPT}^{2/3})$ and prove a tight lower bound based on the
construction of Dekel et al. (2013).

Result: 去归一化简化了流程，加快了收敛速度，并提高了反演精度。

Conclusion: 去归一化在神经网络重参数化FWI中优于预训练方法。

Abstract: Subsurface property neural network reparameterized full waveform inversion
(FWI) has emerged as an effective unsupervised learning framework, which can
invert stably with an inaccurate starting model. It updates the trainable
neural network parameters instead of fine-tuning on the subsurface model
directly. There are primarily two ways to embed the prior knowledge of the
initial model into neural networks, that is, pretraining and denormalization.
Pretraining first regulates the neural networks' parameters by fitting the
initial velocity model; Denormalization directly adds the outputs of the
network into the initial models without pretraining. In this letter, we
systematically investigate the influence of the two ways of initial model
incorporation for the neural network reparameterized FWI. We demonstrate that
pretraining requires inverting the model perturbation based on a constant
velocity value (mean) with a two-stage implementation. It leads to a complex
workflow and inconsistency of objective functions in the two-stage process,
causing the network parameters to become inactive and lose plasticity.
Experimental results demonstrate that denormalization can simplify workflows,
accelerate convergence, and enhance inversion accuracy compared with
pretraining.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在生成AI模型（如大语言模型）的高风险应用中，不确定性量化（UQ）至关重要。传统方法依赖结构化输出工具，无法适用于仅查询场景。

Method: CPQ框架通过优化查询策略和样本映射到预测集的方式，结合统计学中的缺失质量问题和Good Turing估计器，实现有限样本下的不确定性量化。

Result: 实验表明，CPQ可在三种开放任务和两种大语言模型中生成更信息丰富的预测集，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CPQ为生成模型的不确定性量化提供了新方法，适用于任何黑箱大语言模型。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for safe deployment of
generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs), especially in high
stakes applications. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a principled uncertainty
quantification framework, but classical methods focus on regression and
classification, relying on geometric distances or softmax scores: tools that
presuppose structured outputs. We depart from this paradigm by studying CP in a
query only setting, where prediction sets must be constructed solely from
finite queries to a black box generative model, introducing a new trade off
between coverage, test time query budget, and informativeness. We introduce
Conformal Prediction with Query Oracle (CPQ), a framework characterizing the
optimal interplay between these objectives. Our finite sample algorithm is
built on two core principles: one governs the optimal query policy, and the
other defines the optimal mapping from queried samples to prediction sets.
Remarkably, both are rooted in the classical missing mass problem in
statistics. Specifically, the optimal query policy depends on the rate of
decay, or the derivative, of the missing mass, for which we develop a novel
estimator. Meanwhile, the optimal mapping hinges on the missing mass itself,
which we estimate using Good Turing estimators. We then turn our focus to
implementing our method for language models, where outputs are vast, variable,
and often under specified. Fine grained experiments on three real world open
ended tasks and two LLMs, show CPQ applicability to any black box LLM and
highlight: (1) individual contribution of each principle to CPQ performance,
and (2) CPQ ability to yield significantly more informative prediction sets
than existing conformal methods for language uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the
labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their
projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient
agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the
\emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the
generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We
first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary
in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We
then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an
agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge
of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate
Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several
examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias),
and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).

Conclusion: 结合对称性和物理约束的PDE代理模型在多个任务和架构中表现优异，超越了基线方法，并改善了真实世界中的洋流预测。

Abstract: Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical
solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate
errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in
closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these
inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in
computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers
that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the
first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and
in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two
challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and
decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries
and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks,
architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network
sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates
with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or
pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick.
Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and
durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict
real-world ocean currents.

employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All

presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we
relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our
approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series,
demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.

Conclusion: 大规模批次和低熵正则化的Sinkhorn算法能够显著提升流模型的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto
another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent
velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target
points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training
flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing
exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much
harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points
independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to
train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would
greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal
transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a
highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In
practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and
$n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs.
These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered
OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the
Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a.
Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits
of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully
on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn
algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to
report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across
multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic
and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large
Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.

Conclusion: 本文为SGNN的表达性提供了新的理论框架，并通过实际应用证明了改进方法的有效性。

Abstract: Spectral features are widely incorporated within Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to improve their expressive power, or their ability to distinguish among
non-isomorphic graphs. One popular example is the usage of graph Laplacian
eigenvectors for positional encoding in MPNNs and Graph Transformers. The
expressive power of such Spectrally-enhanced GNNs (SGNNs) is usually evaluated
via the k-WL graph isomorphism test hierarchy and homomorphism counting. Yet,
these frameworks align poorly with the graph spectra, yielding limited insight
into SGNNs' expressive power. We leverage a well-studied paradigm of
classifying graphs by their largest eigenvalue multiplicity to introduce an
expressivity hierarchy for SGNNs. We then prove that many SGNNs are incomplete
even on graphs with distinct eigenvalues. To mitigate this deficiency, we adapt
rotation equivariant neural networks to the graph spectra setting to propose a
method to provably improve SGNNs' expressivity on simple spectrum graphs. We
empirically verify our theoretical claims via an image classification
experiment on the MNIST Superpixel dataset and eigenvector canonicalization on
graphs from ZINC.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep generative models has significantly improved
the realism of synthetic media, presenting both opportunities and security

challenge, we introduce SocialDF, a curated dataset reflecting real-world
deepfake challenges on social media platforms. This dataset encompasses
high-fidelity deepfakes sourced from various online ecosystems, ensuring broad

detection approach that combines facial recognition, automated speech
transcription, and a multi-agent LLM pipeline to cross-verify audio-visual
cues. Our methodology emphasizes robust, multi-modal verification techniques
that incorporate linguistic, behavioral, and contextual analysis to effectively

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods has
revolutionized molecular medicine by driving breakthroughs in genomics,
transcriptomics, drug discovery, and biological systems modeling. The
increasing quantity, multimodality, and heterogeneity of biological datasets
demand automated methods that can produce generalizable predictive models.
Recent developments in large language model-based agents have shown promise for
automating end-to-end ML experimentation on structured benchmarks. However,
when applied to heterogeneous computational biology datasets, these methods
struggle with generalization and success rates. Here, we introduce
Agentomics-ML, a fully autonomous agent-based system designed to produce a
classification model and the necessary files for reproducible training and
inference. Our method follows predefined steps of an ML experimentation
process, repeatedly interacting with the file system through Bash to complete
individual steps. Once an ML model is produced, training and validation metrics
provide scalar feedback to a reflection step to identify issues such as
overfitting. This step then creates verbal feedback for future iterations,
suggesting adjustments to steps such as data representation, model
architecture, and hyperparameter choices. We have evaluated Agentomics-ML on
several established genomic and transcriptomic benchmark datasets and show that
it outperforms existing state-of-the-art agent-based methods in both
generalization and success rates. While state-of-the-art models built by domain
experts still lead in absolute performance on the majority of the computational
biology datasets used in this work, Agentomics-ML narrows the gap for fully
autonomous systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on one of the used
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: Ravan是联邦学习中LLMs高效微调的强大且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have not yet effectively leveraged the vast
amounts of edge-device data, and federated learning (FL) offers a promising
paradigm to collaboratively fine-tune LLMs without transferring private edge
data to the cloud. To operate within the computation and communication
constraints of edge devices, recent literature on federated fine-tuning of LLMs
proposes the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and similar parameter-efficient
methods. However, LoRA-based methods suffer from accuracy degradation in FL
settings, primarily because of data and computational heterogeneity across
clients. We propose \textsc{Ravan}, an adaptive multi-head LoRA method that
balances parameter efficiency and model expressivity by reparameterizing the
weight updates as the sum of multiple LoRA heads
$s_i\textbf{B}_i\textbf{H}_i\textbf{A}_i$ in which only the core matrices
$\textbf{H}_i$ and their lightweight scaling factors $s_i$ are trained. These
trainable scaling factors let the optimization focus on the most useful heads,
recovering a higher-rank approximation of the full update without increasing
the number of communicated parameters since clients upload $s_i\textbf{H}_i$
directly. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
\textsc{Ravan} improves test accuracy by 2-8\% over prior parameter-efficient
baselines, making it a robust and scalable solution for federated fine-tuning
of LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained
transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only
a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the
pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize
\emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct
tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of
task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear
functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a
transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the
pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of
distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the
solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and
observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a
phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with
the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as
the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem
influence the transition.

Abstract: Agentic AI has gained significant interest as a research paradigm focused on
autonomy, self-directed learning, and long-term reliability of decision making.
Real-world agentic systems operate in decentralized settings on a large set of
tasks or data distributions with constraints such as limited bandwidth,
asynchronous execution, and the absence of a centralized model or even common
objectives. We posit that exploiting previously learned skills, task
similarities, and communication capabilities in a collective of agentic AI are
challenging but essential elements to enabling scalability, open-endedness, and
beneficial collaborative learning dynamics. In this paper, we introduce Modular
Sharing and Composition in Collective Learning (MOSAIC), an agentic algorithm
that allows multiple agents to independently solve different tasks while also
identifying, sharing, and reusing useful machine-learned knowledge, without
coordination, synchronization, or centralized control. MOSAIC combines three
mechanisms: (1) modular policy composition via neural network masks, (2) cosine
similarity estimation using Wasserstein embeddings for knowledge selection, and
(3) asynchronous communication and policy integration. Results on a set of RL
benchmarks show that MOSAIC has a greater sample efficiency than isolated
learners, i.e., it learns significantly faster, and in some cases, finds
solutions to tasks that cannot be solved by isolated learners. The
collaborative learning and sharing dynamics are also observed to result in the
emergence of ideal curricula of tasks, from easy to hard. These findings
support the case for collaborative learning in agentic systems to achieve
better and continuously evolving performance both at the individual and
collective levels.

Key words: conformal prediction, uncertainty quantification, distribution shifts, subpopulation shifts, machine learning

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在分布偏移时，传统conformal prediction的覆盖率保证失效，尤其是在子群分布变化的情况下。

Method: 提出新算法，适应子群分布偏移，确保覆盖率有效性，无需显式子群结构，适用于高维任务。

Result: 实验证明，在标准方法失效的场景下，新方法能可靠维持覆盖率和风险控制。

Conclusion: 新方法为子群分布偏移下的不确定性量化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning
models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees.
However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution
shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or
calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts,
where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of
subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that
provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage
without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms
scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine
learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and
language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods
reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard
conformal prediction fails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的表格分类方法（如TabPFN）在小规模数据集上表现优异，但难以扩展到大规模和复杂数据集。

Method: TabFlex采用线性注意力机制替代复杂度较高的自注意力机制，提升模型扩展性和效率。

Result: TabFlex在处理百万级样本数据集时仅需5秒，速度比TabPFN提升2倍，比XGBoost快1.5倍，并在多样数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: TabFlex是首个能高效处理大规模表格数据的表格分类模型，显著降低计算成本并保持高性能。

Abstract: Leveraging the in-context learning (ICL) capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for tabular classification has gained significant attention for its
training-free adaptability across diverse datasets. Recent advancements, like
TabPFN, excel in small-scale tabular datasets but struggle to scale for large
and complex datasets. Our work enhances the efficiency and scalability of
TabPFN for larger datasets by incorporating linear attention mechanisms as a
scalable alternative to complexity-quadratic self-attention. Our model,
TabFlex, efficiently handles tabular datasets with thousands of features and
hundreds of classes, scaling seamlessly to millions of samples. For instance,
TabFlex processes the poker-hand dataset with over a million samples in just 5
seconds. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TabFlex can achieve over a
2x speedup compared to TabPFN and a 1.5x speedup over XGBoost, outperforming 25
tested baselines in terms of efficiency across a diverse range of datasets.
Furthermore, TabFlex remains highly effective on large-scale datasets,
delivering strong performance with significantly reduced computational costs,
especially when combined with data-efficient techniques such as dimensionality
reduction and data sampling.

Abstract: In recent years there has been a considerable amount of research on local
post hoc explanations for neural networks. However, work on building
interpretable neural architectures has been relatively sparse. In this paper,
we present a novel neural architecture, CoFrNet, inspired by the form of
continued fractions which are known to have many attractive properties in
number theory, such as fast convergence of approximations to real numbers. We
show that CoFrNets can be efficiently trained as well as interpreted leveraging
their particular functional form. Moreover, we prove that such architectures
are universal approximators based on a proof strategy that is different than
the typical strategy used to prove universal approximation results for neural
networks based on infinite width (or depth), which is likely to be of
independent interest. We experiment on nonlinear synthetic functions and are
able to accurately model as well as estimate feature attributions and even
higher order terms in some cases, which is a testament to the representational
power as well as interpretability of such architectures. To further showcase
the power of CoFrNets, we experiment on seven real datasets spanning tabular,
text and image modalities, and show that they are either comparable or
significantly better than other interpretable models and multilayer
perceptrons, sometimes approaching the accuracies of state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了逆折叠模型的自由能基础，通过改进自由能估计方法，为零样本稳定性预测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot
predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the
amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy
considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely
understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a
theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger
zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the
free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the
standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and
suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We
empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in
zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统Transformer在时间序列预测中因数据特性（低信息密度、复杂依赖）和架构复杂性表现不佳，需改进。

Method: FaCTR通过低秩因子分解建模动态对称跨通道交互，并整合静态和动态协变量，采用轻量级设计。

Result: 在11个公开基准测试中表现最佳，最大模型仅需40万参数，比基线小50倍，支持自监督预训练。

Conclusion: FaCTR是轻量且可解释的时间序列预测模型，适合实际应用。

Abstract: While Transformers excel in language and vision-where inputs are semantically
rich and exhibit univariate dependency structures-their architectural
complexity leads to diminishing returns in time series forecasting. Time series
data is characterized by low per-timestep information density and complex
dependencies across channels and covariates, requiring conditioning on
structured variable interactions. To address this mismatch and
overparameterization, we propose FaCTR, a lightweight spatiotemporal
Transformer with an explicitly structural design. FaCTR injects dynamic,
symmetric cross-channel interactions-modeled via a low-rank Factorization
Machine into temporally contextualized patch embeddings through a learnable
gating mechanism. It further encodes static and dynamic covariates for
multivariate conditioning. Despite its compact design, FaCTR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on eleven public forecasting benchmarks spanning
both short-term and long-term horizons, with its largest variant using close to
only 400K parameters-on average 50x smaller than competitive spatiotemporal
transformer baselines. In addition, its structured design enables
interpretability through cross-channel influence scores-an essential
requirement for real-world decision-making. Finally, FaCTR supports
self-supervised pretraining, positioning it as a compact yet versatile
foundation for downstream time series tasks.

Result: 实验表明熵最大化虽能增强探索性和稳健性，但在需要精确控制的任务中可能误导优化，导致失败。

Conclusion: 合理平衡奖励设计和熵最大化是解决复杂控制任务的关键。

Abstract: The Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) framework is a leading
approach for achieving efficient learning and robust performance across many RL
tasks. However, MaxEnt methods have also been shown to struggle with
performance-critical control problems in practice, where non-MaxEnt algorithms
can successfully learn. In this work, we analyze how the trade-off between
robustness and optimality affects the performance of MaxEnt algorithms in
complex control tasks: while entropy maximization enhances exploration and
robustness, it can also mislead policy optimization, leading to failure in
tasks that require precise, low-entropy policies. Through experiments on a
variety of control problems, we concretely demonstrate this misleading effect.
Our analysis leads to better understanding of how to balance reward design and
entropy maximization in challenging control problems.

Abstract: The singular values of convolutional mappings encode interesting spectral
properties, which can be used, e.g., to improve generalization and robustness
of convolutional neural networks as well as to facilitate model compression.
However, the computation of singular values is typically very
resource-intensive. The naive approach involves unrolling the convolutional
mapping along the input and channel dimensions into a large and sparse
two-dimensional matrix, making the exact calculation of all singular values
infeasible due to hardware limitations. In particular, this is true for
matrices that represent convolutional mappings with large inputs and a high
number of channels. Existing efficient methods leverage the Fast Fourier
transformation (FFT) to transform convolutional mappings into the frequency
domain, enabling the computation of singular values for matrices representing
convolutions with larger input and channel dimensions. For a constant number of
channels in a given convolution, an FFT can compute N singular values in O(N
log N) complexity. In this work, we propose an approach of complexity O(N)
based on local Fourier analysis, which additionally exploits the shift
invariance of convolutional operators. We provide a theoretical analysis of our
algorithm's runtime and validate its efficiency through numerical experiments.
Our results demonstrate that our proposed method is scalable and offers a
practical solution to calculate the entire set of singular values - along with
the corresponding singular vectors if needed - for high-dimensional
convolutional mappings.

Abstract: Real-world knowledge can take various forms, including structured,
semi-structured, and unstructured data. Among these, knowledge graphs are a
form of structured human knowledge that integrate heterogeneous data sources
into structured representations but typically reduce complex n-ary relations to
simple triples, thereby losing higher-order relational details. In contrast,
hypergraphs naturally represent n-ary relations with hyperedges, which directly
connect multiple entities together. Yet hypergraph representation learning
often overlooks entity roles in hyperedges, limiting the fine-grained semantic
modelling. To address these issues, knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs combine the advantages of knowledge graphs and hypergraphs to
better capture the complex structures and role-specific semantics of real-world
knowledge. This survey provides a comprehensive review of methods handling
n-ary relational data, covering both knowledge hypergraphs and hyper-relational
knowledge graphs literatures. We propose a two-dimensional taxonomy: the first
dimension categorises models based on their methodology, i.e.,
translation-based models, tensor factorisation-based models, deep neural
network-based models, logic rules-based models, and hyperedge expansion-based
models. The second dimension classifies models according to their awareness of
entity roles and positions in n-ary relations, dividing them into aware-less,
position-aware, and role-aware approaches. Finally, we discuss existing
datasets, negative sampling strategies, and outline open challenges to inspire
future research.

Abstract: The ability to design molecules while preserving similarity to a target
molecule and/or property is crucial for various applications in drug discovery,
chemical design, and biology. We introduce in this paper an efficient
training-free method for navigating and sampling from the molecular space with
a generative Chemical Language Model (CLM), while using the molecular
similarity to the target as a guide. Our method leverages the contextual
representations learned from the CLM itself to estimate the molecular
similarity, which is then used to adjust the autoregressive sampling strategy
of the CLM. At each step of the decoding process, the method tracks the
distance of the current generations from the target and updates the logits to
encourage the preservation of similarity in generations. We implement the
method using a recently proposed $\sim$47M parameter SMILES-based CLM,
GP-MoLFormer, and therefore refer to the method as GP-MoLFormer-Sim, which
enables a test-time update of the deep generative policy to reflect the
contextual similarity to a set of guide molecules. The method is further
integrated into a genetic algorithm (GA) and tested on a set of standard
molecular optimization benchmarks involving property optimization, molecular
rediscovery, and structure-based drug design. Results show that,
GP-MoLFormer-Sim, combined with GA (GP-MoLFormer-Sim+GA) outperforms existing
training-free baseline methods, when the oracle remains black-box. The findings
in this work are a step forward in understanding and guiding the generative
mechanisms of CLMs.

Abstract: We study a relaxation of the problem of coupling probability distributions --
a list of samples is generated from one distribution and an accept is declared
if any one of these samples is identical to the sample generated from the other
distribution. We propose a novel method for generating samples, which extends
the Gumbel-max sampling suggested in Daliri et al. (arXiv:2408.07978) for
coupling probability distributions. We also establish a corresponding lower
bound on the acceptance probability, which we call the list matching lemma. We
next discuss two applications of our setup. First, we develop a new mechanism
for multi-draft speculative sampling that is simple to implement and achieves
performance competitive with baselines such as SpecTr and SpecInfer across a
range of language tasks. Our method also guarantees a certain degree of drafter
invariance with respect to the output tokens which is not supported by existing
schemes. We also provide a theoretical lower bound on the token level
acceptance probability. As our second application, we consider distributed
lossy compression with side information in a setting where a source sample is
compressed and available to multiple decoders, each with independent side
information. We propose a compression technique that is based on our
generalization of Gumbel-max sampling and show that it provides significant
gains in experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources and the MNIST image
dataset.

Result: 实验表明，AutoQD 能在无需预定义行为描述符的情况下发现多样化策略，并为无监督强化学习和多样性-质量优化提供新思路。

Conclusion: AutoQD 为开放学习和自动化行为发现提供了新方法，无需领域特定知识。

Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have shown remarkable success in
discovering diverse, high-performing solutions, but rely heavily on
hand-crafted behavioral descriptors that constrain exploration to predefined
notions of diversity. Leveraging the equivalence between policies and occupancy
measures, we present a theoretically grounded approach to automatically
generate behavioral descriptors by embedding the occupancy measures of policies
in Markov Decision Processes. Our method, AutoQD, leverages random Fourier
features to approximate the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between policy
occupancy measures, creating embeddings whose distances reflect meaningful
behavioral differences. A low-dimensional projection of these embeddings that
captures the most behaviorally significant dimensions is then used as
behavioral descriptors for off-the-shelf QD methods. We prove that our
embeddings converge to true MMD distances between occupancy measures as the
number of sampled trajectories and embedding dimensions increase. Through
experiments in multiple continuous control tasks we demonstrate AutoQD's
ability in discovering diverse policies without predefined behavioral
descriptors, presenting a well-motivated alternative to prior methods in
unsupervised Reinforcement Learning and QD optimization. Our approach opens new
possibilities for open-ended learning and automated behavior discovery in
sequential decision making settings without requiring domain-specific
knowledge.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning often involve making predictions based on
both model outputs and the opinions of human experts. In this context, we
investigate the problem of querying experts for class label predictions, using
as few human queries as possible, and leveraging the class probability
estimates of pre-trained classifiers. We develop a general Bayesian framework
for this problem, modeling expert correlation via a joint latent
representation, enabling simulation-based inference about the utility of
additional expert queries, as well as inference of posterior distributions over
unobserved expert labels. We apply our approach to two real-world medical
classification problems, as well as to CIFAR-10H and ImageNet-16H,
demonstrating substantial reductions relative to baselines in the cost of
querying human experts while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Modern Foundation Models (FMs) are typically trained on corpora spanning a
wide range of different data modalities, topics and downstream tasks. Utilizing
these models can be very computationally expensive and is out of reach for most
consumer devices. Furthermore, most of the broad FM knowledge may actually be
irrelevant for a specific task at hand. Here we explore a technique for mapping
parameters of a large Transformer to parameters of a smaller specialized model.
By making this transformation task-specific, we aim to capture a narrower scope
of the knowledge needed for performing a specific task by a smaller model. We
study our method on image modeling tasks, showing that performance of generated
models exceeds that of universal conditional models.

Abstract: We study data attribution in generative models, aiming to identify which
training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods achieve this
by tracing gradients back to training data. However, they typically treat all
network parameters uniformly, ignoring the fact that different layers encode
different types of information and may thus draw information differently from
the training set. We propose a method that models this by learning parameter
importance weights tailored for attribution, without requiring labeled data.
This allows the attribution process to adapt to the structure of the model,
capturing which training examples contribute to specific semantic aspects of an
output, such as subject, style, or background. Our method improves attribution
accuracy across diffusion models and enables fine-grained insights into how
outputs borrow from training data.

Abstract: Post-training model quantization is a widely adopted technique for reducing
the memory and computational costs of large language models (LLMs). However,
most existing methods rely on uniform or heuristic bitwidth assignments,
failing to account for the nonuniform sensitivity of weights to quantization
noise. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for allocating quantization
bitwidths based on sensitivity metrics derived from a Hessian proxy. We make
key assumptions, which allow the layer/component-wise loss function to be
expressed as an explicit function of the bitwidths. This enables a neat
formulation of the bit allocation problem as a convex optimization task, whose
closed-form solution adapts precision across weights to minimize the layer-wise
quantization loss. Inspecting the solution provides several insights (such as
the equal-loss structure), which are then exploited to design the proposed
\textbf{BAQ} (Bit Allocation Quantization) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
achieves a good trade-off between loss minimization and complexity and allows
BAQ to be integrated into standard quantization pipelines with minimal
overhead. Experimental results show that BAQ consistently outperforms GPTQ,
achieving up to 56$\times$ lower perplexity at the same bitwidth on large
language models ranging from 125M to 30B parameters. Leveraging our analytical
results derived from solving the optimal bit allocation problem, we also
provide a theoretical explanation for the observed gains. All codes of this

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 为了解决基于提示的LLMs在计算开销上的不足，提出一种无需显式提示的自适应模型。

Method: 设计了Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT)，通过在序列位置维护上下文摘要，动态调整权重以适应上下文。

Result: 在合成上下文学习任务和语言建模基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，并提升了上下文表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: CGT为高效且自适应的语言建模提供了新方向，通过将上下文直接集成到模型架构中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Transformers excel at text processing,
but their reliance on prompts for specialized behavior introduces computational
overhead. We propose a modification to a Transformer architecture that
eliminates the need for explicit prompts by learning to encode context into the
model's weights. Our Contextually Guided Transformer (CGT) model maintains a
contextual summary at each sequence position, allowing it to update the weights
on the fly based on the preceding context. This approach enables the model to
self-specialize, effectively creating a tailored model for processing
information following a given prefix. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on synthetic in-context learning tasks and language modeling benchmarks.
Furthermore, we introduce techniques for enhancing the interpretability of the
learned contextual representations, drawing connections to Variational
Autoencoders and promoting smoother, more consistent context encoding. This
work offers a novel direction for efficient and adaptable language modeling by
integrating context directly into the model's architecture.

Conclusion: 数据质量是AI模型性能的关键驱动力，DSD为商业化AI开发提供了新的数据标准。

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly
diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks,
is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally
dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were
primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and
hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced
"Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality,
structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model
performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the
DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately
10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by
extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision
dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets.
Representing a small fraction of DataSeed.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog,
the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and
multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we
document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models
against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our
evaluation publicly available.

Method: 结合显式差异矩阵（建模方向梯度）和隐式物理约束（确保消息传递符合自然规律）。

Result: 在两种真实世界有向图数据（水通量网络和城市交通流网络）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效捕捉有向图的详细拓扑差异。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle in preserving high-frequency
components of nodal signals when dealing with directed graphs. Such components
are crucial for modeling flow dynamics, without which a traditional GNN tends
to treat a graph with forward and reverse topologies equal.To make GNNs
sensitive to those high-frequency components thereby being capable to capture
detailed topological differences, this paper proposes a novel framework that
combines 1) explicit difference matrices that model directional gradients and
2) implicit physical constraints that enforce messages passing within GNNs to
be consistent with natural laws. Evaluations on two real-world directed graph
data, namely, water flux network and urban traffic flow network, demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposal.

Abstract: The evolution of sequence modeling architectures, from recurrent neural
networks and convolutional models to Transformers and structured state-space
models, reflects ongoing efforts to address the diverse temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. Despite this progress, systematically
characterizing the strengths and limitations of these architectures remains a
fundamental challenge.In this work, we propose a synthetic benchmarking
framework to evaluate how effectively different sequence models capture
distinct temporal structures. The core of this approach is to generate
synthetic targets, each characterized by a memory function and a parameter that
determines the strength of temporal dependence. This setup allows us to produce
a continuum of tasks that vary in temporal complexity, enabling fine-grained
analysis of model behavior concerning specific memory properties. We focus on
four representative memory functions, each corresponding to a distinct class of
temporal structures.Experiments on several sequence modeling architectures
confirm existing theoretical insights and reveal new findings.These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing theoretical
understandingand highlight the importance of using controllable targets with
clearly defined structures for evaluating sequence modeling architectures.

Motivation: 复杂系统优化（如药物发现和材料设计）的挑战在于未知规则和高评估成本。传统方法在训练数据外表现不佳，因此提出ManGO框架。

Method: ManGO采用扩散模型，学习设计-分数的整体关系，结合无导数引导和自适应推断时缩放，优化去噪路径。

Result: 在合成任务、机器人控制等多领域评估中，ManGO优于24种单目标和10种多目标优化方法。

Conclusion: ManGO通过统一设计-分数空间，显著提升了离线优化的泛化能力。

Abstract: Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing
high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and
engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate.
Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using
pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional
approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and
generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based
framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score
interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and
score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward
generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its
derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive
inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10
multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including
synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world
engineering optimization.

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR),
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative
interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction.
In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated

through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models
(FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated

different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central
to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the
implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality
diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3)
Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability,
and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the
manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated
applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset
requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of
resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and
conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the
next generation of XR systems.

Motivation: 当前临床AI的后部署监控不足（仅9%的FDA注册AI工具有监控计划），且现有方法多为手动和被动，不适应动态环境。

Method: 提出基于统计假设检验的标签高效测试框架，用于检测数据和模型性能变化。

Result: 该方法为临床AI系统提供可重复、科学的监控基础，并推动相关技术研究。

Conclusion: 统计有效的后部署监控是确保临床AI可靠性的关键。

Abstract: This position paper argues that post-deployment monitoring in clinical AI is
underdeveloped and proposes statistically valid and label-efficient testing
frameworks as a principled foundation for ensuring reliability and safety in
real-world deployment. A recent review found that only 9% of FDA-registered
AI-based healthcare tools include a post-deployment surveillance plan. Existing
monitoring approaches are often manual, sporadic, and reactive, making them
ill-suited for the dynamic environments in which clinical models operate. We
contend that post-deployment monitoring should be grounded in label-efficient
and statistically valid testing frameworks, offering a principled alternative
to current practices. We use the term "statistically valid" to refer to methods
that provide explicit guarantees on error rates (e.g., Type I/II error), enable
formal inference under pre-defined assumptions, and support
reproducibility--features that align with regulatory requirements.
Specifically, we propose that the detection of changes in the data and model
performance degradation should be framed as distinct statistical hypothesis
testing problems. Grounding monitoring in statistical rigor ensures a
reproducible and scientifically sound basis for maintaining the reliability of
clinical AI systems. Importantly, it also opens new research directions for the
technical community--spanning theory, methods, and tools for statistically
principled detection, attribution, and mitigation of post-deployment model
failures in real-world settings.

Result: 实验证明，AACL框架在跨动作空间的策略泛化上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AACL框架有效解决了动态能力下的持续学习问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is a powerful tool that enables agents to learn a
sequence of tasks, accumulating knowledge learned in the past and using it for
problem-solving or future task learning. However, existing CL methods often
assume that the agent's capabilities remain static within dynamic environments,
which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where capabilities dynamically
change. This paper introduces a new and realistic problem: Continual Learning
with Dynamic Capabilities (CL-DC), posing a significant challenge for CL
agents: How can policy generalization across different action spaces be
achieved? Inspired by the cortical functions, we propose an Action-Adaptive
Continual Learning framework (AACL) to address this challenge. Our framework
decouples the agent's policy from the specific action space by building an
action representation space. For a new action space, the encoder-decoder of
action representations is adaptively fine-tuned to maintain a balance between
stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we release a benchmark based on three
environments to validate the effectiveness of methods for CL-DC. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms popular methods by
generalizing the policy across action spaces.

Motivation: 为了在6G系统中实现鲁棒的语义传输，利用扩散模型的降噪能力解决语义通信中的噪声和分布不匹配问题。

Method: 基于随机微分方程（SDEs）的理论基础，推导出信噪比（SNR）与降噪步长的关系，并开发了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的语义收发器。

Result: 所提框架在低信噪比和分布偏移情况下显著优于传统神经网络基线，无需微调即可实现鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为6G系统中GAI驱动的鲁棒语义传输提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a novel semantic communication framework empowered by
generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is proposed, specifically leveraging
the capabilities of diffusion models (DMs). A rigorous theoretical foundation
is established based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which
elucidates the denoising properties of DMs in mitigating additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) in latent semantic representations. Crucially, a
closed-form analytical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
the denoising timestep is derived, enabling the optimal selection of diffusion
parameters for any given channel condition. To address the distribution
mismatch between the received signal and the DM's training data, a
mathematically principled scaling mechanism is introduced, ensuring robust
performance across a wide range of SNRs without requiring model fine-tuning.
Built upon this theoretical insight, we develop a latent diffusion model
(LDM)-based semantic transceiver, wherein a variational autoencoder (VAE) is
employed for efficient semantic compression, and a pretrained DM serves as a
universal denoiser. Notably, the proposed architecture is fully training-free
at inference time, offering high modularity and compatibility with large-scale
pretrained LDMs. This design inherently supports zero-shot generalization and
mitigates the challenges posed by out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms conventional neural-network-based semantic communication baselines,
particularly under low SNR conditions and distributional shifts, thereby
establishing a promising direction for GAI-driven robust semantic transmission
in future 6G systems.

Motivation: LoRA在微调大型基础模型时容易陷入次优解，限制了模型的泛化能力和下游操作的灵活性。

Method: CoTo通过逐步增加适配器的激活概率，结合理论分析和合作博弈方法，优化适配器的训练。

Result: 实验表明，CoTo提高了单任务性能、多任务合并准确性和剪枝鲁棒性，同时降低训练开销。

Conclusion: CoTo是一种兼容性强且高效的LoRA优化方法。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading parameter-efficient
fine-tuning technique for adapting large foundation models, yet it often locks
adapters into suboptimal minima near their initialization. This hampers model
generalization and limits downstream operators such as adapter merging and
pruning. Here, we propose CoTo, a progressive training strategy that gradually
increases adapters' activation probability over the course of fine-tuning. By
stochastically deactivating adapters, CoTo encourages more balanced
optimization and broader exploration of the loss landscape. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that CoTo promotes layer-wise dropout stability
and linear mode connectivity, and we adopt a cooperative-game approach to
quantify each adapter's marginal contribution. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoTo consistently boosts single-task performance, enhances
multi-task merging accuracy, improves pruning robustness, and reduces training
overhead, all while remaining compatible with diverse LoRA variants. Code is

Conclusion: 系统结合算法改进（如集成与多步方法）能带来显著性能提升，EEDQN的成功证明了这一点。

Abstract: While many algorithmic extensions to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) have been
proposed, there remains limited understanding of how different improvements
interact. In particular, multi-step and ensemble style extensions have shown
promise in reducing overestimation bias, thereby improving sample efficiency
and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called
Ensemble Elastic Step DQN (EEDQN), which unifies ensembles with elastic step
updates to stabilise algorithmic performance. EEDQN is designed to address two
major challenges in deep reinforcement learning: overestimation bias and sample
efficiency. We evaluated EEDQN against standard and ensemble DQN variants
across the MinAtar benchmark, a set of environments that emphasise behavioral
learning while reducing representational complexity. Our results show that
EEDQN achieves consistently robust performance across all tested environments,
outperforming baseline DQN methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art
ensemble DQNs in final returns on most of the MinAtar environments. These
findings highlight the potential of systematically combining algorithmic
improvements and provide evidence that ensemble and multi-step methods, when
carefully integrated, can yield substantial gains.

Motivation: 研究“grokking”现象在神经网络中的出现条件，尤其是如何通过正则化或其他方式诱导或消除这一现象。

Method: 通过实验和理论分析，探讨了显式（如ℓ1或核范数正则化）和隐式（如增加模型深度）正则化对“grokking”的影响。

Result: 结果表明，小规模非零正则化、模型深度和数据选择均可诱导“grokking”，且ℓ2范数不能作为泛化的可靠指标。

Conclusion: “grokking”可被多种因素诱导，且模型深度和数据选择对其有显著影响，ℓ2范数并非泛化的通用指标。

Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when
optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this
work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either
explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model
with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the
problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization
of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking.
This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces
grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding
depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using
regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the
$\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is
regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many
cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also
show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any
other hyperparameter fixed.

Abstract: Multi-label Classification (MLC) assigns an instance to one or more
non-exclusive classes. A challenge arises when the dataset contains a large
proportion of instances with no assigned class, referred to as negative data,
which can overwhelm the learning process and hinder the accurate identification
and classification of positive instances. Nevertheless, it is common in MLC
applications such as industrial defect detection, agricultural disease
identification, and healthcare diagnosis to encounter large amounts of negative
data. Assigning a separate negative class to these instances further
complicates the learning objective and introduces unnecessary redundancies. To
address this challenge, we redesign standard MLC loss functions by deriving a
likelihood of any class being present, formulated by a normalized weighted
geometric mean of the predicted class probabilities. We introduce a
regularization parameter that controls the relative contribution of the absent
class probabilities to the any-class presence likelihood in positive instances.
The any-class presence likelihood complements the multi-label learning by
encouraging the network to become more aware of implicit positive instances and
improve the label classification within those positive instances. Experiments
on large-scale datasets with negative data: SewerML, modified COCO, and
ChestX-ray14, across various networks and base loss functions show that our
loss functions consistently improve MLC performance of their standard loss
counterparts, achieving gains of up to 6.01 percentage points in F1, 8.06 in
F2, and 3.11 in mean average precision, all without additional parameters or
computational complexity. Code available at:

### [129] [Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift across Evolving Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05736)
*En Yu,Jie Lu,Guangquan Zhang*

Key words: 概念漂移,渐进学习,原型校准,无源适配,开放世界

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CSFA的新框架，用于解决开放环境中数据流的分布和标签空间共同演化问题，通过原型校准和无源适配算法实现稳定适应。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决现有方法在开放环境中对标签空间和分布共同演化的忽视问题。

Method: 提出CSFA框架，包括训练无关的原型校准机制和无源适配算法RSGS，结合锐利感知扰动和代理差距最小化。

Result: 实验证明CSFA在开放世界流数据场景中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSFA为开放世界中数据流的语义和分布演化提供了一种统一且稳定的适应框架。

Abstract: Real-world data streams exhibit inherent non-stationarity characterized by
concept drift, posing significant challenges for adaptive learning systems.
While existing methods address isolated distribution shifts, they overlook the
critical co-evolution of label spaces and distributions under limited
supervision and persistent uncertainty. To address this, we formalize
Generalized Incremental Learning under Concept Drift (GILCD), characterizing
the joint evolution of distributions and label spaces in open-environment
streaming contexts, and propose a novel framework called Calibrated Source-Free
Adaptation (CSFA). First, CSFA introduces a training-free prototype calibration
mechanism that dynamically fuses emerging prototypes with base representations,
enabling stable new-class identification without optimization overhead. Second,
we design a novel source-free adaptation algorithm, i.e., Reliable Surrogate
Gap Sharpness-aware (RSGS) minimization. It integrates sharpness-aware
perturbation loss optimization with surrogate gap minimization, while employing
entropy-based uncertainty filtering to discard unreliable samples. This
mechanism ensures robust distribution alignment and mitigates generalization
degradation caused by uncertainties. Therefore, CSFA establishes a unified
framework for stable adaptation to evolving semantics and distributions in
open-world streaming scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the superior
performance and effectiveness of CSFA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

*Rudransh Agnihotri,Ananya Pandey*

Key words: RLHF, LoRA, 奖励建模, 低成本, PPO

TL;DR: 通过结合少量JSON规则和轻量级LoRA适配器，7B LLM替代了传统重型评估模型，以低成本实现高性能奖励建模。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有的RLHF流程中，奖励模型训练成本高且复杂，需离线调整。

Method: 使用冻结的7B LLM，仅引入一行JSON规则和rank-16 LoRA适配器（0.8%参数），替代传统重型模型。

Result: 在RewardBench上达到96.2%准确率，优于27B-70B奖励网络；7B模型在线PPO中超越70B DPO基线。

Conclusion: 轻量级LoRA与提示工程结合，实现了高效、透明且可调的奖励功能，无需离线阶段。

Abstract: Reward-model training is the cost bottleneck in modern Reinforcement Learning
Human Feedback (RLHF) pipelines, often requiring tens of billions of parameters
and an offline preference-tuning phase. In the proposed method, a frozen,
instruction-tuned 7B LLM is augmented with only a one line JSON rubric and a
rank-16 LoRA adapter (affecting just 0.8% of the model's parameters), enabling
it to serve as a complete substitute for the previously used heavyweight
evaluation models. The plug-and-play judge achieves 96.2% accuracy on
RewardBench, outperforming specialized reward networks ranging from 27B to 70B
parameters. Additionally, it allows a 7B actor to outperform the top 70B DPO
baseline, which scores 61.8%, by achieving 92% exact match accuracy on GSM-8K
utilizing online PPO. Thorough ablations indicate that (i) six in context
demonstrations deliver the majority of the zero-to-few-shot improvements
(+2pp), and (ii) the LoRA effectively addresses the remaining disparity,
particularly in the safety and adversarial Chat-Hard segments. The proposed
model introduces HH-Rationales, a subset of 10,000 pairs from Anthropic
HH-RLHF, to examine interpretability, accompanied by human generated
justifications. GPT-4 scoring indicates that our LoRA judge attains
approximately = 9/10 in similarity to human explanations, while zero-shot
judges score around =5/10. These results indicate that the combination of
prompt engineering and tiny LoRA produces a cost effective, transparent, and
easily adjustable reward function, removing the offline phase while achieving
new state-of-the-art outcomes for both static evaluation and online RLHF.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: COVID-19大流行凸显了准确、及时预测住院需求的必要性，尤其在变异株激增时，现有模型表现不佳。

Method: 研究提出了一个并行LSTM框架，结合社交临近性（SPH）时空特征，并使用多时间范围集成策略。

Result: 在Delta和Omicron激增期间，模型表现优于现有方法，预测误差平均减少27至69人次/州。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提升了住院预测，还强调了时空特征在传染病传播动态建模中的重要性。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic's severe impact highlighted the need for accurate,
timely hospitalization forecasting to support effective healthcare planning.
However, most forecasting models struggled, especially during variant surges,
when they were needed most. This study introduces a novel Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) framework for forecasting daily state-level incident
hospitalizations in the United States. We present a spatiotemporal feature,
Social Proximity to Hospitalizations (SPH), derived from Facebook's Social
Connectedness Index to improve forecasts. SPH serves as a proxy for interstate
population interaction, capturing transmission dynamics across space and time.
Our parallel LSTM architecture captures both short- and long-term temporal
dependencies, and our multi-horizon ensembling strategy balances consistency
and forecasting error. Evaluation against COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble models
during the Delta and Omicron surges reveals superiority of our model. On
average, our model surpasses the ensemble by 27, 42, 54, and 69
hospitalizations per state on the $7^{th}$, $14^{th}$, $21^{st}$, and $28^{th}$
forecast days, respectively, during the Omicron surge. Data-ablation
experiments confirm SPH's predictive power, highlighting its effectiveness in
enhancing forecasting models. This research not only advances hospitalization
forecasting but also underscores the significance of spatiotemporal features,
such as SPH, in refining predictive performance in modeling the complex
dynamics of infectious disease spread.

Motivation: 传统最优执行策略在动态市场中表现不佳，flowOE旨在通过学习多种专家策略并结合市场条件，优化执行效果。

Method: flowOE采用流匹配模型和模仿学习，结合精细的损失函数，动态选择并改进专家行为以适应市场变化。

Result: 实证表明flowOE在多种市场条件下均优于传统模型，实现了更高收益和更低风险。

Conclusion: flowOE展示了在动态市场中优化执行策略的潜力和实用性。

Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically
transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible
outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or
volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static
Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets.
This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow
matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set
of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable
expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the
incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process,
enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert
actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow
matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical
evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE
significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and
other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These
results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to
enhance adaptive optimal execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 离线强化学习的静态数据集存在分布偏差，导致泛化性受限。传统的数据增强方法仅关注未来轨迹的重建，而忽略历史过渡的探索，限制了行为模式的多样性发现。

Method: 通过双向扩散过程（前向预测未来动态和后向追踪历史过渡），BiTrajDiff以关键状态为锚点扩展状态空间，增强数据多样性。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，BiTrajDiff表现优于其他先进数据增强方法，显著提升离线强化学习性能。

Conclusion: BiTrajDiff通过双向轨迹扩散有效提升离线强化学习的数据多样性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that
effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on
pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit
distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this
limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which
leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising
results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future
trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history
transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders
the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to
critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we
introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework
for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any
intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task
into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating
forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating
backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can
efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially
valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating
dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite
demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other
advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 探讨在加密货币限价订单簿（LOB）数据分析中，模型复杂度的增加是否真正提升短期价格预测能力，还是数据预处理和特征工程起主要作用。

Method: 比较了一系列模型（从逻辑回归、XGBoost到深度架构如DeepLOB和Conv1D+LSTM），并引入了两种数据过滤管道（卡尔曼滤波、Savitzky Golay），评估了二元和三元标记方案。

Result: 经过数据预处理和超参数调整，简单模型的性能可以媲美甚至超过复杂网络，且具有更快的推理速度和更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 在LOB数据分析中，简单模型通过优化可以高效替代复杂网络，尤其在关注推理速度和可解释性时。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency price dynamics are driven largely by microstructural supply
demand imbalances in the limit order book (LOB), yet the highly noisy nature of
LOB data complicates the signal extraction process. Prior research has
demonstrated that deep-learning architectures can yield promising predictive
performance on pre-processed equity and futures LOB data, but they often treat
model complexity as an unqualified virtue. In this paper, we aim to examine
whether adding extra hidden layers or parameters to "blackbox ish" neural
networks genuinely enhances short term price forecasting, or if gains are
primarily attributable to data preprocessing and feature engineering. We
benchmark a spectrum of models from interpretable baselines, logistic
regression, XGBoost to deep architectures (DeepLOB, Conv1D+LSTM) on BTC/USDT
LOB snapshots sampled at 100 ms to multi second intervals using publicly
available Bybit data. We introduce two data filtering pipelines (Kalman,
Savitzky Golay) and evaluate both binary (up/down) and ternary (up/flat/down)
labeling schemes. Our analysis compares models on out of sample accuracy,
latency, and robustness to noise. Results reveal that, with data preprocessing
and hyperparameter tuning, simpler models can match and even exceed the
performance of more complex networks, offering faster inference and greater
interpretability.

Result: 在新构建的 apo 结构基准测试中，EF1% 从 11.75 提升到 37.19，且在 holo 结构上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在缺乏实验解析蛋白-配体复合物的场景中具有潜力，可推动首创新药的发现。

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) is a critical component of modern drug discovery, yet
most existing methods--whether physics-based or deep learning-based--are
developed around holo protein structures with known ligand-bound pockets.
Consequently, their performance degrades significantly on apo or predicted
structures such as those from AlphaFold2, which are more representative of
real-world early-stage drug discovery, where pocket information is often
missing. In this paper, we introduce an alignment-and-aggregation framework to
enable accurate virtual screening under structural uncertainty. Our method
comprises two core components: (1) a tri-modal contrastive learning module that
aligns representations of the ligand, the holo pocket, and cavities detected
from structures, thereby enhancing robustness to pocket localization error; and
(2) a cross-attention based adapter for dynamically aggregating candidate
binding sites, enabling the model to learn from activity data even without
precise pocket annotations. We evaluated our method on a newly curated
benchmark of apo structures, where it significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in blind apo setting, improving the early enrichment
factor (EF1%) from 11.75 to 37.19. Notably, it also maintains strong
performance on holo structures. These results demonstrate the promise of our
approach in advancing first-in-class drug discovery, particularly in scenarios
lacking experimentally resolved protein-ligand complexes.

Abstract: Understanding the function of individual units in a neural network is an
important building block for mechanistic interpretability. This is often done
by generating a simple text explanation of the behavior of individual neurons
or units. For these explanations to be useful, we must understand how reliable
and truthful they are. In this work we unify many existing explanation
evaluation methods under one mathematical framework. This allows us to compare
existing evaluation metrics, understand the evaluation pipeline with increased
clarity and apply existing statistical methods on the evaluation. In addition,
we propose two simple sanity checks on the evaluation metrics and show that
many commonly used metrics fail these tests and do not change their score after
massive changes to the concept labels. Based on our experimental and
theoretical results, we propose guidelines that future evaluations should
follow and identify a set of reliable evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 降低通信复杂度对于高效的分散优化至关重要，但现有方法需要高精度的子问题解，导致计算开销较大。

Result: 实验结果表明SPDO显著优于现有方法，实现了最优的通信和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: SPDO方法为分散优化提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reducing communication complexity is critical for efficient decentralized
optimization. The proximal decentralized optimization (PDO) framework is
particularly appealing, as methods within this framework can exploit functional
similarity among nodes to reduce communication rounds. Specifically, when local
functions at different nodes are similar, these methods achieve faster
convergence with fewer communication steps. However, existing PDO methods often
require highly accurate solutions to subproblems associated with the proximal
operator, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we
propose the Stabilized Proximal Decentralized Optimization (SPDO) method, which
achieves state-of-the-art communication and computational complexities within
the PDO framework. Additionally, we refine the analysis of existing PDO methods
by relaxing subproblem accuracy requirements and leveraging average functional
similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that SPDO significantly
outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: EqCollide能推广到更多碰撞对象和更长时域，且对群变换输入具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging
task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body
interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of
equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and
limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end
equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their
collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and
velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural
Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions
among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct
velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features,
enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental
results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations
across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82%
lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model.
Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended
temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is characterized by flexibility, high precision, and
refined structure. As a critical component within computational finance, option
pricing with machine learning requires both high predictive accuracy and
reduced structural complexity-features that align well with the inherent
advantages of ensemble learning. This paper investigates the application of
ensemble learning to option pricing, and conducts a comparative analysis with
classical machine learning models to assess their performance in terms of
accuracy, local feature extraction, and robustness to noise. A novel
experimental strategy is introduced, leveraging parameter transfer across
experiments to improve robustness and realism in financial simulations.Building
upon this strategy, an evaluation mechanism is developed that incorporates a
scoring strategy and a weighted evaluation strategy explicitly emphasizing the
foundational role of financial theory. This mechanism embodies an orderly
integration of theoretical finance and computational methods. In addition, the
study examines the interaction between sliding window technique and noise,
revealing nuanced patterns that suggest a potential connection relevant to
ongoing research in machine learning and data science.

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks,
in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an
extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable
attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how
deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been
proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work
that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for
practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar
phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the
cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal
Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following
three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to
their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class
means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a
one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to
logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the
class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly
local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables
and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM
framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a
variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,
highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.

Result: PiPE在分子性质预测、图分类和分布外泛化等任务中表现优异，理论证明其表达能力更强。

Conclusion: PiPE结合了PE和PH的优点，有效提升了图表示学习的性能，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The local inductive bias of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs)
hampers their ability to exploit key structural information (e.g., connectivity
and cycles). Positional encoding (PE) and Persistent Homology (PH) have emerged
as two promising approaches to mitigate this issue. PE schemes endow GNNs with
location-aware features, while PH methods enhance GNNs with multiresolution
topological features. However, a rigorous theoretical characterization of the
relative merits and shortcomings of PE and PH has remained elusive. We bridge
this gap by establishing that neither paradigm is more expressive than the
other, providing novel constructions where one approach fails but the other
succeeds. Our insights inform the design of a novel learnable method, PiPE
(Persistence-informed Positional Encoding), which is provably more expressive
than both PH and PE. PiPE demonstrates strong performance across a variety of
tasks (e.g., molecule property prediction, graph classification, and
out-of-distribution generalization), thereby advancing the frontiers of graph
representation learning. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更具韧性和适应性的机器学习系统提供了途径。

Abstract: Backward compatible representation learning enables updated models to
integrate seamlessly with existing ones, avoiding to reprocess stored data.
Despite recent advances, existing compatibility approaches in Euclidean space
neglect the uncertainty in the old embedding model and force the new model to
reconstruct outdated representations regardless of their quality, thereby
hindering the learning process of the new model. In this paper, we propose to
switch perspectives to hyperbolic geometry, where we treat time as a natural
axis for capturing a model's confidence and evolution. By lifting embeddings
into hyperbolic space and constraining updated embeddings to lie within the
entailment cone of the old ones, we maintain generational consistency across
models while accounting for uncertainties in the representations. To further
enhance compatibility, we introduce a robust contrastive alignment loss that
dynamically adjusts alignment weights based on the uncertainty of the old
embeddings. Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in
achieving compatibility, paving the way for more resilient and adaptable
machine learning systems.

Conclusion: WDAN是一种模型无关的框架，有效解决了时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Forecasting non-stationary time series is a challenging task because their
statistical properties often change over time, making it hard for deep models
to generalize well. Instance-level normalization techniques can help address
shifts in temporal distribution. However, most existing methods overlook the
multi-component nature of time series, where different components exhibit
distinct non-stationary behaviors. In this paper, we propose Wavelet-based
Disentangled Adaptive Normalization (WDAN), a model-agnostic framework designed
to address non-stationarity in time series forecasting. WDAN uses discrete
wavelet transforms to break down the input into low-frequency trends and
high-frequency fluctuations. It then applies tailored normalization strategies
to each part. For trend components that exhibit strong non-stationarity, we
apply first-order differencing to extract stable features used for predicting
normalization parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that WDAN consistently improves forecasting accuracy across various
backbone model. Code is available at this repository:

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical but costly procedure in neural architecture search
(NAS). Performance predictors have been widely adopted to reduce evaluation
costs by directly estimating architecture performance. The effectiveness of
predictors is heavily influenced by the choice of loss functions. While
traditional predictors employ regression loss functions to evaluate the
absolute accuracy of architectures, recent approaches have explored various
ranking-based loss functions, such as pairwise and listwise ranking losses, to
focus on the ranking of architecture performance. Despite their success in NAS,
the effectiveness and characteristics of these loss functions have not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive
study on loss functions in performance predictors, categorizing them into three
main types: regression, ranking, and weighted loss functions. Specifically, we
assess eight loss functions using a range of NAS-relevant metrics on 13 tasks
across five search spaces. Our results reveal that specific categories of loss
functions can be effectively combined to enhance predictor-based NAS.
Furthermore, our findings could provide practical guidance for selecting
appropriate loss functions for various tasks. We hope this work provides
meaningful insights to guide the development of loss functions for
predictor-based methods in the NAS community.

Abstract: Clustering ensemble has emerged as an important research topic in the field
of machine learning. Although numerous methods have been proposed to improve
clustering quality, most existing approaches overlook the need for
interpretability in high-stakes applications. In domains such as medical
diagnosis and financial risk assessment, algorithms must not only be accurate
but also interpretable to ensure transparent and trustworthy decision-making.
Therefore, to fill the gap of lack of interpretable algorithms in the field of
clustering ensemble, we propose the first interpretable clustering ensemble
algorithm in the literature. By treating base partitions as categorical
variables, our method constructs a decision tree in the original feature space
and use the statistical association test to guide the tree building process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves comparable
performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) clustering ensemble methods while
maintaining an additional feature of interpretability. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first interpretable algorithm specifically designed for
clustering ensemble, offering a new perspective for future research in
interpretable clustering.

Conclusion: 该方法是梯度优化的一种有竞争力替代方案，尤其在并行化和处理不可微操作方面表现优异。

Abstract: We present a feasibility-seeking approach to neural network training. This
mathematical optimization framework is distinct from conventional
gradient-based loss minimization and uses projection operators and iterative
projection algorithms. We reformulate training as a large-scale feasibility
problem: finding network parameters and states that satisfy local constraints
derived from its elementary operations. Training then involves projecting onto
these constraints, a local operation that can be parallelized across the
network. We introduce PJAX, a JAX-based software framework that enables this
paradigm. PJAX composes projection operators for elementary operations,
automatically deriving the solution operators for the feasibility problems
(akin to autodiff for derivatives). It inherently supports GPU/TPU
acceleration, provides a familiar NumPy-like API, and is extensible. We train
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, RNNs) on standard benchmarks using PJAX,
demonstrating its functionality and generality. Our results show that this
approach is as a compelling alternative to gradient-based training, with clear
advantages in parallelism and the ability to handle non-differentiable
operations.

Result: 在4个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法，并成功部署于EDF的监测服务。

Conclusion: NILMFormer有效解决了数据分布漂移问题，提升了NILM性能。

Abstract: Millions of smart meters have been deployed worldwide, collecting the total
power consumed by individual households. Based on these data, electricity
suppliers offer their clients energy monitoring solutions to provide feedback
on the consumption of their individual appliances. Historically, such estimates
have relied on statistical methods that use coarse-grained total monthly
consumption and static customer data, such as appliance ownership.
Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the problem of disaggregating a
household's collected total power consumption to retrieve the consumed power
for individual appliances. Current state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions for NILM
are based on deep-learning (DL) and operate on subsequences of an entire
household consumption reading. However, the non-stationary nature of real-world
smart meter data leads to a drift in the data distribution within each
segmented window, which significantly affects model performance. This paper
introduces NILMFormer, a Transformer-based architecture that incorporates a new
subsequence stationarization/de-stationarization scheme to mitigate the
distribution drift and that uses a novel positional encoding that relies only
on the subsequence's timestamp information. Experiments with 4 real-world
datasets show that NILMFormer significantly outperforms the SotA approaches.
Our solution has been deployed as the backbone algorithm for EDF's
(Electricit\'e De France) consumption monitoring service, delivering detailed
insights to millions of customers about their individual appliances' power
consumption. This paper appeared in KDD 2025.

Abstract: Improving smart grid system management is crucial in the fight against
climate change, and enabling consumers to play an active role in this effort is
a significant challenge for electricity suppliers. In this regard, millions of
smart meters have been deployed worldwide in the last decade, recording the
main electricity power consumed in individual households. This data produces
valuable information that can help them reduce their electricity footprint;
nevertheless, the collected signal aggregates the consumption of the different
appliances running simultaneously in the house, making it difficult to
apprehend. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) refers to the challenge of
estimating the power consumption, pattern, or on/off state activation of
individual appliances using the main smart meter signal. Recent methods
proposed to tackle this task are based on a fully supervised deep-learning
approach that requires both the aggregate signal and the ground truth of
individual appliance power. However, such labels are expensive to collect and
extremely scarce in practice, as they require conducting intrusive surveys in
households to monitor each appliance. In this paper, we introduce CamAL, a
weakly supervised approach for appliance pattern localization that only
requires information on the presence of an appliance in a household to be
trained. CamAL merges an ensemble of deep-learning classifiers combined with an
explainable classification method to be able to localize appliance patterns.
Our experimental evaluation, conducted on 4 real-world datasets, demonstrates
that CamAL significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised baselines and
that current SotA fully supervised NILM approaches require significantly more
labels to reach CamAL performances. The source of our experiments is available
at: https://github.com/adrienpetralia/CamAL. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了跟车模型的预测能力，为驾驶行为建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in car-following modeling lies in accurately
representing the multi-scale complexity of driving behaviors, particularly the
intra-driver heterogeneity where a single driver's actions fluctuate
dynamically under varying conditions. While existing models, both conventional
and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often
emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions,
limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver
under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel
data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving
regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular
motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the
proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for
discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for
continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes
and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and
intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up
segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust
characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios.
Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces
prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%),
speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such
as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.

Abstract: In recent years, electricity suppliers have installed millions of smart
meters worldwide to improve the management of the smart grid system. These
meters collect a large amount of electrical consumption data to produce
valuable information to help consumers reduce their electricity footprint.
However, having non-expert users (e.g., consumers or sales advisors) understand
these data and derive usage patterns for different appliances has become a
significant challenge for electricity suppliers because these data record the
aggregated behavior of all appliances. At the same time, ground-truth labels
(which could train appliance detection and localization models) are expensive
to collect and extremely scarce in practice. This paper introduces DeviceScope,
an interactive tool designed to facilitate understanding smart meter data by
detecting and localizing individual appliance patterns within a given time
period. Our system is based on CamAL (Class Activation Map-based Appliance
Localization), a novel weakly supervised approach for appliance localization
that only requires the knowledge of the existence of an appliance in a
household to be trained. This paper appeared in ICDE 2025.

Result: 该方法在多种PDE问题上表现出强通用性，显著提升解精度，且计算成本未大幅增加。

Conclusion: Over-PINNs通过更高阶的物理约束嵌入，有效提升了PINNs的计算精度，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone of
mathematical physics. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
have significantly reduced the dependence on large datasets by embedding
physical laws directly into the training of neural networks. However, when
dealing with complex problems, the accuracy of PINNs still has room for
improvement. To address this issue, we introduce the Over-PINNs framework,
which leverages automatic differentiation (AD) to generate higher-order
auxiliary equations that impose additional physical constraints. These
equations are incorporated as extra loss terms in the training process,
effectively enhancing the model's ability to capture physical information
through an "overdetermined" approach. Numerical results illustrate that this
method exhibits strong versatility in solving various types of PDEs. It
achieves a significant improvement in solution accuracy without incurring
substantial additional computational costs.

Conclusion: XGBoost模型能有效减轻大规模交通分配问题的计算负担。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the impact of road maintenance schedules on traffic
conditions is important because maintenance operations can substantially worsen
congestion if not carefully planned. Reliable estimates allow planners to avoid
excessive delays during periods of roadwork. Since the exact increase in
congestion is difficult to predict analytically, traffic simulations are
commonly used to assess the redistribution of the flow of traffic. However,
when applied to long-term maintenance planning involving many overlapping
projects and scheduling alternatives, these simulations must be run thousands
of times, resulting in a significant computational burden. This paper
investigates the use of machine learning-based surrogate models to predict
network-wide congestion caused by simultaneous road renovations. We frame the
problem as a supervised learning task, using one-hot encodings, engineered
traffic features, and heuristic approximations. A range of linear,
ensemble-based, probabilistic, and neural regression models is evaluated under
an online learning framework in which data progressively becomes available. The
experimental results show that the Costliest Subset Heuristic provides a
reasonable approximation when limited training data is available, and that most
regression models fail to outperform it, with the exception of XGBoost, which
achieves substantially better accuracy. In overall performance, XGBoost
significantly outperforms alternatives in a range of metrics, most strikingly
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Pinball loss, where it achieves a
MAPE of 11% and outperforms the next-best model by 20% and 38% respectively.
This modeling approach has the potential to reduce the computational burden of
large-scale traffic assignment problems in maintenance planning.

Conclusion: C-EDL在无需重新训练的情况下，有效提升了模型的不确定性量化能力，保持了高准确性和低计算开销。

Abstract: Reliability of deep learning models is critical for deployment in high-stakes
applications, where out-of-distribution or adversarial inputs may lead to
detrimental outcomes. Evidential Deep Learning, an efficient paradigm for
uncertainty quantification, models predictions as Dirichlet distributions of a
single forward pass. However, EDL is particularly vulnerable to adversarially
perturbed inputs, making overconfident errors. Conflict-aware Evidential Deep
Learning (C-EDL) is a lightweight post-hoc uncertainty quantification approach
that mitigates these issues, enhancing adversarial and OOD robustness without
retraining. C-EDL generates diverse, task-preserving transformations per input
and quantifies representational disagreement to calibrate uncertainty estimates
when needed. C-EDL's conflict-aware prediction adjustment improves detection of
OOD and adversarial inputs, maintaining high in-distribution accuracy and low
computational overhead. Our experimental evaluation shows that C-EDL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art EDL variants and competitive
baselines, achieving substantial reductions in coverage for OOD data (up to
55%) and adversarial data (up to 90%), across a range of datasets, attack
types, and uncertainty metrics.

Abstract: While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in
generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite
its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a
variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply
VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce
Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents
heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We
hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching,
enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and
discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow
matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences.
Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
compared to baselines.

inventories, higher labor and storage space costs, etc. On the other hand, when
forecasts underestimate the level of sales, firms experience lost sales,
shortages, and impact on the reputation of the retailer in their relevant
market. Accurate forecasting presents a competitive advantage for companies. It
facilitates the achievement of revenue and profit goals and execution of
pricing strategy and tactics. In this study, we provide an exhaustive
assessment of the forecasting models applied to a high-resolution
brick-and-mortar retail dataset. Our forecasting framework addresses the
problems found in retail environments, including intermittent demand, missing
values, and frequent product turnover. We compare tree-based ensembles (such as
XGBoost and LightGBM) and state-of-the-art neural network architectures
(including N-BEATS, NHITS, and the Temporal Fusion Transformer) across various
experimental settings. Our results show that localized modeling strategies
especially those using tree-based models on individual groups with non-imputed
data, consistently deliver superior forecasting accuracy and computational
efficiency. In contrast, neural models benefit from advanced imputation
methods, yet still fall short in handling the irregularities typical of
physical retail data. These results further practical understanding for model
selection in retail environment and highlight the significance of data
preprocessing to improve forecast performance.

Abstract: One-dimensional signal decomposition is a well-established and widely used
technique across various scientific fields. It serves as a highly valuable
pre-processing step for data analysis. While traditional decomposition
techniques often rely on mathematical models, recent research suggests that
applying the latest deep learning models to this problem presents an exciting,
unexplored area with promising potential. This work presents a novel method for
the additive decomposition of one-dimensional signals. We leverage the
Transformer architecture to decompose signals into their constituent
components: piece-wise constant, smooth (low-frequency oscillatory), textured
(high-frequency oscillatory), and a noise component. Our model, trained on
synthetic data, achieves excellent accuracy in modeling and decomposing input
signals from the same distribution, as demonstrated by the experimental
results.

Conclusion: C-PG算法为解决CRL问题提供了新的理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses sequential decision-making
problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected
return while meeting domain-specific constraints. In this setting, policy-based
methods are widely used thanks to their advantages when dealing with
continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an
action-based or a parameter-based exploration strategy, depending on whether
they learn the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic
hyperpolicy. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which
enjoys global last-iterate convergence guarantees under gradient domination
assumptions. Furthermore, under specific noise models where the (hyper)policy
is expressed as a stochastic perturbation of the actions or of the parameters
of an underlying deterministic policy, we additionally establish global
last-iterate convergence guarantees of C-PG to the optimal deterministic
policy. This holds when learning a stochastic (hyper)policy and subsequently
switching off the stochasticity at the end of training, thereby deploying a
deterministic policy. Finally, we empirically validate both the action-based
(C-PGAE) and parameter-based (C-PGPE) variants of C-PG on constrained control
tasks, and compare them against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their
effectiveness, in particular when deploying deterministic policies after
training.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often encounter significant performance
degradation under distribution shifts between training and test data, hindering
their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have proposed
various methods to address the out-of-distribution generalization challenge,
with many methods in the graph domain focusing on directly identifying an
invariant subgraph that is predictive of the target label. However, we argue
that identifying the edges from the invariant subgraph directly is challenging
and error-prone, especially when some spurious edges exhibit strong
correlations with the targets. In this paper, we propose PrunE, the first
pruning-based graph OOD method that eliminates spurious edges to improve OOD
generalizability. By pruning spurious edges, \mine{} retains the invariant
subgraph more comprehensively, which is critical for OOD generalization.
Specifically, PrunE employs two regularization terms to prune spurious edges:
1) graph size constraint to exclude uninformative spurious edges, and 2)
$\epsilon$-probability alignment to further suppress the occurrence of spurious
edges. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that
PrunE achieves superior OOD performance and outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods significantly. Codes are available at:

Conclusion: 向量量化方法在扩散模型压缩中表现优异，显著提升了低比特量化性能，同时通过高效内核实现了硬件无关的FLOPs节省。

Abstract: Significant investments have been made towards the commodification of
diffusion models for generation of diverse media. Their mass-market adoption is
however still hobbled by the intense hardware resource requirements of
diffusion model inference. Model quantization strategies tailored specifically
towards diffusion models have been useful in easing this burden, yet have
generally explored the Uniform Scalar Quantization (USQ) family of quantization
methods. In contrast, Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, which operate on groups
of multiple related weights as the basic unit of compression, have seen
substantial success in Large Language Model (LLM) quantization. In this work,
we apply codebook-based additive vector quantization to the problem of
diffusion model compression. Our resulting approach achieves a new Pareto
frontier for the extremely low-bit weight quantization on the standard
class-conditional benchmark of LDM-4 on ImageNet at 20 inference time steps.
Notably, we report sFID 1.92 points lower than the full-precision model at W4A8
and the best-reported results for FID, sFID and ISC at W2A8. We are also able
to demonstrate FLOPs savings on arbitrary hardware via an efficient inference
kernel, as opposed to savings resulting from small integer operations which may
lack broad hardware support.

Conclusion: 结合贝尔曼最优算子并通过退火方法缓解偏差，可以显著提升连续动作RL算法的性能。

Abstract: For continuous action spaces, actor-critic methods are widely used in online
reinforcement learning (RL). However, unlike RL algorithms for discrete
actions, which generally model the optimal value function using the Bellman
optimality operator, RL algorithms for continuous actions typically model
Q-values for the current policy using the Bellman operator. These algorithms
for continuous actions rely exclusively on policy updates for improvement,
which often results in low sample efficiency. This study examines the
effectiveness of incorporating the Bellman optimality operator into
actor-critic frameworks. Experiments in a simple environment show that modeling
optimal values accelerates learning but leads to overestimation bias. To
address this, we propose an annealing approach that gradually transitions from
the Bellman optimality operator to the Bellman operator, thereby accelerating
learning while mitigating bias. Our method, combined with TD3 and SAC,
significantly outperforms existing approaches across various locomotion and
manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and robustness to
hyperparameters related to optimality.

Abstract: Long-range graph tasks -- those dependent on interactions between distant
nodes -- are an open problem in graph neural network research. Real-world
benchmark tasks, especially the Long Range Graph Benchmark, have become popular
for validating the long-range capability of proposed architectures. However,
this is an empirical approach that lacks both robustness and theoretical
underpinning; a more principled characterization of the long-range problem is
required. To bridge this gap, we formalize long-range interactions in graph
tasks, introduce a range measure for operators on graphs, and validate it with
synthetic experiments. We then leverage our measure to examine commonly used
tasks and architectures, and discuss to what extent they are, in fact,
long-range. We believe our work advances efforts to define and address the
long-range problem on graphs, and that our range measure will aid evaluation of
new datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: FedBE为联邦环境中的灾难性遗忘和异构性问题提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了模型表现。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FedFT) of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as
a promising solution for adapting models to distributed data environments while
ensuring data privacy.
  Existing FedFT methods predominantly utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques to reduce communication and computation overhead.
  However, they often fail to adequately address the catastrophic forgetting, a
critical challenge arising from continual adaptation in distributed
environments. The traditional centralized fine-tuning methods, which are not
designed for the heterogeneous and privacy-constrained nature of federated
environments, struggle to mitigate this issue effectively. Moreover, the
challenge is further exacerbated by significant variation in data distributions
and device capabilities across clients, which leads to intensified forgetting
and degraded model generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose FedBE, a
novel FedFT framework that integrates an adaptive transformer block expansion
mechanism with a dynamic trainable-block allocation strategy. Specifically,
FedBE expands trainable blocks within the model architecture, structurally
separating newly learned task-specific knowledge from the original pre-trained
representations. Additionally, FedBE dynamically assigns these trainable blocks
to clients based on their data distributions and computational capabilities.
This enables the framework to better accommodate heterogeneous federated
environments and enhances the generalization ability of the model.Extensive
experiments show that compared with existing federated fine-tuning methods,
FedBE achieves 12-74% higher accuracy retention on general tasks after
fine-tuning and a model convergence acceleration ratio of 1.9-3.1x without
degrading the accuracy of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 明确协调探索与多样性对技能学习至关重要，AMPED展示了该方法的高效性。

Abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in
environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy.
Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill
diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously
optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new
method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill
Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both exploration and skill
diversification. We begin by conducting extensive ablation studies to identify
and define a set of objectives that effectively capture the aspects of
exploration and skill diversity, respectively. During the skill pretraining
phase, AMPED introduces a gradient surgery technique to balance the objectives
of exploration and skill diversity, mitigating conflicts and reducing reliance
on heuristic tuning. In the subsequent fine-tuning phase, AMPED incorporates a
skill selector module that dynamically selects suitable skills for downstream
tasks, based on task-specific performance signals. Our approach achieves
performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and
diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and
generalizable skill learning. Project Page: https://geonwoo.me/amped/

Conclusion: DMPEL通过模块化结构和动态路由，实现了高效终身学习，同时减少存储和计算需求。

Abstract: A generalist agent must continuously learn and adapt throughout its lifetime,
achieving efficient forward transfer while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
Previous work within the dominant pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has explored
parameter-efficient fine-tuning for single-task adaptation, effectively
steering a frozen pretrained model with a small number of parameters. However,
in the context of lifelong learning, these methods rely on the impractical
assumption of a test-time task identifier and restrict knowledge sharing among
isolated adapters. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Mixture of
Progressive Parameter-Efficient Expert Library (DMPEL) for lifelong robot
learning. DMPEL progressively learn a low-rank expert library and employs a
lightweight router to dynamically combine experts into an end-to-end policy,
facilitating flexible behavior during lifelong adaptation. Moreover, by
leveraging the modular structure of the fine-tuned parameters, we introduce
coefficient replay to guide the router in accurately retrieving frozen experts
for previously encountered tasks, thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
This method is significantly more storage- and computationally-efficient than
applying demonstration replay to the entire policy. Extensive experiments on
the lifelong manipulation benchmark LIBERO demonstrate that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art lifelong learning methods in success rates across
continual adaptation, while utilizing minimal trainable parameters and storage.

Conclusion: RETENTION显著减少了CAM容量需求，为树模型加速提供了高效资源利用的方向。

Abstract: Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning
from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in
extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While
several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent
characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional
accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM)
offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing
designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work
addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework
that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model
inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning
criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which
minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation.
Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative
data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the
widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that
implementing the tree mapping scheme alone achieves $1.46\times$ to $21.30
\times$ better space efficiency, while the full RETENTION framework yields
$4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ improvement with less than 3% accuracy loss.
These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in reducing CAM
capacity requirement, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based
model acceleration.

Abstract: Self-driving labs (SDLs), employing automation and machine learning (ML) to
accelerate experimental procedures, have enormous potential in the discovery of
new materials. However, in thin film science, SDLs are mainly restricted to
solution-based synthetic methods which are easier to automate but cannot access
the broad chemical space of inorganic materials. This work presents an SDL
based on magnetron co-sputtering. We are using combinatorial frameworks,
obtaining accurate composition maps on multi-element, compositionally graded
thin films. This normally requires time-consuming ex-situ analysis prone to
systematic errors. We present a rapid and calibration-free in-situ, ML driven
approach to produce composition maps for arbitrary source combinations and
sputtering conditions. We develop a method to predict the composition
distribution in a multi-element combinatorial thin film, using in-situ
measurements from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors placed in a sputter
chamber. For a given source, the sensor readings are learned as a function of
the sputtering pressure and magnetron power, through active learning using
Gaussian processes (GPs). The final GPs are combined with a geometric model of
the deposition flux distribution in the chamber, which allows interpolation of
the deposition rates from each source, at any position across the sample. We
investigate several acquisition functions for the ML procedure. A fully
Bayesian GP - BALM (Bayesian active learning MacKay) - achieved the best
performance, learning the deposition rates for a single source in 10
experiments. Prediction accuracy for co-sputtering composition distributions
was verified experimentally. Our framework dramatically increases throughput by
avoiding the need for extensive characterisation or calibration, thus
demonstrating the potential of ML-guided SDLs to accelerate materials
exploration.

Result: 速度比有限元法快五个数量级，精度相当，且比其他深度学习基线平均提升20.47%。

Conclusion: LaDEEP在工业应用中展现出显著的准确性和效率优势。

Abstract: Scientific computing for large deformation of elastic-plastic solids is
critical for numerous real-world applications. Classical numerical solvers rely
primarily on local discrete linear approximation and are constrained by an
inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Recently, deep learning
models have achieved impressive progress in solving the continuum mechanism.
While previous models have explored various architectures and constructed
coefficient-solution mappings, they are designed for general instances without
considering specific problem properties and hard to accurately handle with
complex elastic-plastic solids involving contact, loading and unloading. In
this work, we take stretch bending, a popular metal fabrication technique, as
our case study and introduce LaDEEP, a deep learning-based surrogate model for
\textbf{La}rge \textbf{De}formation of \textbf{E}lastic-\textbf{P}lastic
Solids. We encode the partitioned regions of the involved slender solids into a
token sequence to maintain their essential order property. To characterize the
physical process of the solid deformation, a two-stage Transformer-based module
is designed to predict the deformation with the sequence of tokens as input.
Empirically, LaDEEP achieves five magnitudes faster speed than finite element
methods with a comparable accuracy, and gains 20.47\% relative improvement on
average compared to other deep learning baselines. We have also deployed our
model into a real-world industrial production system, and it has shown
remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Table reasoning (TR) requires structured reasoning over semi-structured
tabular data and remains challenging, particularly for small language models
(SLMs, e.g., LLaMA-8B) due to their limited capacity compared to large LMs
(LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o). To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR),
which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical
reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs
introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts,
and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability.
We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1
introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation
Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view.
Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization,
enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed.

Method: 理论分析和实验验证结合，具体实现了一种污染攻击方法。

Result: 污染攻击能将现有测试性能降至随机水平以下。

Conclusion: 成员推断测试仍存在漏洞，需考虑抗污染能力与准确性之间的平衡。

Abstract: Membership inference tests aim to determine whether a particular data point
was included in a language model's training set. However, recent works have
shown that such tests often fail under the strict definition of membership
based on exact matching, and have suggested relaxing this definition to include
semantic neighbors as members as well. In this work, we show that membership
inference tests are still unreliable under this relaxation - it is possible to
poison the training dataset in a way that causes the test to produce incorrect
predictions for a target point. We theoretically reveal a trade-off between a
test's accuracy and its robustness to poisoning. We also present a concrete
instantiation of this poisoning attack and empirically validate its
effectiveness. Our results show that it can degrade the performance of existing
tests to well below random.

Abstract: Existing works on general time series forecasting build foundation models
with heavy model parameters through large-scale multi-source pre-training.
These models achieve superior generalization ability across various datasets at
the cost of significant computational burdens and limitations in
resource-constrained scenarios. This paper introduces LightGTS, a lightweight
general time series forecasting model designed from the perspective of
consistent periodical modeling. To handle diverse scales and intrinsic periods
in multi-source pre-training, we introduce Periodical Tokenization, which
extracts consistent periodic patterns across different datasets with varying
scales. To better utilize the periodicity in the decoding process, we further
introduce Periodical Parallel Decoding, which leverages historical tokens to
improve forecasting. Based on the two techniques above which fully leverage the
inductive bias of periods inherent in time series, LightGTS uses a lightweight
model to achieve outstanding performance on general time series forecasting. It
achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance on 9 real-world benchmarks in
both zero-shot and full-shot settings with much better efficiency compared with
existing time series foundation models.

Result: 在七个数据集和两项复杂任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: 显式建模更适合多固体系统，能避免信息混淆。

Abstract: Multi-solid systems are foundational to a wide range of real-world
applications, yet modeling their complex interactions remains challenging.
Existing deep learning methods predominantly rely on implicit modeling, where
the factors influencing solid deformation are not explicitly represented but
are instead indirectly learned. However, as the number of solids increases,
these methods struggle to accurately capture intricate physical interactions.
In this paper, we introduce a novel explicit modeling paradigm that
incorporates factors influencing solid deformation through structured modules.
Specifically, we present Unisoma, a unified and flexible Transformer-based
model capable of handling variable numbers of solids. Unisoma directly captures
physical interactions using contact modules and adaptive interaction allocation
mechanism, and learns the deformation through a triplet relationship. Compared
to implicit modeling techniques, explicit modeling is more well-suited for
multi-solid systems with diverse coupling patterns, as it enables detailed
treatment of each solid while preventing information blending and confusion.
Experimentally, Unisoma achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across
seven well-established datasets and two complex multi-solid tasks. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究动机源于观察到的LLM训练与部署过程中与人类用户的互动可能形成类似于“回音室”的反馈循环，进而强化现有观点并削弱多样性。

Method: 通过基于代理的LLM模拟和真实GPT使用数据，作者形式化并测试了这一假说。

Result: 分析显示，新GPT版本发布后，观点多样性出现突然且持续的下降，证实了人类-AI反馈循环的存在。

Conclusion: 研究结论指出，这一反馈循环可能导致虚假信念的固化，强调了设计更开放系统的重要性。

Abstract: The training and deployment of large language models (LLMs) create a feedback
loop with human users: models learn human beliefs from data, reinforce these
beliefs with generated content, reabsorb the reinforced beliefs, and feed them
back to users again and again. This dynamic resembles an echo chamber. We
hypothesize that this feedback loop entrenches the existing values and beliefs
of users, leading to a loss of diversity and potentially the lock-in of false
beliefs. We formalize this hypothesis and test it empirically with agent-based
LLM simulations and real-world GPT usage data. Analysis reveals sudden but
sustained drops in diversity after the release of new GPT iterations,
consistent with the hypothesized human-AI feedback loop. Code and data

Conclusion: PFNs在因果效应估计中展现了潜力，为无需强假设的方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Estimation of causal effects is critical to a range of scientific
disciplines. Existing methods for this task either require interventional data,
knowledge about the ground truth causal graph, or rely on assumptions such as
unconfoundedness, restricting their applicability in real-world settings. In
the domain of tabular machine learning, Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have
achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, having been pre-trained on
synthetic data to solve tabular prediction problems via in-context learning. To
assess whether this can be transferred to the harder problem of causal effect
estimation, we pre-train PFNs on synthetic data drawn from a wide variety of
causal structures, including interventions, to predict interventional outcomes
given observational data. Through extensive experiments on synthetic case
studies, we show that our approach allows for the accurate estimation of causal
effects without knowledge of the underlying causal graph. We also perform
ablation studies that elucidate Do-PFN's scalability and robustness across
datasets with a variety of causal characteristics.

Result: 在8B参数模型上仅用100B数据微调，推理和编码任务相对性能提升约10%。

Conclusion: RPT能有效减少错误累积且兼容现有模型，显著提升任务表现。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models accumulate errors due to their fixed,
irrevocable left-to-right token generation. To address this, we propose a new
sampling method called Resample-Previous-Tokens (RPT). RPT mitigates error
accumulation by iteratively revisiting and potentially replacing tokens in a
window of previously generated text. This method can be integrated into
existing autoregressive models, preserving their next-token-prediction quality
and speed. Fine-tuning a pretrained 8B parameter model with RPT for only 100B
resulted in ~10% relative improvements on reasoning and coding benchmarks
compared to the standard sampling.

Conclusion: ROBIN通过集成滚动扩散和分层图神经网络，显著提升模拟器的全局现象捕捉能力和计算效率。

Abstract: Graph-based learned simulators have emerged as a promising approach for
simulating physical systems on unstructured meshes, offering speed and
generalization across diverse geometries. However, they often struggle with
capturing global phenomena, such as bending or long-range correlations, and
suffer from error accumulation over long rollouts due to their reliance on
local message passing and direct next-step prediction. We address these
limitations by introducing the Rolling Diffusion-Batched Inference Network
(ROBIN), a novel learned simulator that integrates two key innovations: (i)
Rolling Diffusion, a parallelized inference scheme that amortizes the cost of
diffusion-based refinement across physical time steps by overlapping denoising
steps across a temporal window. (ii) A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network built
on algebraic multigrid coarsening, enabling multiscale message passing across
different mesh resolutions. This architecture, implemented via
Algebraic-hierarchical Message Passing Networks, captures both fine-scale local
dynamics and global structural effects critical for phenomena like beam bending
or multi-body contact. We validate ROBIN on challenging 2D and 3D solid
mechanics benchmarks involving geometric, material, and contact nonlinearities.
ROBIN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all tasks, substantially
outperforming existing next-step learned simulators while reducing inference
time by up to an order of magnitude compared to standard diffusion simulators.

Motivation: 传统不确定性估计方法（如dropout）在区分可靠与不可靠预测时表现不佳，主要由于分类器权重的噪声影响了细粒度统计信息的有效性。

Method: 提出了一种测试时优化方法，通过定义单调子集选择函数，考虑噪声影响，提升置信度估计的可靠性。

Result: 该方法在AUSE和AURC等风险度量中表现优异，能有效区分训练与测试分布的差异、ID与OOD样本，并揭示CNN与ViT分类器的关键差异。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了不确定性估计的可靠性，适用于多种视觉数据集，展示了广泛的实用价值。

Abstract: Standard uncertainty estimation techniques, such as dropout, often struggle
to clearly distinguish reliable predictions from unreliable ones. We attribute
this limitation to noisy classifier weights, which, while not impairing overall
class-level predictions, render finer-level statistics less informative. To
address this, we propose a novel test-time optimization method that accounts
for the impact of such noise to produce more reliable confidence estimates.
This score defines a monotonic subset-selection function, where population
accuracy consistently increases as samples with lower scores are removed, and
it demonstrates superior performance in standard risk-based metrics such as
AUSE and AURC. Additionally, our method effectively identifies discrepancies
between training and test distributions, reliably differentiates
in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples, and elucidates key
differences between CNN and ViT classifiers across various vision datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统的机器学习遗忘定义过于严格，要求更新后的模型与新训练模型几乎一致，导致开发高效遗忘算法困难。本文针对现实中的攻击者能力较弱的情况，提出了更实用的系统感知遗忘定义。

Method: 首先定义了系统感知遗忘的概念，随后针对线性分类提出了一种选择性采样方法的具体算法，并将其推广到更一般的函数类别。理论分析了删除容量、准确性、内存和计算时间之间的权衡。

Result: 提出的系统感知遗忘算法能够在保证安全性的同时，显著提高遗忘效率。理论分析展示了不同资源之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 系统感知遗忘为机器学习模型提供了更实用的保护机制，解决了传统遗忘定义过于严格的问题，并通过选择性采样算法实现了高效的遗忘更新。

Abstract: Machine unlearning addresses the problem of updating a machine learning
model/system trained on a dataset $S$ so that the influence of a set of
deletion requests $U \subseteq S$ on the unlearned model is minimized. The gold
standard definition of unlearning demands that the updated model, after
deletion, be nearly identical to the model obtained by retraining. This
definition is designed for a worst-case attacker (one who can recover not only
the unlearned model but also the remaining data samples, i.e., $S \setminus
U$). Such a stringent definition has made developing efficient unlearning
algorithms challenging. However, such strong attackers are also unrealistic. In
this work, we propose a new definition, system-aware unlearning, which aims to
provide unlearning guarantees against an attacker that can at best only gain
access to the data stored in the system for learning/unlearning requests and
not all of $S\setminus U$. With this new definition, we use the simple
intuition that if a system can store less to make its learning/unlearning
updates, it can be more secure and update more efficiently against a
system-aware attacker. Towards that end, we present an exact system-aware
unlearning algorithm for linear classification using a selective sampling-based
approach, and we generalize the method for classification with general function
classes. We theoretically analyze the tradeoffs between deletion capacity,
accuracy, memory, and computation time.

Conclusion: STOF通过灵活掩码和算子融合，有效提升了稀疏Transformer的性能，为相关研究提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Large language models are popular around the world due to their powerful
understanding capabilities. As the core component of LLMs, accelerating
Transformer through parallelization has gradually become a hot research topic.
Mask layers introduce sparsity into Transformer to reduce calculations.
However, previous works rarely focus on the performance optimization of sparse
Transformer. Moreover, rule-based mechanisms ignore the fusion opportunities of
mixed-type operators and fail to adapt to various sequence lengths. To address
the above problems, we propose STOF, a framework that incorporates
optimizations for Sparse Transformer via flexible masking and operator fusion
on GPU. We firstly unify the storage format and kernel implementation for the
multi-head attention. Then, we map fusion schemes to compilation templates and
determine the optimal parameter setting through a two-stage search engine. The
experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art work, STOF
achieves maximum speedups of 1.7x in MHA computation and 1.5x in end-to-end
inference.

Conclusion: T2L为简化基础模型的个性化适配提供了高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: While Foundation Models provide a general tool for rapid content creation,
they regularly require task-specific adaptation. Traditionally, this exercise
involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the
underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt
foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy
training while being notably sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting
Large Language Models on the fly solely based on a natural language description
of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a
single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained
LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA
instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the
corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA
instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach
provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of
foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute
requirements. Our code is available at https://github.com/SakanaAI/text-to-lora

Abstract: Growing concerns over data privacy and security highlight the importance of
machine unlearning--removing specific data influences from trained models
without full retraining. Techniques like Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)
are widely used to externally assess successful unlearning. However, existing
methods face two key limitations: (1) maximizing MIA effectiveness (e.g., via
online attacks) requires prohibitive computational resources, often exceeding
retraining costs; (2) MIAs, designed for binary inclusion tests, struggle to
capture granular changes in approximate unlearning. To address these
challenges, we propose the Interpolated Approximate Measurement (IAM), a
framework natively designed for unlearning inference. IAM quantifies
sample-level unlearning completeness by interpolating the model's
generalization-fitting behavior gap on queried samples. IAM achieves strong
performance in binary inclusion tests for exact unlearning and high correlation
for approximate unlearning--scalable to LLMs using just one pre-trained shadow
model. We theoretically analyze how IAM's scoring mechanism maintains
performance efficiently. We then apply IAM to recent approximate unlearning
algorithms, revealing general risks of both over-unlearning and
under-unlearning, underscoring the need for stronger safeguards in approximate
unlearning systems. The code is available at

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection is critical for improving clustering

$k$-means++, a novel initialisation strategy for the Minkowski Weighted
$k$-means. Our initialisation selects centroids probabilistically using feature
relevance estimates derived from the data itself. Building on this, we propose
two new feature selection algorithms, FS-MWK++, which aggregates feature
weights across a range of Minkowski exponents to identify stable and

We support our approach with a theoretical guarantee under mild assumptions and

Conclusion: 流注意力机制通过考虑守恒定律，增强了 GNNs 的表现力和区分力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential for learning from
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs do not consider the conservation
law inherent in graphs associated with a flow of physical resources, such as
electrical current in power grids or traffic in transportation networks, which
can lead to reduced model performance. To address this, we propose flow
attention, which adapts existing graph attention mechanisms to satisfy
Kirchhoff\'s first law. Furthermore, we discuss how this modification
influences the expressivity and identify sets of non-isomorphic graphs that can
be discriminated by flow attention but not by standard attention. Through
extensive experiments on two flow graph datasets (electronic circuits and power
grids), we demonstrate that flow attention enhances the performance of
attention-based GNNs on both graph-level classification and regression tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在多任务深度学习（MTDL）中，多个任务可能产生相互冲突的梯度，导致学习过程受阻。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了一种基于梯度幅度相似性的新方法。

Method: 论文提出了相似性感知动量梯度手术（SAM-GS），通过梯度均衡化和一阶动量的调制来调整梯度轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，SAM-GS在合成问题和MTL基准测试中表现有效，梯度幅度相似性在优化学习过程中起到了关键作用。

Conclusion: SAM-GS是一种有效且可扩展的方法，能够显著改善多任务深度学习中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: The multi-task learning ($MTL$) paradigm aims to simultaneously learn
multiple tasks within a single model capturing higher-level, more general
hidden patterns that are shared by the tasks. In deep learning, a significant
challenge in the backpropagation training process is the design of advanced
optimisers to improve the convergence speed and stability of the gradient
descent learning rule. In particular, in multi-task deep learning ($MTDL$) the
multitude of tasks may generate potentially conflicting gradients that would
hinder the concurrent convergence of the diverse loss functions. This challenge
arises when the gradients of the task objectives have either different
magnitudes or opposite directions, causing one or a few to dominate or to
interfere with each other, thus degrading the training process. Gradient
surgery methods address the problem explicitly dealing with conflicting
gradients by adjusting the overall gradient trajectory. This work introduces a
novel gradient surgery method, the Similarity-Aware Momentum Gradient Surgery
(SAM-GS), which provides an effective and scalable approach based on a gradient
magnitude similarity measure to guide the optimisation process. The SAM-GS
surgery adopts gradient equalisation and modulation of the first-order
momentum. A series of experimental tests have shown the effectiveness of SAM-GS
on synthetic problems and $MTL$ benchmarks. Gradient magnitude similarity plays
a crucial role in regularising gradient aggregation in $MTDL$ for the
optimisation of the learning process.

Conclusion: carps框架为HPO方法的标准化评估迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is crucial to develop well-performing
machine learning models. In order to ease prototyping and benchmarking of HPO
methods, we propose carps, a benchmark framework for Comprehensive Automated
Research Performance Studies allowing to evaluate N optimizers on M benchmark
tasks. In this first release of carps, we focus on the four most important
types of HPO task types: blackbox, multi-fidelity, multi-objective and
multi-fidelity-multi-objective. With 3 336 tasks from 5 community benchmark
collections and 28 variants of 9 optimizer families, we offer the biggest go-to
library to date to evaluate and compare HPO methods. The carps framework relies
on a purpose-built, lightweight interface, gluing together optimizers and
benchmark tasks. It also features an analysis pipeline, facilitating the
evaluation of optimizers on benchmarks. However, navigating a huge number of
tasks while developing and comparing methods can be computationally infeasible.
To address this, we obtain a subset of representative tasks by minimizing the
star discrepancy of the subset, in the space spanned by the full set. As a
result, we propose an initial subset of 10 to 30 diverse tasks for each task
type, and include functionality to re-compute subsets as more benchmarks become
available, enabling efficient evaluations. We also establish a first set of
baseline results on these tasks as a measure for future comparisons. With carps
(https://www.github.com/automl/CARP-S), we make an important step in the
standardization of HPO evaluation.

Conclusion: ENMA提供了一个鲁棒且适应性强的框架，能够处理复杂的时空动态预测问题。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent parametric partial differential equations (PDEs)
remains a fundamental challenge for neural solvers, particularly when
generalizing across a wide range of physical parameters and dynamics. When data
is uncertain or incomplete-as is often the case-a natural approach is to turn
to generative models. We introduce ENMA, a generative neural operator designed
to model spatio-temporal dynamics arising from physical phenomena. ENMA
predicts future dynamics in a compressed latent space using a generative masked
autoregressive transformer trained with flow matching loss, enabling tokenwise
generation. Irregularly sampled spatial observations are encoded into uniform
latent representations via attention mechanisms and further compressed through
a spatio-temporal convolutional encoder. This allows ENMA to perform in-context
learning at inference time by conditioning on either past states of the target
trajectory or auxiliary context trajectories with similar dynamics. The result
is a robust and adaptable framework that generalizes to new PDE regimes and
supports one-shot surrogate modeling of time-dependent parametric PDEs.

Motivation: PG方法依赖于新鲜数据，导致样本效率低下。传统方法重用梯度信息已有研究，但轨迹数据的重用缺乏理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出RPG算法，结合新旧轨迹进行策略更新，并引入幂均值校正的多重要性加权估计器。

Result: 在理论分析中，RPG实现了$	ext{}O(\epsilon^{-1})$的样本复杂度，是目前文献中最优的速率。实证验证也表明其优于现有PG方法。

Conclusion: 通过重用旧轨迹数据，RPG显著提高了PG方法的效率，理论上和实证上都取得了最佳表现。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are a class of effective reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly when dealing with continuous control problems. These
methods learn the parameters of parametric policies via stochastic gradient
ascent, typically using on-policy trajectory data to estimate the policy
gradient. However, such reliance on fresh data makes them sample-inefficient.
Indeed, vanilla PG methods require $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ trajectories to reach an
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary point. A common strategy to improve
efficiency is to reuse off-policy information from past iterations, such as
previous gradients or trajectories. While gradient reuse has received
substantial theoretical attention, leading to improved rates of
$O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, the reuse of past trajectories remains largely unexplored
from a theoretical perspective. In this work, we provide the first rigorous
theoretical evidence that extensive reuse of past off-policy trajectories can
significantly accelerate convergence in PG methods. We introduce a power mean
correction to the multiple importance weighting estimator and propose RPG
(Retrospective Policy Gradient), a PG algorithm that combines old and new
trajectories for policy updates. Through a novel analysis, we show that, under
established assumptions, RPG achieves a sample complexity of
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, the best known rate in the literature. We
further validate empirically our approach against PG methods with
state-of-the-art rates.

Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural
architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper,
we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from
agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences,
and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent,
learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including
out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as
a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of
interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide
variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical
insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns
interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce
HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn
couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities.
Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond
pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way,
four-way, or general n-way interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的训练无关、模型无关且无运行时开销的框架，为扩散模型的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion
models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets,
text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we
find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields
strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine
experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the
learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up
to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this
negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity
in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening
uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when
estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the
two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further
improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic,
and adds no runtime overhead.

Conclusion: PINC框架为流体流动监控与优化提供了高效的无标签数据解决方案。

Abstract: The modeling and control of single-phase flow systems governed by Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs) present challenges, especially under transient
conditions. In this work, we extend the Physics-Informed Neural Nets for
Control (PINC) framework, originally proposed to modeling and control of
Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) without the need of any labeled data, to
the PDE case, particularly to single-phase incompressible and compressible
flows, integrating neural networks with physical conservation laws. The PINC
model for PDEs is structured into two stages: a steady-state network, which
learns equilibrium solutions for a wide range of control inputs, and a
transient network, which captures dynamic responses under time-varying boundary
conditions. We propose a simplifying assumption that reduces the dimensionality
of the spatial coordinate regarding the initial condition, allowing the
efficient training of the PINC network. This simplification enables the
derivation of optimal control policies using Model Predictive Control (MPC). We
validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that the
PINC model, which is trained exclusively using physical laws, i.e., without
labeled data, accurately represents flow dynamics and enables real-time control
applications. The results highlight the PINC's capability to efficiently
approximate PDE solutions without requiring iterative solvers, making it a
promising alternative for fluid flow monitoring and optimization in engineering
applications.

Abstract: Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is
essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and
treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from
intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be
leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal
Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using
three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark
is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to
measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease
groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and
several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to
generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient
trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can
rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a
challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of
the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the
practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for
assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and
benchmark are fully reproducible and available at

Abstract: While conservation laws in gradient flow training dynamics are well
understood for (mostly shallow) ReLU and linear networks, their study remains
largely unexplored for more practical architectures. This paper bridges this
gap by deriving and analyzing conservation laws for modern architectures, with
a focus on convolutional ResNets and Transformer networks. For this, we first
show that basic building blocks such as ReLU (or linear) shallow networks, with
or without convolution, have easily expressed conservation laws, and no more
than the known ones. In the case of a single attention layer, we also
completely describe all conservation laws, and we show that residual blocks
have the same conservation laws as the same block without a skip connection. We
then introduce the notion of conservation laws that depend only on a subset of
parameters (corresponding e.g. to a pair of consecutive layers, to a residual
block, or to an attention layer). We demonstrate that the characterization of
such laws can be reduced to the analysis of the corresponding building block in
isolation. Finally, we examine how these newly discovered conservation
principles, initially established in the continuous gradient flow regime,
persist under discrete optimization dynamics, particularly in the context of
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

Conclusion: 该方法首次在低精度稳态数值模拟中实现了对时变风况的通用尾流导向控制。

Abstract: Within wind farms, wake effects between turbines can significantly reduce
overall energy production. Wind farm flow control encompasses methods designed
to mitigate these effects through coordinated turbine control. Wake steering,
for example, consists in intentionally misaligning certain turbines with the
wind to optimize airflow and increase power output. However, designing a robust
wake steering controller remains challenging, and existing machine learning
approaches are limited to quasi-static wind conditions or small wind farms.
This work presents a new deep reinforcement learning methodology to develop a
wake steering policy that overcomes these limitations. Our approach introduces
a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks and multi-head
self-attention blocks, alongside a novel reward function and training strategy.
The resulting model computes the yaw angles of each turbine, optimizing energy
production in time-varying wind conditions. An empirical study conducted on
steady-state, low-fidelity simulation, shows that our model requires
approximately 10 times fewer training steps than a fully connected neural
network and achieves more robust performance compared to a strong optimization
baseline, increasing energy production by up to 14 %. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first deep reinforcement learning-based wake steering
controller to generalize effectively across any time-varying wind conditions in
a low-fidelity, steady-state numerical simulation setting.

Conclusion: MGCL证明了将生成模型融入GCL的优势，为无监督图表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{MGCL}$, a model-driven graph contrastive learning (GCL)
framework that leverages graphons (probabilistic generative models for graphs)
to guide contrastive learning by accounting for the data's underlying
generative process. GCL has emerged as a powerful self-supervised framework for
learning expressive node or graph representations without relying on annotated
labels, which are often scarce in real-world data. By contrasting augmented
views of graph data, GCL has demonstrated strong performance across various
downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually designed or heuristic augmentation
strategies that are not tailored to the underlying data distribution and
operate at the individual graph level, ignoring similarities among graphs
generated from the same model. Conversely, in our proposed approach, MGCL first
estimates the graphon associated with the observed data and then defines a
graphon-informed augmentation process, enabling data-adaptive and principled
augmentations. Additionally, for graph-level tasks, MGCL clusters the dataset
and estimates a graphon per group, enabling contrastive pairs to reflect shared
semantics and structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of incorporating generative models into GCL.

Abstract: While several feature embedding models have been developed in the literature,
comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The code is available at

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent mental health
condition, and a deeper understanding of its neurocognitive foundations is
essential for identifying how core functions such as emotional and
self-referential processing are affected. We investigate how depression alters
the temporal dynamics of emotional processing by measuring neural responses to
self-referential affective sentences using surface electroencephalography (EEG)
in healthy and depressed individuals. Our results reveal significant
group-level differences in neural activity during sentence viewing, suggesting
disrupted integration of emotional and self-referential information in
depression. Deep learning model trained on these responses achieves an area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.707 in distinguishing healthy
from depressed participants, and 0.624 in differentiating depressed subgroups
with and without suicidal ideation. Spatial ablations highlight anterior
electrodes associated with semantic and affective processing as key
contributors. These findings suggest stable, stimulus-driven neural signatures
of depression that may inform future diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a learning algorithm for training
Energy-based Models (EBMs) on static inputs which leverages the variational
description of their fixed points. Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a
challenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire
system trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of
boundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized
Lagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational
formulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields
different learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the
system, many of which are impractical for implementation. We then show that
Hamiltonian Echo Learning (HEL) -- which includes the recently proposed
Recurrent HEL (RHEL) and the earlier known Hamiltonian Echo Backpropagation
(HEB) algorithms -- can be derived as a special case of GLEP. Notably, HEL is
the only instance of GLEP we found that inherits the properties that make EP a
desirable alternative to backpropagation for hardware implementations: it
operates in a "forward-only" manner (i.e. using the same system for both
inference and learning), it scales efficiently (requiring only two or more
passes through the system regardless of model size), and enables local
learning.

TL;DR: 当前LLM遗忘方法的鲁棒性不足，容易被微调恢复。研究发现，将遗忘模型蒸馏到随机初始化的学生模型能保留期望行为并去除不期望能力，提出了UNDO方法，通过部分噪声蒸馏实现鲁棒遗忘。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法容易通过微调恢复，无法真正实现鲁棒遗忘，尤其是在输出微调的情况下。亟需一种高效且鲁棒的遗忘方法。

Method: 提出UNDO方法，通过将遗忘模型蒸馏到其部分噪声副本中，引入可调计算成本与鲁棒性的权衡，实现高效鲁棒的遗忘。

Result: 在最强设置下，UNDO匹配了从头训练的鲁棒性，仅需60-80%的计算成本且仅标记0.01%的预训练数据。在WMDP基准上也表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 蒸馏能显著提升遗忘的鲁棒性，UNDO为实践中实现有效能力移除提供了便利路径。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods are not robust: they can be reverted easily
with a few steps of finetuning. This is true even for the idealized unlearning
method of training to imitate an oracle model that was never exposed to
unwanted information, suggesting that output-based finetuning is insufficient
to achieve robust unlearning. In a similar vein, we find that training a
randomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired
behaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,
distillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose
Unlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an
unlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a
tunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto
frontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks. At its strongest setting,
UNDO matches the robustness of a model retrained from scratch with perfect data
filtering while using only 60-80% of the compute and requiring only 0.01% of
the pretraining data to be labeled. We also show that UNDO robustifies
unlearning on the more realistic Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP)
benchmark. Since distillation is widely used in practice, incorporating an
unlearning step beforehand offers a convenient path to robust capability
removal.

Motivation: 特征谱分析中权重矩阵纵横比会影响重尾度量估计的准确性，需要一种方法来消除这种偏差。

Method: 提出FARMS方法，通过固定纵横比子矩阵采样并分析其平均特征谱密度，以消除纵横比带来的偏差。

Result: FARMS在各种应用领域（如图像分类、科学机器学习和大语言模型修剪）中均提升了特征谱分析准确性，并在LLaMA-7B模型修剪中降低了困惑度17.3%。

Conclusion: FARMS方法有效解决了特征谱分析中的纵横比偏差问题，具有广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Diagnosing deep neural networks (DNNs) through the eigenspectrum of weight
matrices has been an active area of research in recent years. At a high level,
eigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the
empirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into
how well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better
layer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge
associated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of
weight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that
matrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias
in estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose
FARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the
weight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead
of measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD
of these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of
these submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the
aspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization
techniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of
weights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,
scientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model
(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly
improves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective
layer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of
the LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model
by 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method.

Method: 采用基础形式本体论（BFO）和其他应用本体论方法，区分爱的不同意义，并通过因果关联模型连接情感与认知成分。

Result: 提出爱的本体论表征，平衡其非理性和理性方面，为形式化研究及AI应用提供基础。

Conclusion: 爱的本体论分析为跨学科研究（如人工智能和科学）开辟了新方向，强调其形式和可扩展性。

Abstract: This work lays the foundations for a rigorous ontological characterization of
love, addressing its philosophical complexity and scientific relevance, with
particular emphasis on psychology and sociology, as well as highlighting ways
in which such characterization enhances relevant AI based applications. The
position defended here is that love is best understood as a concatenation of
passive sensations (e.g., emotional arousal) and active evaluative judgments
(e.g., perceiving the beloved as valuable), in the interest of balancing the
involuntary aspects of love with its rational accountability. To provide a
structured foundation, the paper draws on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and other
applied ontological methods to differentiate various senses of love. This work
engages with objections to the understanding of love as concatenation,
particularly concerning the relationship between sensation and judgment. A
causal correlation model is defended, ensuring that the affective and cognitive
components are linked. By offering a precise and scalable ontological account,
this work lays the foundation for future interdisciplinary applications, making
love a subject of formal inquiry in ontology engineering, artificial
intelligence, and the sciences.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 当前生成式AI系统在组织环境中快速部署，但由于缺乏完整的上下文记忆能力，导致重复错误和决策不透明。

Method: 通过结合认知科学、组织理论等，CMI提出了结构化捕获、推断和再生上下文的框架，并引入Insight Layer模块化架构，包括人机协同反思、漂移检测和理由保留。

Result: CMI能够帮助系统基于数据、历史、判断和变化上下文进行推理，解决了当前AI架构和治理的基础盲点。

Conclusion: CMI为构建有效、可反思、可审计且社会责任的智能系统提供了框架，增强了人机协作、生成式AI设计和机构韧性。

Abstract: A critical challenge remains unresolved as generative AI systems are quickly
implemented in various organizational settings. Despite significant advances in
memory components such as RAG, vector stores, and LLM agents, these systems
still have substantial memory limitations. Gen AI workflows rarely store or
reflect on the full context in which decisions are made. This leads to repeated
errors and a general lack of clarity. This paper introduces Contextual Memory
Intelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent
systems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for
longitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather
than passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,
human-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured
capture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system
capability. The Insight Layer is presented in this paper to operationalize this
vision. This modular architecture uses human-in-the-loop reflection, drift
detection, and rationale preservation to incorporate contextual memory into
systems. The paper argues that CMI allows systems to reason with data, history,
judgment, and changing context, thereby addressing a foundational blind spot in
current AI architectures and governance efforts. A framework for creating
intelligent systems that are effective, reflective, auditable, and socially
responsible is presented through CMI. This enhances human-AI collaboration,
generative AI design, and the resilience of the institutions.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖概率探索，可能导致不安全或无效的过渡，而逻辑推理框架能确保每一步的可验证性和安全性。

Method: 用逻辑命题表示动作、转移和目标，通过直觉逻辑构建构造性证明，确保策略和状态转移的可验证性。在结构化网格世界中实现符号化代理。

Result: 与Q学习相比，该方法实现了零无效动作、完美安全性、可解释行为和高效收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习提供了基于逻辑和证明理论的新方向，适用于安全规划和可信AI。

Abstract: We introduce a novel learning and planning framework that replaces
traditional reward-based optimisation with constructive logical inference. In
our model, actions, transitions, and goals are represented as logical
propositions, and decision-making proceeds by building constructive proofs
under intuitionistic logic. This method ensures that state transitions and
policies are accepted only when supported by verifiable preconditions --
eschewing probabilistic trial-and-error in favour of guaranteed logical
validity. We implement a symbolic agent operating in a structured gridworld,
where reaching a goal requires satisfying a chain of intermediate subgoals
(e.g., collecting keys to open doors), each governed by logical constraints.
Unlike conventional reinforcement learning agents, which require extensive
exploration and suffer from unsafe or invalid transitions, our constructive
agent builds a provably correct plan through goal chaining, condition tracking,
and knowledge accumulation. Empirical comparison with Q-learning demonstrates
that our method achieves perfect safety, interpretable behaviour, and efficient
convergence with no invalid actions, highlighting its potential for safe
planning, symbolic cognition, and trustworthy AI. This work presents a new
direction for reinforcement learning grounded not in numeric optimisation, but
in constructive logic and proof theory.

Result: 实际验证中，BSDS加速了数据驱动项目的上市时间，提升了跨部门协作，并为各种规模企业提供了可扩展的方案。

Conclusion: BSDS通过动态数据系统设计解决了业务与技术的脱节问题，未来可基于复杂系统理论进一步优化。

Abstract: Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid
adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data
platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business
needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose
the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a
holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization
to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated
by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of
business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of
organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated
data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents,
and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with
data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving
scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows
optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements,
balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is
its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with
business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and
business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates
time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional
collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes.
Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using
complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous
data systems leveraging AI agents.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决强化学习算法中终端状态（如死亡）缺乏直接反馈的问题，通过生物学灵感设计内在奖励函数。

Method: 采用记忆增强神经网络（MANN）架构生成内在奖励，模拟恐惧条件反射行为，并在Miniworld Sidewalk环境中验证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效避免非描述性终端条件（如死亡），并展示了与广泛性焦虑障碍（GADs）相关的行为范围。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种生物启发的神经网络架构和恐惧条件反射框架，为稀疏奖励环境中的智能体行为设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Biological and psychological concepts have inspired reinforcement learning
algorithms to create new complex behaviors that expand agents' capacity. These
behaviors can be seen in the rise of techniques like goal decomposition,
curriculum, and intrinsic rewards, which have paved the way for these complex
behaviors. One limitation in evaluating these methods is the requirement for
engineered extrinsic for realistic environments. A central challenge in
engineering the necessary reward function(s) comes from these environments
containing states that carry high negative rewards, but provide no feedback to
the agent. Death is one such stimuli that fails to provide direct feedback to
the agent. In this work, we introduce an intrinsic reward function inspired by
early amygdala development and produce this intrinsic reward through a novel
memory-augmented neural network (MANN) architecture. We show how this intrinsic
motivation serves to deter exploration of terminal states and results in
avoidance behavior similar to fear conditioning observed in animals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how modifying a threshold where the fear response
is active produces a range of behaviors that are described under the paradigm
of general anxiety disorders (GADs). We demonstrate this behavior in the
Miniworld Sidewalk environment, which provides a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) and a sparse reward with a non-descriptive terminal
condition, i.e., death. In effect, this study results in a
biologically-inspired neural architecture and framework for fear conditioning
paradigms; we empirically demonstrate avoidance behavior in a constructed agent
that is able to solve environments with non-descriptive terminal conditions.

Result: 模型基准性能与协作结果相关但存在不一致性和显著异常值，表明知识迁移需专门优化。

Conclusion: 知识迁移需专门优化，行为与策略因素是成功的关键。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI reasoning have driven substantial improvements
across diverse tasks. A critical open question is whether these improvements
also yields better knowledge transfer: the ability of models to communicate
reasoning in ways humans can understand, apply, and learn from. To investigate
this, we introduce Knowledge Integration and Transfer Evaluation (KITE), a
conceptual and experimental framework for Human-AI knowledge transfer
capabilities and conduct the first large-scale human study (N=118) explicitly
designed to measure it. In our two-phase setup, humans first ideate with an AI
on problem-solving strategies, then independently implement solutions,
isolating model explanations' influence on human understanding. Our findings
reveal that although model benchmark performance correlates with collaborative
outcomes, this relationship is notably inconsistent, featuring significant
outliers, indicating that knowledge transfer requires dedicated optimization.
Our analysis identifies behavioral and strategic factors mediating successful
knowledge transfer. We release our code, dataset, and evaluation framework to
support future work on communicatively aligned models.

Motivation: 表格和基于表格的应用在现实中至关重要，但相关评估主要集中在NL-to-SQL和Table-QA等狭窄任务上，忽视了专业用户面临的广泛任务。MMTU旨在填补这一差距，推动结构化数据处理模型的发展。

Method: MMTU通过25个真实世界表格任务和30K问题，测试模型的表格理解、推理和编程能力。任务源自几十年计算机科学研究的表格数据，专注于专业用户面临的复杂任务。

Result: 当前前沿模型（如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1）在MMTU上的表现仅约60%，表明其表格处理能力仍有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: MMTU为表格任务的全面评估提供了新基准，揭示了当前模型的不足，为未来模型发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and

Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal
materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to
perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow
planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we
propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as
MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a
Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to
generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator
synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a
force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator
coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures
robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning,
physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials
discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in
stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models
when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across
diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous
materials discovery.

Result: 方法在表格推荐任务和大规模语言模型对齐中验证了有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 新框架能够更公平地反映评估者偏好分布，同时满足社会选择理论的核心公理。

Abstract: Conventional preference learning methods often prioritize opinions held more
widely when aggregating preferences from multiple evaluators. This may result
in policies that are biased in favor of some types of opinions or groups. The
objective of this paper is to develop a novel preference learning framework
capable of aligning aggregate opinions and policies proportionally with the
true population distribution of evaluator preferences. Our approach infers the
feasible set of evaluator population distributions directly from pairwise
comparison data. Using these estimates, the algorithm constructs a policy that
satisfies foundational axioms from social choice theory, namely monotonicity
and Pareto efficiency, as well as our newly-introduced axioms of
population-proportional representation and population-bounded robustness. We
propose a soft-max relaxation method that smoothly trade-offs
population-proportional representation with the selection of the Condorcet
winner (which beats all other options in pairwise comparisons). Finally, we
validate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments
on both tabular recommendation tasks and large-scale language model alignment.

Abstract: Recent large-scale reasoning models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on challenging mathematical benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
underlying their success remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce
the notion of a reasoning graph, extracted by clustering hidden-state
representations at each reasoning step, and systematically analyze three key
graph-theoretic properties: cyclicity, diameter, and small-world index, across
multiple tasks (GSM8K, MATH500, AIME 2024). Our findings reveal that distilled
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B) exhibit significantly
more recurrent cycles (about 5 per sample), substantially larger graph
diameters, and pronounced small-world characteristics (about 6x) compared to
their base counterparts. Notably, these structural advantages grow with task
difficulty and model capacity, with cycle detection peaking at the 14B scale
and exploration diameter maximized in the 32B variant, correlating positively
with accuracy. Furthermore, we show that supervised fine-tuning on an improved
dataset systematically expands reasoning graph diameters in tandem with
performance gains, offering concrete guidelines for dataset design aimed at
boosting reasoning capabilities. By bridging theoretical insights into
reasoning graph structures with practical recommendations for data
construction, our work advances both the interpretability and the efficacy of
large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but typically
generate lengthy sequential chains-of-thought, resulting in long inference
times before arriving at the final answer. To address this challenge, we
introduce SPRINT, a novel post-training and inference-time framework designed
to enable LRMs to dynamically identify and exploit opportunities for
parallelization during their reasoning process. SPRINT incorporates an
innovative data curation pipeline that reorganizes natural language reasoning
trajectories into structured rounds of long-horizon planning and parallel
execution. By fine-tuning LRMs on a small amount of such curated data, the
models learn to dynamically identify independent subtasks within extended
reasoning processes and effectively execute them in parallel. Through extensive
evaluations, we show that the models fine-tuned with the SPRINT framework match
the performance of reasoning models on complex domains such as mathematics
while generating up to ~39% fewer sequential tokens on problems requiring more
than 8000 output tokens. Finally, we observe consistent results transferred to
two out-of-distribution tasks of GPQA and Countdown with up to 45% and 65%
reduction in average sequential tokens for longer reasoning trajectories, while
achieving the performance of the fine-tuned reasoning model.

Abstract: Constrained decoding enables Language Models (LMs) to produce samples that
provably satisfy hard constraints. However, existing constrained-decoding
approaches often distort the underlying model distribution, a limitation that
is especially problematic in applications like program fuzzing, where one wants
to generate diverse and valid program inputs for testing purposes. We propose a
new constrained sampling framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
that simultaneously satisfies three core desiderata: constraint satisfying
(every sample satisfies the constraint), monotonically converging (the sampling
process converges to the true conditional distribution), and efficient
(high-quality samples emerge in few steps). Our method constructs a proposal
distribution over valid outputs and applies a Metropolis-Hastings acceptance
criterion based on the LM's likelihood, ensuring principled and efficient
exploration of the constrained space. Empirically, our sampler outperforms
existing methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world program fuzzing
tasks.

Abstract: Complex interactions among agents present a significant challenge for
autonomous driving in real-world scenarios. Recently, a promising approach has
emerged, which formulates the interactions of agents as a level-k game
framework. It effectively decouples agent policies by hierarchical game levels.
However, this framework ignores both the varying driving complexities among
agents and the dynamic changes in agent states across game levels, instead
treating them uniformly. Consequently, redundant and error-prone computations
are introduced into this framework. To tackle the issue, this paper proposes a
metric, termed as Trajectory Entropy, to reveal the game status of agents
within the level-k game framework. The key insight stems from recognizing the
inherit relationship between agent policy uncertainty and the associated
driving complexity. Specifically, Trajectory Entropy extracts statistical
signals representing uncertainty from the multimodality trajectory prediction
results of agents in the game. Then, the signal-to-noise ratio of this signal
is utilized to quantify the game status of agents. Based on the proposed
Trajectory Entropy, we refine the current level-k game framework through a
simple gating mechanism, significantly improving overall accuracy while
reducing computational costs. Our method is evaluated on the Waymo and nuPlan
datasets, in terms of trajectory prediction, open-loop and closed-loop planning
tasks. The results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with precision improved by up to 19.89% for prediction and up to 16.48% for
planning.

Abstract: The growing application of artificial intelligence in sensitive domains has
intensified the demand for systems that are not only accurate but also
explainable and trustworthy. Although explainable AI (XAI) methods have
proliferated, many do not consider the diverse audiences that interact with AI
systems: from developers and domain experts to end-users and society. This
paper addresses how trust in AI is influenced by the design and delivery of
explanations and proposes a multilevel framework that aligns explanations with
the epistemic, contextual, and ethical expectations of different stakeholders.
The framework consists of three layers: algorithmic and domain-based,
human-centered, and social explainability. We highlight the emerging role of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing the social layer by generating
accessible, natural language explanations. Through illustrative case studies,
we demonstrate how this approach facilitates technical fidelity, user
engagement, and societal accountability, reframing XAI as a dynamic,
trust-building process.

a large-scale synthetic dialogue dataset spanning multiple domains. Second, we
develop a suite of automatic evaluation metrics, validated through extensive
human studies. Third, we propose an end-to-end model that processes streaming
video inputs to generate contextually appropriate responses, incorporating
novel techniques for handling data imbalance and long-duration videos. This

Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large
language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to
novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in
a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the
persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference
heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from
the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for
reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection
practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate
how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we
outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted
interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.

Abstract: Modeling urban crime is an important yet challenging task that requires
understanding the subtle visual, social, and cultural cues embedded in urban
environments. Previous work has predominantly focused on rule-based agent-based
modeling (ABM) and deep learning methods. ABMs offer interpretability of
internal mechanisms but exhibit limited predictive accuracy.In contrast, deep
learning methods are often effective in prediction but are less interpretable
and require extensive training data. Moreover, both lines of work lack the
cognitive flexibility to adapt to changing environments. Leveraging the
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose CrimeMind, a novel
LLM-driven ABM framework for simulating urban crime within a multi-modal urban
context.A key innovation of our design is the integration of the Routine
Activity Theory (RAT) into the agentic workflow of CrimeMind, enabling it to
process rich multi-modal urban features and reason about criminal
behavior.However, RAT requires LLM agents to infer subtle cues in evaluating
environmental safety as part of assessing guardianship, which can be
challenging for LLMs. To address this, we collect a small-scale human-annotated
dataset and align CrimeMind's perception with human judgment via a
training-free textual gradient method.Experiments across four major U.S. cities
demonstrate that CrimeMind outperforms both traditional ABMs and deep learning
baselines in crime hotspot prediction and spatial distribution accuracy,
achieving up to a 24% improvement over the strongest baseline.Furthermore, we
conduct counterfactual simulations of external incidents and policy
interventions and it successfully captures the expected changes in crime
patterns, demonstrating its ability to reflect counterfactual
scenarios.Overall, CrimeMind enables fine-grained modeling of individual
behaviors and facilitates evaluation of real-world interventions.

Abstract: Combinatorial problems are present in a wide range of industries. Constraint
Programming (CP) is a well-suited problem-solving paradigm, but its core
process, namely constraint modelling, is a bottleneck for wider adoption.
Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as modelling assistants, transforming combinatorial
problem descriptions to executable constraint models, similar to coding
assistants. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling
are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do
not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap
by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark dataset that includes a diverse set
of well-known combinatorial problem classes sourced from the CP community,
structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this
dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare
and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint
modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax: the
high-level MiniZinc language and Python-based CPMpy library, and the
lower-level Python interface of the OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. In order to enhance
the ability of LLMs to produce valid constraint models, we systematically
evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods adapted
from existing LLM-based code generation research. Our results underscore the
modelling convenience provided by Python-based frameworks, as well as the
effectiveness of documentation-rich system prompts, which, augmented with
repeated sampling and self-verification, achieve further improvements, reaching
up to 70\% accuracy on this new, highly challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Large-scale itinerary planning is a variant of the traveling salesman
problem, aiming to determine an optimal path that maximizes the collected
points of interest (POIs) scores while minimizing travel time and cost, subject
to travel duration constraints. This paper analyzes the decomposability of
large-scale itinerary planning, proving that strict decomposability is
difficult to satisfy, and introduces a weak decomposability definition based on
a necessary condition, deriving the corresponding graph structures that fulfill
this property. With decomposability guaranteed, we propose a novel
multi-objective cooperative coevolutionary algorithm for large-scale itinerary
planning, addressing the challenges of component imbalance and interactions.
Specifically, we design a dynamic decomposition strategy based on the
normalized fitness within each component, define optimization potential
considering component scale and contribution, and develop a computational
resource allocation strategy. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a
set of real-world datasets. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art
multi-objective itinerary planning algorithms demonstrate the superiority of
our approach, with performance advantages increasing as the problem scale
grows.

techniques on MaxSAT solving. Experimental results show that ILP preprocessing
techniques help WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024
in the unweighted track, solve 15 additional instances. Moreover, current
state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily use an ILP solver in their portfolios,

Method: PersonaAgent包含个性化记忆模块（情景和语义记忆）和动作模块，通过系统提示（persona）协调，并采用测试时用户偏好对齐策略优化提示。

Result: 实验表明，PersonaAgent在个性化动作空间和实时应用中表现优异，优于其他基准方法。

Conclusion: PersonaAgent展示了动态定制用户体验的可行性和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents have recently emerged as advanced
paradigms that exhibit impressive capabilities in a wide range of domains and
tasks. Despite their potential, current LLM agents often adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, lacking the flexibility to respond to users'
varying needs and preferences. This limitation motivates us to develop
PersonaAgent, the first personalized LLM agent framework designed to address
versatile personalization tasks. Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two
complementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic
and semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the
agent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona
(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:
it leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while
the outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the
framework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that
simulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring
real-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between
simulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
PersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only
personalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time
real-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential
of our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences.

Conclusion: RefPlan提升了离线学习策略的灵活性、泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial when online exploration is
costly or unsafe but often struggles with high epistemic uncertainty due to
limited data. Existing methods rely on fixed conservative policies, restricting
adaptivity and generalization. To address this, we propose Reflect-then-Plan
(RefPlan), a novel doubly Bayesian offline model-based (MB) planning approach.
RefPlan unifies uncertainty modeling and MB planning by recasting planning as
Bayesian posterior estimation. At deployment, it updates a belief over
environment dynamics using real-time observations, incorporating uncertainty
into MB planning via marginalization. Empirical results on standard benchmarks
show that RefPlan significantly improves the performance of conservative
offline RL policies. In particular, RefPlan maintains robust performance under
high epistemic uncertainty and limited data, while demonstrating resilience to
changing environment dynamics, improving the flexibility, generalizability, and
robustness of offline-learned policies.

Conclusion: 这一研究为个性化金融推荐和跨模态融合提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product
recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like
collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users'
latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework
integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A
pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature
vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and
social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph
information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings.
Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model
outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong
interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial
recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.

Result: 实验结果表明，引入物品序列信息能显著提升推荐效果。

Conclusion: 时间序列信息的结合能够增强推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings
for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from
neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While
item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied,
the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less
explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware)
embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance
than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel
information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware
Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning
(such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on
three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the
incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances
recommendations.

remains limited due to the complexity of the optimization search space and
system-level coordination. In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of disaggregated inference at scale, evaluating hundreds of thousands of design
points across diverse workloads and hardware configurations. We find that
disaggregation is most effective for prefill-heavy traffic patterns and larger
models. Our results highlight the critical role of dynamic rate matching and
elastic scaling in achieving Pareto-optimal performance. Our findings offer
actionable insights for efficient disaggregated deployments to navigate the
trade-off between system throughput and interactivity.

Key words: 自回归模型, 图像重建, ConvNADE, 低差异序列, 像素块

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过观察图像像素子集预测未观察部分的问题，提出了一种适用于实值和彩色图像的高效卷积神经自回归分布估计器（ConvNADE）模型，并探讨了随机和低差异像素块对图像重建质量的影响。

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 自回归模型通常用于学习图像数据的分布，但像素顺序对模型性能有显著影响。本文旨在通过观察小部分像素预测未观察部分，并优化像素选择以提升性能。

Method: 提出了一种改进的ConvNADE模型，适用于实值和彩色图像，并比较了随机像素块和低差异像素块对图像重建的效果。

Result: 实验表明，选择类似低差异序列的像素能降低测试损失，并生成更真实的图像重建结果。

Conclusion: 低差异像素采样策略在图像重建任务中优于随机采样，且改进的ConvNADE模型在性能和效率上表现更优。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are often employed to learn distributions of image data
by decomposing the $D$-dimensional density function into a product of
one-dimensional conditional distributions. Each conditional depends on
preceding variables (pixels, in the case of image data), making the order in
which variables are processed fundamental to the model performance. In this
paper, we study the problem of observing a small subset of image pixels
(referred to as a pixel patch) to predict the unobserved parts of the image. As
our prediction mechanism, we propose a generalized and computationally
efficient version of the convolutional neural autoregressive distribution
estimator (ConvNADE) model adapted for real-valued and color images. Moreover,
we investigate the quality of image reconstruction when observing both random
pixel patches and low-discrepancy pixel patches inspired by quasi-Monte Carlo
theory. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that choosing the pixels
akin to a low-discrepancy sequence reduces test loss and produces more
realistic reconstructed images.

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 组织学和质谱成像（MSI）的配准可以更精确地识别组织中的结构变化和化学相互作用，但由于两者图像形成过程和维度不同，配准仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用pix2pix模型从MSI图像生成组织学图像，以实现单模态配准。

Result: 初步结果显示合成的组织学图像质量较高，互信息（MI）和结构相似性指数（SSIM）分别提高了+0.924和+0.419，优于基线U-Net模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在组织学和MSI配准中表现良好，为多模态图像配准提供了新思路。

Abstract: Registration of histological and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) allows for
more precise identification of structural changes and chemical interactions in
tissue. With histology and MSI having entirely different image formation
processes and dimensionalities, registration of the two modalities remains an
ongoing challenge. This work proposes a solution that synthesises histological
images from MSI, using a pix2pix model, to effectively enable unimodal
registration. Preliminary results show promising synthetic histology images
with limited artifacts, achieving increases in mutual information (MI) and
structural similarity index measures (SSIM) of +0.924 and +0.419, respectively,
compared to a baseline U-Net model. Our source code is available on GitHub:

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 胎儿超声图像因其低对比度、高相似性和高噪声等问题，传统ResNet方法在分类任务中表现不佳，尤其是缺乏上下文信息的有效关联。

Method: 提出了FPDANet网络，包含位置注意力机制（DAN）模块和双边多尺度信息融合模块（FPAN），以增强特征表示和捕捉多尺度特征依赖。

Result: FPDANet在Top-1和Top-5指标上分别取得了91.05%和100%的分类准确率，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FPDANet通过结合位置注意力和多尺度信息融合，显著提升了胎儿超声图像的分类性能。

Abstract: ResNet has been widely used in image classification tasks due to its ability
to model the residual dependence of constant mappings for linear computation.
However, the ResNet method adopts a unidirectional transfer of features and
lacks an effective method to correlate contextual information, which is not
effective in classifying fetal ultrasound images in the classification task,
and fetal ultrasound images have problems such as low contrast, high
similarity, and high noise. Therefore, we propose a bilateral multi-scale
information fusion network-based FPDANet to address the above challenges.
Specifically, we design the positional attention mechanism (DAN) module, which
utilizes the similarity of features to establish the dependency of different
spatial positional features and enhance the feature representation. In
addition, we design a bilateral multi-scale (FPAN) information fusion module to
capture contextual and global feature dependencies at different feature scales,
thereby further improving the model representation. FPDANet classification
results obtained 91.05\% and 100\% in Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, respectively,
and the experimental results proved the effectiveness and robustness of
FPDANet.

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 目前缺乏对纵向肺部肿瘤分割的自动化解决方案，而这是评估化疗反应的重要步骤。

Method: LinGuinE利用放射科医生初始标记，通过刚性配准传播点，并使用点有效性分类器筛选有效点生成分割。

Result: 在两个测试数据集上，LinGuinE的Dice分数提高了20%以上（p<0.05），验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: LinGuinE在纵向肺部肿瘤分割中表现优异，且起始时间点灵活性高。

Abstract: Segmentation of lung gross tumour volumes is an important first step in
radiotherapy and surgical intervention, and is starting to play a role in
assessing chemotherapy response. Response to a drug is measured by tracking the
tumour volumes over a series of CT scans over a time period i.e. a longitudinal
study. However, there currently exist few solutions for automated or
semi-automated longitudinal tumour segmentation. This paper introduces
LinGuinE, an automated method to segment a longitudinal series of lung tumours.
A radiologist must provide an initial input, indicating the location of the
tumour in a CT scan at an arbitrary time point. LinGuinE samples points inside
this tumour and propagates them to another time point using rigid registration.
A click validity classifier selects points which still fall within the tumour;
these are used to automatically create a segmentation in the new time point. We
test LinGuinE on a dataset acquired from a phase 3 clinical trial for lung
tumours and the publicly available 4-D lung CBCT dataset. We find that LinGuinE
improves the Dice on both test sets by over 20% (p< 0.05) across 63
longitudinal studies. We show that any time point can be used as a starting
point, conduct ablation experiments, and find that our LinGuinE setup yields
the best results on both test datasets.

Motivation: TESS的主要目标是发现新系外行星，但其数据也适合研究短周期食变双星，这对恒星形成和演化研究具有重要意义。

Method: 使用神经网络分析TESS全帧图像数据，筛选出约120万个可能为食变双星的恒星，并对其中的6万个进行了自动化和人工验证。

Conclusion: TESS数据为食变双星研究提供了丰富资源，新发现的系统为恒星演化研究提供了宝贵样本。

Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has surveyed nearly the
entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).

Abstract: Recently, description logic LE-ALC was introduced for reasoning in the
semantic environment of enriched formal contexts, and a polynomial-time
tableaux algorithm was developed to check the consistency of knowledge bases
with acyclic TBoxes. In this work, we introduce a fuzzy generalization of
LE-ALC called LE-FALC which provides a description logic counterpart of
many-valued normal non-distributive logic a.k.a. many-valued LE-logic. This
description logic can be used to represent and reason about knowledge in the
formal framework of fuzzy formal contexts and fuzzy formal concepts. We provide
a tableaux algorithm that provides a complete and sound polynomial-time
decision procedure to check the consistency of LE-FALC ABoxes. As a result, we
also obtain an exponential-time decision procedure for checking the consistency
of LE-FALC with acyclic TBoxes by unraveling.

Conclusion: 区域性表示为神经网络的可解释性提供了新的路径，且在某些条件下可直接用于构建格或逻辑表示。

Abstract: A possible path to the interpretability of neural networks is to
(approximately) represent them in the regional format of piecewise linear
functions, where regions of inputs are associated to linear functions computing
the network outputs. We present an algorithm for the translation of feedforward
neural networks with ReLU activation functions in hidden layers and truncated
identity activation functions in the output layer. We also empirically
investigate the complexity of regional representations outputted by our method
for neural networks with varying sizes. Lattice and logical representations of
neural networks are straightforward from regional representations as long as
they satisfy a specific property. So we empirically investigate to what extent
the translations by our algorithm satisfy such property.

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 现有数据平面上的匹配-动作表（MAT）抽象与深度学习推理不匹配，导致准确性下降、规模受限和缺乏通用性。

Method: Pegasus将深度学习操作转换为三个数据平面原语：Partition、Map和SumReduce，并结合Primitive Fusion和全精度权重固定点激活技术。

Result: 在P4交换机上实现，支持多种DL模型（如MLP、RNN、CNN等），准确性平均提升22.8%，模型规模最大提升248倍，输入规模提升212倍。

Conclusion: Pegasus显著提升了数据平面上深度学习模型的性能和通用性，为智能数据平面提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The paradigm of Intelligent DataPlane (IDP) embeds deep learning (DL) models
on the network dataplane to enable intelligent traffic analysis at line-speed.
However, the current use of the match-action table (MAT) abstraction on the
dataplane is misaligned with DL inference, leading to several key limitations,
including accuracy degradation, limited scale, and lack of generality. This
paper proposes Pegasus to address these limitations. Pegasus translates DL
operations into three dataplane-oriented primitives to achieve generality:
Partition, Map, and SumReduce. Specifically, Partition "divides"
high-dimensional features into multiple low-dimensional vectors, making them
more suitable for the dataplane; Map "conquers" computations on the
low-dimensional vectors in parallel with the technique of fuzzy matching, while
SumReduce "combines" the computation results. Additionally, Pegasus employs
Primitive Fusion to merge computations, improving scalability. Finally, Pegasus
adopts full precision weights with fixed-point activations to improve accuracy.
Our implementation on a P4 switch demonstrates that Pegasus can effectively
support various types of DL models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and
AutoEncoder models on the dataplane. Meanwhile, Pegasus outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches with an average accuracy improvement of up to
22.8%, along with up to 248x larger model size and 212x larger input scale.

Conclusion: MPS作为一种通用框架，适用于各种数据生成过程、结构和模型类别，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for
online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection
methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the
stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo
gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary,
and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To
tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence
sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the
evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a
confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time
period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity
of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we
demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under
nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover,
MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose
evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic
framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model
class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable
across diverse problem settings.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在计算效率、模型错误稳健性方面优于现有的非线性DAG学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性加性噪声模型下的因果推断提供了一种高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of
various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make
restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or
require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we
propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed
partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging
the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions.
We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a
restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based
algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated
CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their
adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To
determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the
log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a
sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in
the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of
our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient,
robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing
nonlinear DAG learning methods.

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.

Method: 提出了一种仅使用文本的微调策略，通过实时评估机制保持语音-文本对齐，从而在不需额外音频的情况下实现领域适应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LibriSpeech、SlideSpeech和Medical数据集上取得了与全音频-文本微调相媲美的识别性能，且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 文本仅微调策略为低资源ASR领域适应提供了有效解决方案，避免了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have combined speech
encoders with large language models (LLMs) through projection, forming Speech
LLMs with strong performance. However, adapting them to new domains remains
challenging, especially in low-resource settings where paired speech-text data
is scarce. We propose a text-only fine-tuning strategy for Speech LLMs using
unpaired target-domain text without requiring additional audio. To preserve
speech-text alignment, we introduce a real-time evaluation mechanism during
fine-tuning. This enables effective domain adaptation while maintaining
source-domain performance. Experiments on LibriSpeech, SlideSpeech, and Medical
datasets show that our method achieves competitive recognition performance,
with minimal degradation compared to full audio-text fine-tuning. It also
improves generalization to new domains without catastrophic forgetting,
highlighting the potential of text-only fine-tuning for low-resource domain
adaptation of ASR.

Abstract: Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) can understand the textual and
non-textual information in the audio input. In this paper, we explore using
ALLMs as an automatic judge to assess the speaking styles of speeches. We use
ALLM judges to evaluate the speeches generated by SLMs on two tasks: voice
style instruction following and role-playing. The speaking style we consider
includes emotion, volume, speaking pace, word emphasis, pitch control, and
non-verbal elements. We use four spoken language models (SLMs) to complete the
two tasks and use humans and ALLMs to judge the SLMs' responses. We compare two
ALLM judges, GPT-4o-audio and Gemini-2.5-pro, with human evaluation results and
show that the agreement between Gemini and human judges is comparable to the
agreement between human evaluators. These promising results show that ALLMs can
be used as a judge to evaluate SLMs. Our results also reveal that current SLMs,
even GPT-4o-audio, still have room for improvement in controlling the speaking
style and generating natural dialogues.

*Yun-Shao Tsai,Yi-Cheng Lin,Huang-Cheng Chou,Hung-yi Lee*

Key words: 语音情感识别,偏见,公平性,语音转换,数据增强

TL;DR: CO-VADA是一种无需依赖人口统计信息或修改模型架构的语音情感识别（SER）去偏方法，通过语音转换生成多样化的训练样本以减少偏见。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.AS

Motivation: 语音情感识别系统中因说话者特征与情感标签的虚假关联导致的偏见问题，限制了系统的公平性。现有方法通常需要人口统计信息或模型修改，实用性有限。

Method: CO-VADA通过识别反映训练数据偏见的样本，应用语音转换技术改变无关特征，生成多样化样本，从而引导模型关注情感相关特征。

Result: 该方法兼容多种SER模型和语音转换工具，可扩展且实用，有效提高了SER系统的公平性。

Conclusion: CO-VADA为SER系统提供了一种无需人口统计信息或架构修改的去偏解决方案，具有良好的实用性和公平性提升效果。

Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious
correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to
unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods
require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their
practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation
Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or
relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that
reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice
conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented
samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the
data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our
framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools,
making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER
systems.

Motivation: 由于系统故障的罕见性和复杂性，确保具身AI系统在复杂操作环境中的安全性是一个重大挑战，尤其是在安全关键领域的大规模部署。传统确定性安全验证方法在实际中难以实现。

Method: 提出可证明概率安全范式，通过统计方法建立系统整体性能的概率安全边界，替代对所有极端情况的穷举验证。

Result: 该方法能够在保证系统安全的同时，支持大规模部署和安全性持续改进。

Conclusion: 本工作为具身AI系统在安全关键领域的大规模安全部署提供了理论和实践结合的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are
increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system
failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a
major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in
safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and
robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system
safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity
and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable
embodied AI systems. To address this challenge, we introduce provable
probabilistic safety, which aims to ensure that the residual risk of
large-scale deployment remains below a predefined threshold. Instead of
attempting exhaustive safety proof across all corner cases, this paradigm
establishes a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance,
leveraging statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability. A
well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be
deployed at scale while allowing for continuous refinement of safety
guarantees. Our work focuses on three core questions: what is provable
probabilistic safety, how to prove the probabilistic safety, and how to achieve
the provable probabilistic safety. By bridging the gap between theoretical
safety assurance and practical deployment, our work offers a pathway toward
safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical
applications.

Main category: eess.SY

Motivation: 随着淡水需求增加，污水处理厂的优化运营变得至关重要。然而，大量监测数据难以被管理者直接理解和利用。

Method: 采用XAI和机器学习（ML）方法，对污水处理厂的历史数据进行分析，提取低维空间中的运营模式，并解释相关变量和设施单元。

Result: 成功将大量历史数据总结为少数可解释的运营模式，明确了各模式涉及的变量和设施。

Conclusion: XAI和ML方法能够有效支持污水处理厂的数据管理和运营模式分析，提供可解释的知识。

Abstract: Water reuse is a key point when fresh water is a commodity in ever greater
demand, but which is also becoming ever more available. Furthermore, the return
of clean water to its natural environment is also mandatory. Therefore,
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential in any policy focused on
these serious challenges.
  WWTPs are complex facilities which need to operate at their best to achieve
their goals. Nowadays, they are largely monitored, generating large databases
of historical data concerning their functioning over time. All this implies a
large amount of embedded information which is not usually easy for plant
managers to assimilate, correlate and understand; in other words, for them to
know the global operation of the plant at any given time. At this point, the
intelligent and Machine Learning (ML) approaches can give support for that
need, managing all the data and translating them into manageable, interpretable
and explainable knowledge about how the WWTP plant is operating at a glance.
  Here, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) based methodology is
proposed and tested for a real WWTP, in order to extract explainable service
knowledge concerning the operation modes of the WWTP managed by AQUAVALL, which
is the public service in charge of the integral water cycle in the City Council
of Valladolid (Castilla y Le\'on, Spain). By applying well-known approaches of
XAI and ML focused on the challenge of WWTP, it has been possible to summarize
a large number of historical databases through a few explained operation modes
of the plant in a low-dimensional data space, showing the variables and
facility units involved in each case.

Result: USM克服了现有模型的低效性和刚性，为可扩展、通用的AI系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: USM通过动态计算图实现了模块化、可解释和资源高效的计算，为未来AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for analyzing deep
learning systems by leveraging Infinite Time Turing Machines (ITTMs), which
extend classical computation into transfinite ordinal steps. Using ITTMs, we
reinterpret modern architectures like Transformers, revealing fundamental
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and interpretability. Building on these
insights, we propose the Universal State Machine (USM), a novel computational
paradigm designed from first principles. The USM employs a dynamic, queryable
computation graph that evolves in real time, enabling modular, interpretable,

inefficiencies and rigidity of current models but also lays the groundwork for
scalable, generalizable artificial intelligence systems.

Result: 在CALLHOME数据集上，实验表明改进方法提高了说话人日志的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多阶段说话人属性建模和Conformer的应用，说话人日志性能得到显著提升。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end approaches have made notable progress in
addressing the challenge of speaker diarization, which involves segmenting and
identifying speakers in multi-talker recordings. One such approach,
Encoder-Decoder Attractors (EDA), has been proposed to handle variable speaker
counts as well as better guide the network during training. In this study, we
extend the attractor paradigm by moving beyond direct speaker modeling and
instead focus on representing more detailed `speaker attributes' through a
multi-stage process of intermediate representations. Additionally, we enhance
the architecture by replacing transformers with conformers, a
convolution-augmented transformer, to model local dependencies. Experiments
demonstrate improved diarization performance on the CALLHOME dataset.

Motivation: 语音中的副语言/非语言信息对听众印象有重要影响，但目前零样本TTS在控制语音印象方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用低维向量表示语音印象强度，结合大语言模型生成目标印象描述。

Result: 通过主客观评估验证了该方法在控制语音印象方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动优化，实现了通过自然语言描述生成目标印象的功能。

Abstract: Para-/non-linguistic information in speech is pivotal in shaping the
listeners' impression. Although zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) has achieved
high speaker fidelity, modulating subtle para-/non-linguistic information to
control perceived voice characteristics, i.e., impressions, remains
challenging. We have therefore developed a voice impression control method in
zero-shot TTS that utilizes a low-dimensional vector to represent the
intensities of various voice impression pairs (e.g., dark-bright). The results
of both objective and subjective evaluations have demonstrated our method's
effectiveness in impression control. Furthermore, generating this vector via a
large language model enables target-impression generation from a natural
language description of the desired impression, thus eliminating the need for
manual optimization.

Motivation: 探索CTC中隐含的上下文依赖性，并提出改进方法以提高性能。

Method: 提出基于知识蒸馏（KD）的上下文相关ILM估计方法，并引入两种正则化方法。

Result: 实验表明，上下文相关的ILM优于上下文无关的先验模型，KD平滑方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: CTC能够学习上下文相关的ILM，提出的KD方法在跨域评估中表现优异。

Abstract: Although connectionist temporal classification (CTC) has the label context
independence assumption, it can still implicitly learn a context-dependent
internal language model (ILM) due to modern powerful encoders. In this work, we
investigate the implicit context dependency modeled in the ILM of CTC. To this
end, we propose novel context-dependent ILM estimation methods for CTC based on
knowledge distillation (KD) with theoretical justifications. Furthermore, we
introduce two regularization methods for KD. We conduct experiments on
Librispeech and TED-LIUM Release 2 datasets for in-domain and cross-domain
evaluation, respectively. Experimental results show that context-dependent ILMs
outperform the context-independent priors in cross-domain evaluation,
indicating that CTC learns a context-dependent ILM. The proposed label-level KD
with smoothing method surpasses other ILM estimation approaches, with more than
13% relative improvement in word error rate compared to shallow fusion.

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 评估文本到音乐系统的Mean Opinion Score (MOS)需要同时考虑音乐质量和文本对齐。WhisQ旨在通过多模态架构解决这一双重评估挑战。

Method: WhisQ结合Whisper Base音频编码和Qwen 3文本编码，采用序列级共注意力和最优传输正则化，通过OMQ和TA两条预测路径实现评价。

Result: 在MusicEval Track-1数据集上，WhisQ显著优于基线方法：OMQ的Spearman相关系数提升7%，TA提升14%，最优传输正则化的贡献最大（10% SRCC改进）。

Conclusion: WhisQ展示了多模态架构在文本到音乐评价中的有效性，最优传输正则化对跨模态对齐具有关键作用。

Abstract: Mean Opinion Score (MOS) prediction for text to music systems requires
evaluating both overall musical quality and text prompt alignment. This paper
introduces WhisQ, a multimodal architecture that addresses this dual-assessment
challenge through sequence level co-attention and optimal transport
regularization. WhisQ employs the Whisper Base pretrained model for temporal
audio encoding and Qwen 3, a 0.6B Small Language Model (SLM), for text
encoding, with both maintaining sequence structure for fine grained cross-modal
modeling. The architecture features specialized prediction pathways: OMQ is
predicted from pooled audio embeddings, while TA leverages bidirectional
sequence co-attention between audio and text. Sinkhorn optimal transport loss
further enforce semantic alignment in the shared embedding space. On the
MusicEval Track-1 dataset, WhisQ achieves substantial improvements over the
baseline: 7% improvement in Spearman correlation for OMQ and 14% for TA.
Ablation studies reveal that optimal transport regularization provides the
largest performance gain (10% SRCC improvement), demonstrating the importance
of explicit cross-modal alignment for text-to-music evaluation.

Motivation: 确保机器学习模型不会对特定群体产生系统性偏见，尤其是基于种族、性别或年龄等保护属性的群体。

Method: 使用{fairmetrics} R包，提供了基于独立性、分离性和充分性的公平性指标评估。

Result: 该包提供了方便的封装函数和示例数据集，支持多种公平性指标的点和区间估计。

Conclusion: {fairmetrics} R包为评估群体公平性提供了一个用户友好的工具，有助于实施偏见缓解策略。

Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring
models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups,
particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or
age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as
biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R
package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous
group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g.,
statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g.,
predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is
equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that
appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics}
provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a
convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).

Motivation: 现有IaC模板生成研究仅关注语法正确性，忽略了可部署性这一关键指标，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过IaCGen框架（利用迭代反馈机制生成IaC模板）和DPIaC-Eval基准（评估语法、部署、用户意图和安全性）进行研究。

Result: 初始LLM表现较差（Claude-3.5和Claude-3.7部署成功率分别为30.2%和26.8%），但IaCGen显著提升至超过90%，用户意图和安全性仍是挑战。

Conclusion: 论文首次全面评估了可部署性为中心的IaC模板生成，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) generation holds significant promise for
automating cloud infrastructure provisioning. Recent advances in Large Language
Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity to democratize IaC development by
generating deployable infrastructure templates from natural language
descriptions, but current evaluation focuses on syntactic correctness while
ignoring deployability, the fatal measure of IaC template utility. We address
this gap through two contributions: (1) IaCGen, an LLM-based
deployability-centric framework that uses iterative feedback mechanism to
generate IaC templates, and (2) DPIaC-Eval, a deployability-centric IaC
template benchmark consists of 153 real-world scenarios that can evaluate
syntax, deployment, user intent, and security. Our evaluation reveals that
state-of-the-art LLMs initially performed poorly, with Claude-3.5 and
Claude-3.7 achieving only 30.2% and 26.8% deployment success on the first
attempt respectively. However, IaCGen transforms this performance dramatically:
all evaluated models reach over 90% passItr@25, with Claude-3.5 and Claude-3.7
achieving 98% success rate. Despite these improvements, critical challenges
remain in user intent alignment (25.2% accuracy) and security compliance (8.4%
pass rate), highlighting areas requiring continued research. Our work provides
the first comprehensive assessment of deployability-centric IaC template
generation and establishes a foundation for future research.

Abstract: Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise
correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a
large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions,
is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain.
Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale
datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of
the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that
creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply
this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved
test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in
CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels
to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results
indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than
CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR).
Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further
confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages
for RL.

Abstract: Competitive programming contests play a crucial role in cultivating
computational thinking and algorithmic skills among learners. However,
generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions
remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces
an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language
models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive
programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse
datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for
5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the
International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate
that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably
identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade
programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary
educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly
sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical
NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to
enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner
performance.

Conclusion: DesignBench为MLLMs在前端工程中的能力提供了全面评估，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in automated front-end engineering, e.g., generating UI code from
visual designs. However, existing front-end UI code generation benchmarks have
the following limitations: (1) While framework-based development becomes
predominant in modern front-end programming, current benchmarks fail to
incorporate mainstream development frameworks. (2) Existing evaluations focus
solely on the UI code generation task, whereas practical UI development
involves several iterations, including refining editing, and repairing issues.
(3) Current benchmarks employ unidimensional evaluation, lacking investigation
into influencing factors like task difficulty, input context variations, and
in-depth code-level analysis. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DesignBench, a
multi-framework, multi-task evaluation benchmark for assessing MLLMs'
capabilities in automated front-end engineering. DesignBench encompasses three
widely-used UI frameworks (React, Vue, and Angular) alongside vanilla HTML/CSS,
and evaluates on three essential front-end tasks (generation, edit, and repair)
in real-world development workflows. DesignBench contains 900 webpage samples
spanning over 11 topics, 9 edit types, and 6 issue categories, enabling
detailed analysis of MLLM performance across multiple dimensions. Our
systematic evaluation reveals critical insights into MLLMs' framework-specific
limitations, task-related bottlenecks, and performance variations under
different conditions, providing guidance for future research in automated
front-end development. Our code and data are available at

Abstract: Signal restoration and inverse problems are key elements in most real-world
data science applications. In the past decades, with the emergence of machine
learning methods, inversion of measurements has become a popular step in almost
all physical applications, which is normally executed prior to downstream tasks
that often involve parameter estimation. In this work, we analyze the general
problem of parameter estimation in an inverse problem setting. First, we
address the domain-shift problem by re-formulating it in direct relation with
the discrete parameter estimation analysis. We analyze a significant
vulnerability in current attempts to enforce domain generalization, which we
dubbed the Double Meaning Theorem. Our theoretical findings are experimentally
illustrated for domain shift examples in image deblurring and speckle
suppression in medical imaging. We then proceed to a theoretical analysis of
parameter estimation given observed measurements before and after data
processing involving an inversion of the observations. We compare this setting
for invertible and non-invertible (degradation) processes. We distinguish
between continuous and discrete parameter estimation, corresponding with
regression and classification problems, respectively. Our theoretical findings
align with the well-known information-theoretic data processing inequality, and
to a certain degree question the common misconception that data-processing for
inversion, based on modern generative models that may often produce outstanding
perceptual quality, will necessarily improve the following parameter estimation
objective. It is our hope that this paper will provide practitioners with
deeper insights that may be leveraged in the future for the development of more
efficient and informed strategic system planning, critical in safety-sensitive
applications.

Result: 算法在在线环境中实现次线性遗憾，实验中安全策略表现优于理论界限。

Conclusion: 安全投标策略在实践中表现优异，特别适合需要满足RoI约束的多单元拍卖场景。

Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions
from the perspective of a single value-maximizing buyer who aims to maximize
their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to return-on-investment
(RoI) constraints in each round. Buyers adopt $m$-uniform bidding format, where
they submit $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid
$b_i$. We introduce safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy RoI
constraints in every auction, regardless of competing bids. We show that these
strategies depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can
focus on a finite subset of this class without loss of generality. While the
number of strategies in this subset is exponential in $m$, we develop a
polynomial-time algorithm to learn the optimal safe strategy that achieves
sublinear regret in the online setting, where regret is measured against a
clairvoyant benchmark that knows the competing bids a priori and selects a
fixed hindsight optimal safe strategy. We then evaluate the performance of safe
strategies against a clairvoyant that selects the optimal strategy from a
richer class of strategies in the online setting. In this scenario, we compute
the richness ratio, $\alpha\in(0, 1]$ for the class of strategies chosen by the
clairvoyant and show that our algorithm, designed to learn safe strategies,
achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger
benchmarks. Experiments on semi-synthetic data from real-world auctions show
that safe strategies substantially outperform the derived theoretical bounds,
making them quite appealing in practice.

Conclusion: 分裂预言机为层次聚类问题提供了新的解决方案，克服了传统方法的近似障碍，并为子线性场景提出了高效算法。

Abstract: Hierarchical clustering (HC) is an important data analysis technique in which
the goal is to recursively partition a dataset into a tree-like structure while
grouping together similar data points at each level of granularity.
Unfortunately, for many of the proposed HC objectives, there exist strong
barriers to approximation algorithms with the hardness of approximation. Thus,
we consider the problem of hierarchical clustering given auxiliary information
from natural oracles. Specifically, we focus on a *splitting oracle* which,
when provided with a triplet of vertices $(u,v,w)$, answers (possibly
erroneously) the pairs of vertices whose lowest common ancestor includes all
three vertices in an optimal tree, i.e., identifying which vertex ``splits
away'' from the others. Using such an oracle, we obtain the following results:
  - A polynomial-time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $O(1)$-approximation to the Dasgupta objective (Dasgupta [STOC'16]).
  - A near-linear time algorithm that outputs a hierarchical clustering tree
with $(1-o(1))$-approximation to the Moseley-Wang objective (Moseley and Wang
[NeurIPS'17]).
  Under the plausible Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, no polynomial-time
algorithm can achieve any constant approximation for Dasgupta's objective or
$(1-C)$-approximation for the Moseley-Wang objective for some constant $C>0$.
As such, our results demonstrate that the splitting oracle enables algorithms
to outperform standard HC approaches and overcome hardness constraints.
Furthermore, our approaches extend to sublinear settings, in which we show new
streaming and PRAM algorithms for HC with improved guarantees.

<details>

Main category: math.OC

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络在多参数二次优化问题（mp-QP）中无法提供最优且可行的预测，即使在大数据集上训练。需要一种能直接利用数学结构的新方法。

Method: 设计部分监督神经网络（PSNN），直接从优化问题的数学性质推导大部分模型权重，减少对训练数据的依赖。

Result: PSNN在解准确性和预测速度上优于传统深度神经网络和商用求解器，即使在小数据集或极端测试数据下仍表现优异。

Conclusion: PSNN为多参数二次优化问题提供了一种快速、准确的解决方案，尤其适用于能源管理等工程应用。

Abstract: Neural Networks (NN) with ReLU activation functions are used to model
multiparametric quadratic optimization problems (mp-QP) in diverse engineering
applications. Researchers have suggested leveraging the piecewise affine
property of deep NN models to solve mp-QP with linear constraints, which also
exhibit piecewise affine behaviour. However, traditional deep NN applications
to mp-QP fall short of providing optimal and feasible predictions, even when
trained on large datasets. This study proposes a partially-supervised NN (PSNN)
architecture that directly represents the mathematical structure of the global
solution function. In contrast to generic NN training approaches, the proposed
PSNN method derives a large proportion of model weights directly from the
mathematical properties of the optimization problem, producing more accurate
solutions despite significantly smaller training data sets. Many energy
management problems are formulated as QP, so we apply the proposed approach to
energy systems (specifically DC optimal power flow) to demonstrate proof of
concept. Model performance in terms of solution accuracy and speed of
predictions was compared against a commercial solver and a generic Deep NN
model based on classical training. Results show KKT sufficient conditions for
PSNN consistently outperform generic NN architectures with classical training
using far less data, including when tested on extreme, out-of-training
distribution test data. Given its speed advantages over traditional solvers,
the PSNN model can quickly produce optimal and feasible solutions within a
second for millions of input parameters sampled from a distribution of
stochastic demands and renewable generator dispatches, which can be used for
simulations and long term planning.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning, despite its popularity and empirical
success, faces significant scalability challenges in large-population dynamic
games. Graphon mean field games (GMFGs) offer a principled framework for
approximating such games while capturing heterogeneity among players. In this
paper, we propose and analyze a policy optimization framework for
continuous-time, finite-horizon linear-quadratic GMFGs. Exploiting the
structural properties of GMFGs, we design an efficient policy parameterization
in which each player's policy is represented as an affine function of their
private state, with a shared slope function and player-specific intercepts. We
develop a bilevel optimization algorithm that alternates between policy
gradient updates for best-response computation under a fixed population
distribution, and distribution updates using the resulting policies. We prove
linear convergence of the policy gradient steps to best-response policies and
establish global convergence of the overall algorithm to the Nash equilibrium.
The analysis relies on novel landscape characterizations over
infinite-dimensional policy spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate the
convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm under varying graphon
structures, noise levels, and action frequencies.

Motivation: 动机是通过线性规划层次结构高效计算自旋系统中局部函数的期望值，避免传统蒙特卡洛方法对收敛速度的先验分析需求。

Method: 方法包括两种层次结构：一是基于局部自旋翻转等式的层次结构，适用于高能物理中的bootstrap文献；二是基于马尔可夫链的层次结构，适用于优化和bootstrap文献。

Result: 结果表明，在空间混合条件（如伊辛模型临界温度以上）或马尔可夫链快速混合条件下，两种层次结构均可实现快速收敛，且能提供严格的上下界。

Conclusion: 结论是这两种层次结构在满足一定条件时，能够高效地近似局部期望值，且具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions
under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two
families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first
hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the
bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast
convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This
condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising
models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov
chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the
optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this
hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly.
Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation
values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$,
where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be
embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard
Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for
any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of
interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.

<details>

Main category: stat.ME

Motivation: 传统ARMA-ARCH模型依赖于假设特定依赖类型，可能导致偏差。因此，需要一种更灵活的方法来适应非平稳时间序列的动态特性。

Method: 采用移动估计器，通过指数加权旧值优化局部对数似然，并使用EMA（指数移动平均）更新参数（如绝对中心矩）。重点应用alpha-Stable分布，并估计其参数的动态演化。

Result: 该方法成功应用于DJIA金融时间序列，动态估计中心、尺度参数和尾部行为参数α，用于评估市场稳定性和极端事件概率。

Conclusion: 移动估计器为自适应建模非平稳时间序列提供了有效工具，尤其在金融数据分析中表现出色。

Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In
classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen
dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic
approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every
time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau<t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta
(x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old
values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential
moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central
moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We
will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also
influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its
application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside
standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$,
there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to
continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim
1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous
extreme events.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for
their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based
systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design
requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the
engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can
achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the
deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some
deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or
raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding
those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering
Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant
organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.

Abstract: Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.

Conclusion: Gen4D和SportPAL为合成数据集的构建提供了可扩展的解决方案，无需手动3D建模或场景设计。

Abstract: Lack of input data for in-the-wild activities often results in low
performance across various computer vision tasks. This challenge is
particularly pronounced in uncommon human-centric domains like sports, where
real-world data collection is complex and impractical. While synthetic datasets
offer a promising alternative, existing approaches typically suffer from
limited diversity in human appearance, motion, and scene composition due to
their reliance on rigid asset libraries and hand-crafted rendering pipelines.
To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating
diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations. Gen4D integrates expert-driven
motion encoding, prompt-guided avatar generation using diffusion-based Gaussian
splatting, and human-aware background synthesis to produce highly varied and
lifelike human sequences. Based on Gen4D, we present SportPAL, a large-scale
synthetic dataset spanning three sports: baseball, icehockey, and soccer.
Together, Gen4D and SportPAL provide a scalable foundation for constructing
synthetic datasets tailored to in-the-wild human-centric vision tasks, with no
need for manual 3D modeling or scene design.

the reliance on manual processes. This study performs a systematic review of
existing generative AI techniques for 3D scene generation, analyzing their

how AI can blend different stylistic domains while maintaining coherence, the
impact of training data on output quality, and the limitations of current

Result: 在D-NeRF和NVFI基准测试中，PSNR提升高达10 dB，LPIPS误差减半，表现出色。

Conclusion: 连续时间潜在动态是实现复杂3D场景逼真预测的有效途径。

Abstract: We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with
latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D
scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering
systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation
network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict
the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS
eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned
deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer
encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose
continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this
latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can
be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a
variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS
attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving
PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the
strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent
dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of
complex 3D scenes.

Result: DART-Vetter在TESS和Kepler数据上表现出色，召回率达到91%，性能可与Exominer和Astronet-Triage媲美。其结构简洁、开源且易于复制，适合自动化筛选或辅助人工检查。

Conclusion: DART-Vetter是一种高效的深度学习工具，特别适用于MES>20且轨道周期<50天的TCEs，展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights,
have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power
consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems.
However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations
of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel
paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum
computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to
generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum
phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of
a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this
approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO),
when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in
simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as
commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE),
improving trainability and generalization.

Abstract: Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.

Abstract: The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.

Result: 实验表明新机制在预算限制下能提升数据质量，且对误报和合谋具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为LLM数据市场提供了可持续且公平的解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) requires vast amounts of high-quality
data from institutions that face legal, privacy, and strategic constraints.
Existing data procurement methods often rely on unverifiable trust or ignore
heterogeneous provider costs. We introduce a mechanism-design framework for
truthful, trust-minimized data sharing that ensures dominant-strategy incentive
compatibility (DSIC), individual rationality, and weak budget balance, while
rewarding data based on both quality and learning utility. We formalize a model
where providers privately know their data cost and quality, and value arises
solely from the data's contribution to model performance. Based on this, we
propose the Quality-Weighted Marginal-Incentive Auction (Q-MIA), which ranks
providers using a virtual cost metric and uses Myerson-style payments to ensure
DSIC and budget feasibility. To support settings with limited liquidity or
long-term incentives, we introduce the Marginal Utility Token (MUT), which
allocates future rights based on marginal contributions. We unify these in
Mixed-MIA, a hybrid mechanism balancing upfront payments and deferred rewards.
All mechanisms support verifiable, privacy-preserving implementation.
Theoretically and empirically, they outperform volume-based and trust-based
baselines, eliciting higher-quality data under budget constraints while
remaining robust to misreporting and collusion. This establishes a principled
foundation for sustainable and fair data markets for future LLMs.

Abstract: Bayesian persuasion, an extension of cheap-talk communication, involves an
informed sender committing to a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's
actions. Compared to cheap talk, this sender's commitment enables the receiver
to verify the incentive compatibility of signals beforehand, facilitating
cooperation. While effective in one-shot scenarios, Bayesian persuasion faces
computational complexity (NP-hardness) when extended to long-term interactions,
where the receiver may adopt dynamic strategies conditional on past outcomes
and future expectations. To address this complexity, we introduce the
bargaining perspective, which allows: (1) a unified framework and
well-structured solution concept for long-term persuasion, with desirable
properties such as fairness and Pareto efficiency; (2) a clear distinction
between two previously conflated advantages: the sender's informational
advantage and first-proposer advantage. With only modest modifications to the
standard setting, this perspective makes explicit the common knowledge of the
game structure and grants the receiver comparable commitment capabilities,
thereby reinterpreting classic one-sided persuasion as a balanced information
bargaining framework. The framework is validated through a two-stage
validation-and-inference paradigm: We first demonstrate that GPT-o3 and
DeepSeek-R1, out of publicly available LLMs, reliably handle standard tasks; We
then apply them to persuasion scenarios to test that the outcomes align with
what our information-bargaining framework suggests. All code, results, and
terminal logs are publicly available at

Abstract: With the integration of renewable sources in electricity distribution
networks, the need to develop intelligent mechanisms for balancing the energy
market has arisen. In the absence of such mechanisms, the energy market may
face imbalances that can lead to power outages, financial losses or instability
at the grid level. In this context, the grouping of microgrids into optimal
coalitions that can absorb energy from the market during periods of surplus or
supply energy to the market during periods of is a key aspect in the efficient
management of distribution networks. In this article, we propose a method that
identify an optimal microgrids coalition capable of addressing the dynamics of
the energy market. The proposed method models the problem of identifying the
optimal coalition as an optimization problem that it solves by combining a
strategy inspired by cooperative game theory with a memetic algorithm. An
individual is represented as a coalition of microgrids and the evolution of
population of individuals over generations is assured by recombination and
mutation. The fitness function is defined as the difference between the total
value generated by the coalition and a penalty applied to the coalition when
the energy traded by coalition exceeds the energy available/demanded on/by the
energy market. The value generated by the coalition is calculated based on the
profit obtained by the collation if it sells energy on the market during
periods of deficit or the savings obtained by the coalition if it buys energy
on the market during periods of surplus and the costs associated with the
trading process. This value is divided equitably among the coalition members,
according to the Shapley value, which considers the contribution of each one to
the formation of collective value.

Motivation: 异构图神经网络（HGNNs）在异构图中表现优异，但在跨领域和任务中泛化能力有限。现有方法通过结合HGNNs和大语言模型（LLMs），但HG tokens的嵌入空间差异和任务局限性影响了模型性能。

Conclusion: MLM4HG通过文本化异构结构和统一任务范式，显著提升了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), while struggling to
generalize across domains and tasks. Recently, some researchers have turned to
integrating HGNNs with large language models (LLMs) for more generalizable
heterogeneous graph learning. However, these approaches typically extract
structural information via HGNNs as HG tokens, and disparities in embedding
spaces between HGNNs and LLMs have been shown to bias the LLM's comprehension
of HGs. Moreover, as these HG tokens are often derived from node-level tasks,
the model's ability to generalize across tasks remains limited. To this end, we
propose a simple yet effective Masked Language Modeling-based method, called
MLM4HG. MLM4HG introduces metapath-based textual sequences instead of HG tokens
to extract structural and semantic information inherent in HGs, and designs
customized textual templates to unify different graph tasks into a coherent
cloze-style "mask" token prediction paradigm. Specifically, MLM4HG first
converts HGs from various domains to texts based on metapaths, and subsequently
combines them with the unified task texts to form a HG-based corpus. Moreover,
the corpus is fed into a pretrained LM for fine-tuning with a constrained
target vocabulary, enabling the fine-tuned LM to generalize to unseen target
HGs. Extensive cross-domain and multi-task experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization performance of MLM4HG over
state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/MLM4HG.

Result: 论文提供了对音频-视频DeepFake检测关键问题的深入见解，并提出了一套完整的解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂的音频-视频DeepFake检测领域提供了前进方向。

Abstract: Generative AI advances rapidly, allowing the creation of very realistic
manipulated video and audio. This progress presents a significant security and
ethical threat, as malicious users can exploit DeepFake techniques to spread
misinformation. Recent DeepFake detection approaches explore the multimodal
(audio-video) threat scenario. In particular, there is a lack of
reproducibility and critical issues with existing datasets - such as the
recently uncovered silence shortcut in the widely used FakeAVCeleb dataset.
Considering the importance of this topic, we aim to gain a deeper understanding
of the key issues affecting benchmarking in audio-video DeepFake detection. We
examine these challenges through the lens of the three core benchmarking
pillars: datasets, detection methods, and evaluation protocols. To address
these issues, we spotlight the recent DeepSpeak v1 dataset and are the first to
propose an evaluation protocol and benchmark it using SOTA models. We introduce
SImple Multimodal BAseline (SIMBA), a competitive yet minimalistic approach
that enables the exploration of diverse design choices. We also deepen insights
into the issue of audio shortcuts and present a promising mitigation strategy.
Finally, we analyze and enhance the evaluation scheme on the widely used
FakeAVCeleb dataset. Our findings offer a way forward in the complex area of
audio-video DeepFake detection.

Conclusion: PnP绕过模型再训练，适应任意图像，对当前水印技术的安全性提出更大挑战，威胁合成数据的生成与治理权威。

Abstract: Watermarking becomes one of the pivotal solutions to trace and verify the
origin of synthetic images generated by artificial intelligence models, but it
is not free of risks. Recent studies demonstrate the capability to forge
watermarks from a target image onto cover images via adversarial optimization
without knowledge of the target generative model and watermark schemes. In this
paper, we uncover a greater risk of an optimization-free and universal
watermark forgery that harnesses existing regenerative diffusion models. Our
proposed forgery attack, PnP (Plug-and-Plant), seamlessly extracts and
integrates the target watermark via regenerating the image, without needing any
additional optimization routine. It allows for universal watermark forgery that
works independently of the target image's origin or the watermarking model
used. We explore the watermarked latent extracted from the target image and
visual-textual context of cover images as priors to guide sampling of the
regenerative process. Extensive evaluation on 24 scenarios of
model-data-watermark combinations demonstrates that PnP can successfully forge
the watermark (up to 100% detectability and user attribution), and maintain the
best visual perception. By bypassing model retraining and enabling adaptability
to any image, our approach significantly broadens the scope of forgery attacks,
presenting a greater challenge to the security of current watermarking
techniques for diffusion models and the authority of watermarking schemes in
synthetic data generation and governance.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在RTL代码生成中因缺乏高质量训练数据和推理能力而受限，ScaleRTL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过整理多样化的长链式推理数据（3.5B tokens），并对通用推理模型进行微调，结合测试时通过自我反思和修正的扩展策略。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准上，ScaleRTL的表现优于18个竞争基线，分别提高了18.4%和12.7%。

Conclusion: ScaleRTL通过高质量数据和推理扩展策略，显著提升了RTL代码生成的性能，达到最优水平。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human
performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code
generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data.
While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not
fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time
scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL,
the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality
reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of
long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in
a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a
general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable
of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of
ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning
process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning
steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art
performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by
up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

Conclusion: AI需透明整合以增强学生信任和学习效果。

Abstract: As generative AI tools become increasingly integrated into higher education,
understanding how students interact with and perceive these technologies is
essential for responsible and effective adoption. This study evaluates the use
of the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, in undergraduate
civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university.
Using a mixed-methods approach that combines pre- and post-surveys, system
usage logs, and qualitative analysis of the open-ended prompts and questions
students posed to the AI chatbot, the research explores students' perceptions
of trust, ethical concerns, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings reveal
that students appreciated the AI assistant for its convenience and comfort,
with nearly half reporting greater ease in using the AI tool compared to
seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was seen as most
helpful for completing homework and understanding course concepts, though
perceptions of its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical concerns emerged
as a key barrier to full engagement: while most students viewed AI use as
ethically acceptable, many expressed uncertainties about institutional policies
and apprehension about potential academic misconduct. This study contributes to
the growing body of research on AI in education by highlighting the importance
of usability, policy clarity, and faculty guidance in fostering meaningful AI
engagement. The findings suggest that while students are ready to embrace AI as
a supplement to human instruction, thoughtful integration and transparent
institutional frameworks are critical for ensuring student confidence, trust,
and learning effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 探索小型、本地部署的开源LLM在教育领域的应用潜力，解决现有云服务和专有工具的高成本和隐私问题。

Method: 采用3B-7B参数的小型LLM，结合交互式循环和辅助LLM验证器，利用RAG/CAG技术生成高质量教学内容。

Result: 通过实验验证，该框架在数据隐私、成本效益和实用性上表现良好，可与大型模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 小型LLM经过精心设计后可提供高效、安全且经济实惠的教育支持，适用于预算有限的行业。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized as
student-facing educational aids, their potential to directly support educators,
particularly through locally deployable and customizable open-source solutions,
remains significantly underexplored. Many existing educational solutions rely
on cloud-based infrastructure or proprietary tools, which are costly and may
raise privacy concerns. Regulated industries with limited budgets require
affordable, self-hosted solutions. We introduce an end-to-end, open-source
framework leveraging small (3B-7B parameters), locally deployed LLMs for
customized teaching material generation and assessment. Our system uniquely
incorporates an interactive loop crucial for effective small-model refinement,
and an auxiliary LLM verifier to mitigate jailbreaking risks, enhancing output
reliability and safety. Utilizing Retrieval and Context Augmented Generation
(RAG/CAG), it produces factually accurate, customized pedagogically-styled
content. Deployed on-premises for data privacy and validated through an
evaluation pipeline and a college physics pilot, our findings show that
carefully engineered small LLM systems can offer robust, affordable, practical,
and safe educator support, achieving utility comparable to larger models for
targeted tasks.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 现有科学推荐系统（如Google Scholar）的“富者愈富”机制使得少数高影响力论文占据主导，限制了学术多样性和创新，需要改进。

Method: 建议在搜索平台中引入用户特异性校准功能，允许调整流行度、新颖度和相关性权重，并利用词嵌入和大型语言模型增强用户自主性。

Result: 提出了一种通过用户自主调节和新技术应用来优化推荐系统的方案，有望减少学术同质化。

Conclusion: 提升用户自主性的推荐系统设计是推动科学多样性和信息动态性的关键步骤，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science,
are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through
stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths
through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this
``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers
that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm
over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates
structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical
for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to
incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust
the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise
platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in
ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly
pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas
are broadly applicable to information access systems in general. Designing
platforms that increase user autonomy is an important step toward more robust
and dynamic information

Main category: cs.DB

Motivation: 探索预训练执行计划嵌入如何指导SQL查询执行，以实现无需额外训练的查询优化，提升数据库性能。

Method: 介绍LLM-PM框架，嵌入查询默认执行计划，通过k近邻算法找到类似计划，基于邻居投票推荐数据库提示集，辅以一致性检查和回退机制。

Result: 在JOB-CEB基准测试中，LLM-PM平均减少21%查询延迟。

Conclusion: LLM嵌入为查询优化提供实用改进，为无训练的嵌入式优化器指导系统开辟新方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) embeddings offer a promising new avenue for
database query optimization. In this paper, we explore how pre-trained
execution plan embeddings can guide SQL query execution without the need for
additional model training. We introduce LLM-PM (LLM-based Plan Mapping), a
framework that embeds the default execution plan of a query, finds its k
nearest neighbors among previously executed plans, and recommends database
hintsets based on neighborhood voting. A lightweight consistency check
validates the selected hint, while a fallback mechanism searches the full hint
space when needed. Evaluated on the JOB-CEB benchmark using OpenGauss, LLM-PM
achieves an average speed-up of 21% query latency reduction. This work
highlights the potential of LLM-powered embeddings to deliver practical
improvements in query performance and opens new directions for training-free,
embedding-based optimizer guidance systems.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注学习更好的人-物特征，而本文提出一种互补的类别查询学习方法。

Method: 通过转换器解码器将交互类别相关的查询转换为图像特定的类别表示，并通过辅助分类任务进行学习。

Result: 在三个代表性基线方法和两个基准测试上达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、通用且有效，为人-物交互分类任务提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learning better human-object
features, we propose a novel and complementary approach called category query
learning. Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction categories,
converted to image specific category representation via a transformer decoder,
and learnt via an auxiliary image-level classification task. This idea is
motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the
first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification
task. Our method is simple, general and effective. It is validated on three
representative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了GPT-4V在多模态大语言模型中的能力，特别是在图像取证的拼接检测任务中的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 探索GPT-4V在无需任务特定微调的情况下，能否有效检测图像拼接操作，并比较不同提示策略的效果。

Method: 使用三种提示策略（Zero-Shot、Few-Shot和Chain-of-Thought）在CASIA v2.0拼接数据集的一个子集上评估GPT-4V。

Result: GPT-4V在零样本设置下达到85%以上的准确率，CoT提示策略在真实和拼接图像之间表现最平衡。模型还能结合上下文知识分析图像合理性。

Conclusion: GPT-4V虽未超越专用模型，但其通用性、可解释性和推理能力展现了在图像取证中的潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V are capable of reasoning
across text and image modalities, showing promise in a variety of complex
vision-language tasks. In this preliminary study, we investigate the
out-of-the-box capabilities of GPT-4V in the domain of image forensics,
specifically, in detecting image splicing manipulations. Without any
task-specific fine-tuning, we evaluate GPT-4V using three prompting strategies:
Zero-Shot (ZS), Few-Shot (FS), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), applied over a
curated subset of the CASIA v2.0 splicing dataset.
  Our results show that GPT-4V achieves competitive detection performance in
zero-shot settings (more than 85% accuracy), with CoT prompting yielding the
most balanced trade-off across authentic and spliced images. Qualitative
analysis further reveals that the model not only detects low-level visual
artifacts but also draws upon real-world contextual knowledge such as object
scale, semantic consistency, and architectural facts, to identify implausible
composites. While GPT-4V lags behind specialized state-of-the-art splicing
detection models, its generalizability, interpretability, and encyclopedic
reasoning highlight its potential as a flexible tool in image forensics.

Conclusion: 该框架挑战了文化偏见，探讨了数字图像和深度伪造在艺术教育中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have opened the door to new research
perspectives in the domain of art and cultural heritage, where a large number
of artifacts have been digitized. There is a need for innovation to ease the
access and highlight the content of digital collections. Such innovations
develop into creative explorations of the digital image in relation to its
malleability and contemporary interpretation, in confrontation to the original
historical object. Based on the concept of the autonomous image, we propose a
new framework towards the production of self-explaining cultural artifacts
using open-source large-language, face detection, text-to-speech and
audio-to-animation models. The goal is to start from a digitized artwork and to
automatically assemble a short video of the latter where the main character
animates to explain its content. The whole process questions cultural biases
encapsulated in large-language models, the potential of digital images and
deepfakes of artworks for educational purposes, along with concerns of the
field of art history regarding such creative diversions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量评估中常将评分和推理任务分离，导致精度或可解释性不足，需统一优化两者。

Method: 1. 冷启动阶段通过专家设计提示从教师模型蒸馏数据；2. 强化学习微调阶段引入新奖励（GRPO）联合优化评分与推理。

Result: Q-Ponder在评分回归任务中SRCC提升6.5%，并在推理描述任务中超越教师模型Qwen-2.5-VL-72B。

Conclusion: 两阶段框架有效解决了评分和推理的权衡问题，展示了在多任务中的泛化潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can
proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments.
However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning
descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading
to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with
precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability.
This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality
assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing.
To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a
cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage.
Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher
model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via
cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel
reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize
scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived
from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show
that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score
regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain
datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based
SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in
description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization
potential over diverse tasks.

Abstract: Image captioning involves generating textual descriptions from input images,
bridging the gap between computer vision and natural language processing.
Recent advancements in transformer-based models have significantly improved
caption generation by leveraging attention mechanisms for better scene
understanding. While various surveys have explored deep learning-based
approaches for image captioning, few have comprehensively analyzed
attention-based transformer models across multiple languages. This survey
reviews attention-based image captioning models, categorizing them into
transformer-based, deep learning-based, and hybrid approaches. It explores
benchmark datasets, discusses evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr,
and ROUGE, and highlights challenges in multilingual captioning. Additionally,
this paper identifies key limitations in current models, including semantic
inconsistencies, data scarcity in non-English languages, and limitations in
reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions, such as
multimodal learning, real-time applications in AI-powered assistants,
healthcare, and forensic analysis. This survey serves as a comprehensive
reference for researchers aiming to advance the field of attention-based image
captioning.

Motivation: 自动驾驶中视觉语言模型（VLMs）的高延迟和计算开销阻碍了其实时应用，尤其是在时间关键的驾驶场景中。为了解决这一问题，作者旨在通过优化模型推断过程提升效率。

Method: AD-EE是一种基于因果推理的早期退出框架，结合自动驾驶的领域特性，识别最佳退出层以减少不必要的计算。

Conclusion: AD-EE通过优化推断过程显著提升了VLMs在自动驾驶中的实时性和性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, deploying Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to enhance perception and decision-making has become increasingly
common. However, the real-time application of VLMs is hindered by high latency
and computational overhead, limiting their effectiveness in time-critical
driving scenarios. This challenge is particularly evident when VLMs exhibit
over-inference, continuing to process unnecessary layers even after confident
predictions have been reached. To address this inefficiency, we propose AD-EE,
an Early Exit framework that incorporates domain characteristics of autonomous
driving and leverages causal inference to identify optimal exit layers. We
evaluate our method on large-scale real-world autonomous driving datasets,
including Waymo and the corner-case-focused CODA, as well as on a real vehicle
running the Autoware Universe platform. Extensive experiments across multiple
VLMs show that our method significantly reduces latency, with maximum
improvements reaching up to 57.58%, and enhances object detection accuracy,
with maximum gains of up to 44%.

Motivation: 现有AV-LLM和基准测试主要关注静态或2D场景，缺乏对动态3D空间推理的探索，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出SAVVY，分两阶段：(1)利用AV-LLM和其他方法跟踪关键对象的轨迹；(2)构建全局动态地图并通过坐标变换获取最终答案。

Result: SAVVY显著提升了现有AV-LLM的性能，为动态3D空间推理设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAVVY-Bench和SAVVY填补了动态3D空间推理的空白，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic, audio-visual environments is a cornerstone
of human cognition yet remains largely unexplored by existing Audio-Visual
Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) and benchmarks, which predominantly focus on
static or 2D scenes. We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D
spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio.
SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of relationships involving static and
moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D
localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose
SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:
(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as
other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to
the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map
Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and
converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a
final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the
global map with the queried viewpoint. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
SAVVY substantially enhances performance of state-of-the-art AV-LLMs, setting a
new standard and stage for approaching dynamic 3D spatial reasoning in AV-LLMs.

Motivation: 在视觉强化学习中，图像观测往往包含干扰元素（如阴影、云层等），尤其是在训练中未见的干扰情况下，如何高效提取任务相关特征成为一个重要问题。

Method: 提出自预测动态方法（SPD），通过并行使用弱增强和强增强技术，学习逆和正向过渡的表示。

Result: 在MuJoCo视觉控制任务和CARLA自动驾驶任务中，SPD在复杂观测中优于先前研究，且显著提升了未见观测的泛化性能。

Conclusion: SPD方法能高效提取任务相关特征，对未见干扰具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-based reinforcement learning requires efficient and robust
representations of image-based observations, especially when the images contain
distracting (task-irrelevant) elements such as shadows, clouds, and light. It
becomes more important if those distractions are not exposed during training.
We design a Self-Predictive Dynamics (SPD) method to extract task-relevant
features efficiently, even in unseen observations after training. SPD uses weak
and strong augmentations in parallel, and learns representations by predicting
inverse and forward transitions across the two-way augmented versions. In a set
of MuJoCo visual control tasks and an autonomous driving task (CARLA), SPD
outperforms previous studies in complex observations, and significantly
improves the generalization performance for unseen observations. Our code is

Conclusion: Dr. G显著提升了模型在视觉干扰下的泛化能力，适用于真实世界的复杂场景。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been used to efficiently solve
vision-based control tasks in highdimensional image observations. Although
recent MBRL algorithms perform well in trained observations, they fail when
faced with visual distractions in observations. These task-irrelevant
distractions (e.g., clouds, shadows, and light) may be constantly present in
real-world scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised method,
Dream to Generalize (Dr. G), for zero-shot MBRL. Dr. G trains its encoder and
world model with dual contrastive learning which efficiently captures
task-relevant features among multi-view data augmentations. We also introduce a
recurrent state inverse dynamics model that helps the world model to better
understand the temporal structure. The proposed methods can enhance the
robustness of the world model against visual distractions. To evaluate the
generalization performance, we first train Dr. G on simple backgrounds and then
test it on complex natural video backgrounds in the DeepMind Control suite, and
the randomizing environments in Robosuite. Dr. G yields a performance
improvement of 117% and 14% over prior works, respectively. Our code is

Abstract: The rich and multifaceted nature of human social interaction, encompassing
multimodal cues, unobservable relations and mental states, and dynamical
behavior, presents a formidable challenge for artificial intelligence. To
advance research in this area, we introduce SIV-Bench, a novel video benchmark
for rigorously evaluating the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) across Social Scene Understanding (SSU), Social State Reasoning (SSR),
and Social Dynamics Prediction (SDP). SIV-Bench features 2,792 video clips and
8,792 meticulously generated question-answer pairs derived from a human-LLM
collaborative pipeline. It is originally collected from TikTok and YouTube,
covering a wide range of video genres, presentation styles, and linguistic and
cultural backgrounds. It also includes a dedicated setup for analyzing the
impact of different textual cues-original on-screen text, added dialogue, or no
text. Our comprehensive experiments on leading MLLMs reveal that while models
adeptly handle SSU, they significantly struggle with SSR and SDP, where
Relation Inference (RI) is an acute bottleneck, as further examined in our
analysis. Our study also confirms the critical role of transcribed dialogue in
aiding comprehension of complex social interactions. By systematically
identifying current MLLMs' strengths and limitations, SIV-Bench offers crucial
insights to steer the development of more socially intelligent AI. The dataset

Conclusion: 提出的协调攻击策略有效揭示了视觉语言模型的鲁棒性缺陷，为未来研究提供了参考。

Abstract: Vision-language models, which integrate computer vision and natural language
processing capabilities, have demonstrated significant advancements in tasks
such as image captioning and visual question and answering. However, similar to
traditional models, they are susceptible to small perturbations, posing a
challenge to their robustness, particularly in deployment scenarios. Evaluating
the robustness of these models requires perturbations in both the vision and
language modalities to learn their inter-modal dependencies. In this work, we
train a generic surrogate model that can take both image and text as input and
generate joint representation which is further used to generate adversarial
perturbations for both the text and image modalities. This coordinated attack
strategy is evaluated on the visual question and answering and visual reasoning
datasets using various state-of-the-art vision-language models. Our results
indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms other multi-modal attacks and
single-modality attacks from the recent literature. Our results demonstrate
their effectiveness in compromising the robustness of several state-of-the-art
pre-trained multi-modal models such as instruct-BLIP, ViLT and others.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Video classification models is very challenging,
specifically when compared to image-based models. With their increased temporal
dimension, there is a significant increase in complexity and computational
cost. One of the key challenges is to keep the perturbations to a minimum to
induce misclassification. In this work, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement
learning approach (spatial and temporal) that cooperatively learns to identify
the given video's sensitive spatial and temporal regions. The agents consider
temporal coherence in generating fine perturbations, leading to a more
effective and visually imperceptible attack. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions on the Lp metric and the average queries. Our method
enables custom distortion types, making the robustness evaluation more relevant
to the use case. We extensively evaluate 4 popular models for video action
recognition on two popular datasets, HMDB-51 and UCF-101.

Motivation: 探讨CLIP视觉编码器的缺陷是否被语言解码器补偿，以优化视觉语言模型的表现。

Method: 使用三种基于CLIP的视觉语言模型，进行自注意力消融实验。

Result: CLIP视觉表征提供可直接解码的语义信息，语言解码器能在视觉表征不足时补偿性能。

Conclusion: 动态分工设计可优化视觉语言模型，未来可更多依赖语言解码器处理视觉信息。

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of
multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have
various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language
backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by
contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform
controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our
findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer
ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in
scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the
language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover
performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates
future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language
decoder.

Result: 该方法实现了对VLM能力的针对性、可解释性评估。

Conclusion: 新的评估方法为VLM提供了更精细和透明的能力分析。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are now sufficiently advanced to support a
broad range of applications, including answering complex visual questions, and
are increasingly expected to interact with images in varied ways. To evaluate
them, current benchmarks often focus on specific domains (e.g., reading
charts), constructing datasets of annotated real images paired with pre-defined
Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) to report aggregate accuracy scores. However,
such benchmarks entail high annotation costs, risk information leakage, and do
not clarify whether failures stem from limitations in visual perception,
reasoning, or general knowledge. We propose a new evaluation methodology,
inspired by ophthalmologic diagnostics, leveraging procedural generation of
synthetic images to obtain control over visual attributes and precisely reveal
perception failures in VLMs. Specifically, we build collections of images with
gradually more challenging variations in the content of interest (e.g., number
of objects in a counting task) while holding other visual parameters constant.
This diagnostic allows systematic stress testing and fine-grained failure
analysis, shifting the focus from coarse benchmarking toward targeted and
interpretable assessment of VLM capabilities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 当前VLM在自动驾驶应用中存在数据冗余和计算效率低的问题，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 通过构建结构化的NuScenes-S数据集和开发轻量级FastDrive模型（0.9B参数）来解决这些问题。

Result: FastDrive在结构化数据集上表现优异，决策任务准确率提升20%，推理速度提升10倍。

Conclusion: 结构化的数据集和轻量级模型显著提升了自动驾驶任务的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising approach to end-to-end
autonomous driving due to their human-like reasoning capabilities. However,
troublesome gaps remains between current VLMs and real-world autonomous driving
applications. One major limitation is that existing datasets with loosely
formatted language descriptions are not machine-friendly and may introduce
redundancy. Additionally, high computational cost and massive scale of VLMs
hinder the inference speed and real-world deployment. To bridge the gap, this
paper introduces a structured and concise benchmark dataset, NuScenes-S, which
is derived from the NuScenes dataset and contains machine-friendly structured
representations. Moreover, we present FastDrive, a compact VLM baseline with
0.9B parameters. In contrast to existing VLMs with over 7B parameters and
unstructured language processing(e.g., LLaVA-1.5), FastDrive understands
structured and concise descriptions and generates machine-friendly driving
decisions with high efficiency. Extensive experiments show that FastDrive
achieves competitive performance on structured dataset, with approximately 20%
accuracy improvement on decision-making tasks, while surpassing massive
parameter baseline in inference speed with over 10x speedup. Additionally,
ablation studies further focus on the impact of scene annotations (e.g.,
weather, time of day) on decision-making tasks, demonstrating their importance
on decision-making tasks in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在静态图像、狭窄的数学问题解决能力和快速饱和等方面存在不足，无法充分测试多模态推理能力。

Method: 使用程序生成的视频（通过Python脚本、生成视频模型和真实素材）创建MORSE-500基准，涵盖六类推理任务，系统控制难度。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的模型在各类任务中表现不佳，尤其是在抽象和规划任务上。

Conclusion: MORSE-500为透明、可复现和前瞻性研究提供了可持续的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in vision-language models (VLMs), current benchmarks
for multimodal reasoning fall short in three key dimensions. First, they
overwhelmingly rely on static images, failing to capture the temporal
complexity of real-world environments. Second, they narrowly focus on
mathematical problem-solving, neglecting the broader spectrum of reasoning
skills -- including abstract, physical, planning, spatial, and temporal
capabilities -- required for robust multimodal intelligence. Third, many
benchmarks quickly saturate, offering limited headroom for diagnosing failure
modes or measuring continued progress. We introduce MORSE-500 (Multimodal
Reasoning Stress-test Environment), a video benchmark composed of 500 fully
scripted clips with embedded questions spanning six complementary reasoning
categories. Each instance is programmatically generated using deterministic
Python scripts (via Manim, Matplotlib, MoviePy), generative video models, and
curated real footage. This script-driven design allows fine-grained control
over visual complexity, distractor density, and temporal dynamics -- enabling
difficulty to be scaled systematically as models improve. Unlike static
benchmarks that become obsolete once saturated, MORSE-500 is built to evolve:
its controllable generation pipeline supports the creation of arbitrarily
challenging new instances, making it ideally suited for stress-testing
next-generation models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art systems --
including various Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 which represent the strongest
available at the time, alongside strong open-source models -- reveal
substantial performance gaps across all categories, with particularly large
deficits in abstract and planning tasks. We release the full dataset,
generation scripts, and evaluation harness to support transparent,
reproducible, and forward-looking multimodal reasoning research.

Method: 使用不同难度和变化的照片测试111个VLMs和65名人类参与者，采用混合效应模型分析行为。

Result: 94个VLMs表现差于随机猜测，人类表现接近完美。少数表现较好的VLMs受任务难度影响但稳定性高。

Conclusion: VLMs目前缺乏视线推断能力，但仍有潜力成为自然交互技术。

Abstract: Gaze-referential inference--the ability to infer what others are looking
at--is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI
interaction. In a controlled study, we evaluated this skill across 111 Vision
Language Models (VLMs) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and
variability, comparing performance with that of human participants (N = 65),
and analyzed behaviors using mixed-effects models. We found that 94 of the 111
VLMs failed to do better than random guessing, while humans achieved
near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs even respond with each choice almost equally
frequently. Are they randomly guessing? Although most VLMs struggle, when we
zoom in on five of the top-tier VLMs with above-chance performance, we find
that their performance declined with increasing task difficulty but varied only
slightly across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral features
cannot be explained by considering them as random guessers. Instead, they
likely use a combination of heuristics and guessing such that their performance
is subject to the task difficulty but robust to perceptual variations. This
suggests that VLMs, lacking gaze inference capability, have yet to become
technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential
remains.

Result: LVLMs对真实和虚假错觉的回答一致，表明其可能依赖先验知识而非视觉理解。

Conclusion: LVLMs在处理视觉错觉时可能缺乏真正的视觉理解能力，更多依赖于已学知识。

Abstract: Humans are susceptible to optical illusions, which serve as valuable tools
for investigating sensory and cognitive processes. Inspired by human vision
studies, research has begun exploring whether machines, such as large vision
language models (LVLMs), exhibit similar susceptibilities to visual illusions.
However, studies often have used non-abstract images and have not distinguished
actual and apparent features, leading to ambiguous assessments of machine
cognition. To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along
with corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies
between actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same
actual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar
geometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and
fake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and
apparent features. Our findings indicate that although LVLMs may appear to
recognize illusions by correctly answering questions about both feature types,
they predict the same answers for both Genuine Illusion and Fake Illusion VQA
questions. This suggests that their responses might be based on prior knowledge
of illusions rather than genuine visual understanding. The dataset is available

Method: TissUnet模型利用155对MRI-CT扫描训练，在九组数据集中验证，覆盖广泛年龄范围和脑肿瘤患者。

Result: TissUnet在健康成人中的Dice系数中位数为0.79，专家手动注释中为0.83（健康人群）和0.81（肿瘤患者），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TissUnet支持大规模研究，展现了在健康和病理人群中的优异性能。

Abstract: Extracranial tissues visible on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may
hold significant value for characterizing health conditions and clinical
decision-making, yet they are rarely quantified. Current tools have not been
widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying
pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone,
subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI,
with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired
MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering
a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to
AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice
coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second
validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR:
0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted
in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and
TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review
(N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations.
TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial
tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment
effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced autonomous driving, but
existing benchmarks still lack scenario diversity, reliable action-level
annotation, and evaluation protocols aligned with human preferences. To address
these limitations, we introduce DriveAction, the first action-driven benchmark
specifically designed for VLA models, comprising 16,185 QA pairs generated from
2,610 driving scenarios. DriveAction leverages real-world driving data
proactively collected by users of production-level autonomous vehicles to
ensure broad and representative scenario coverage, offers high-level discrete
action labels collected directly from users' actual driving operations, and
implements an action-rooted tree-structured evaluation framework that
explicitly links vision, language, and action tasks, supporting both
comprehensive and task-specific assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that
state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) require both vision and language
guidance for accurate action prediction: on average, accuracy drops by 3.3%
without vision input, by 4.1% without language input, and by 8.0% without
either. Our evaluation supports precise identification of model bottlenecks
with robust and consistent results, thus providing new insights and a rigorous
foundation for advancing human-like decisions in autonomous driving.

Result: 在Aurora-Bench上的动作中心图像编辑任务中表现优异，GPT4o评分提高15%，且人类评价得分最高。

Conclusion: 动态模型可以用于引导世界模型的训练，两者结合在图像编辑任务中取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic
world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a
dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when
actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models
struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model
through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In
turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main
strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference
time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for
unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We
further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are
weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly,
the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model
to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the
world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric
image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance
competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a
margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and
achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.

Motivation: 在线视频内容具有丰富的多模态性（视觉、语音、音频、文本），但现有检索系统通常独立处理各模态导致噪声和性能下降，因此研究如何动态选择最佳模态组合进行检索。

Method: 提出CLaMR多模态检索器，联合编码4种模态并通过统一的多模态骨干网络改进上下文理解；使用合成训练数据集MultiVENT 2.0++和模态感知损失函数进行训练。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0++测试集上，CLaMR比最佳单模态检索器nDCG@10提升了25.6，比最佳多模态检索器提升了35.4；在长视频问答任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CLaMR通过动态模态选择和联合训练显著提高了多模态视频检索性能，适用于长视频问答等下游任务。

Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision,
speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat
these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and
subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where
relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple
modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must
dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the
query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that
jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text,
and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal
backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic
modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training
data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale
synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in
various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we
propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard
contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality
usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation
strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade
performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR
consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR
improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4
over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream
utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50%
boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on
LongVideoBench.

Method: 构建包含 50+ 部电影的 MF$^2$ 基准，每部电影配对手工构造的真实与虚假声明对，要求模型通过二元评估识别真伪。

Result: 实验表明，当前先进模型在 MF$^2$ 上的表现远低于人类，尤其在保留和推理关键叙事信息方面。

Conclusion: MF$^2$ 揭示了当前模型在长视频理解上的不足，尤其是对核心叙事的深层推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs), holistic
understanding of long-form video content remains a significant challenge,
partly due to limitations in current benchmarks. Many focus on peripheral,
``needle-in-a-haystack'' details, encouraging context-insensitive retrieval
over deep comprehension. Others rely on large-scale, semi-automatically
generated questions (often produced by language models themselves) that are
easier for models to answer but fail to reflect genuine understanding. In this
paper, we introduce MF$^2$, a new benchmark for evaluating whether models can
comprehend, consolidate, and recall key narrative information from full-length
movies (50-170 minutes long). MF$^2$ includes over 50 full-length,
open-licensed movies, each paired with manually constructed sets of claim pairs
-- one true (fact) and one plausible but false (fib), totalling over 850 pairs.
These claims target core narrative elements such as character motivations and
emotions, causal chains, and event order, and refer to memorable moments that
humans can recall without rewatching the movie. Instead of multiple-choice
formats, we adopt a binary claim evaluation protocol: for each pair, models
must correctly identify both the true and false claims. This reduces biases
like answer ordering and enables a more precise assessment of reasoning. Our
experiments demonstrate that both open-weight and closed state-of-the-art
models fall well short of human performance, underscoring the relative ease of
the task for humans and their superior ability to retain and reason over
critical narrative information -- an ability current VLMs lack.

Method: 方法包括为LiDAR和雷达数据添加相对于相机的时间戳偏移特征，以及通过数据增强模拟真实传感器延迟模式。

Result: 在多种传感器条件下（同步或延迟），所提方法均表现稳定，而传统方法在传感器数据延迟时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 该模型无关的方法有效解决了传感器时效性问题，提升了自动驾驶感知系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Sensor fusion is crucial for a performant and robust Perception system in
autonomous vehicles, but sensor staleness, where data from different sensors
arrives with varying delays, poses significant challenges. Temporal
misalignment between sensor modalities leads to inconsistent object state
estimates, severely degrading the quality of trajectory predictions that are
critical for safety. We present a novel and model-agnostic approach to address
this problem via (1) a per-point timestamp offset feature (for LiDAR and radar
both relative to camera) that enables fine-grained temporal awareness in sensor
fusion, and (2) a data augmentation strategy that simulates realistic sensor
staleness patterns observed in deployed vehicles. Our method is integrated into
a perspective-view detection model that consumes sensor data from multiple
LiDARs, radars and cameras. We demonstrate that while a conventional model
shows significant regressions when one sensor modality is stale, our approach
reaches consistently good performance across both synchronized and stale
conditions.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了UNet跳跃连接的限制，具有通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with UNet
serving as a milestone architecture. The typical component of UNet family is
the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant
limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different
scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which
constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet
have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations
remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale
feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an
initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By
leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive
ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature
fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures,
making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC,
KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets
demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and
maintained high performance. The code is available at

Method: 提出多模态条件融合模块（结合视觉掩码和文本描述）和跨视角对象对齐模块（增强视角一致性）。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D对象对应基准测试中排名第二。

Conclusion: 方法有效提升了跨视角对象分割的准确性和鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this report, we present a cross-view multi-modal object segmentation
approach for the object correspondence task in the Ego-Exo4D Correspondence
Challenges 2025. Given object queries from one perspective (e.g., ego view),
the goal is to predict the corresponding object masks in another perspective
(e.g., exo view). To tackle this task, we propose a multimodal condition fusion
module that enhances object localization by leveraging both visual masks and
textual descriptions as segmentation conditions. Furthermore, to address the
visual domain gap between ego and exo views, we introduce a cross-view object
alignment module that enforces object-level consistency across perspectives,
thereby improving the model's robustness to viewpoint changes. Our proposed
method ranked second on the leaderboard of the large-scale Ego-Exo4D object
correspondence benchmark. Code will be made available at

Motivation: 旨在通过缓慢分支架构和视觉语言模型，在不影响延迟的情况下生成高级驾驶意图，提升驾驶决策能力。

Method: 采用选择性五视图提示、多阶段思维链提示及样条轨迹后处理技术，优化驾驶决策和轨迹推断。

Conclusion: HMVLM 通过认知启发的架构和技术优化，显著提升了自动驾驶的性能和决策能力。

Abstract: We present HaoMo Vision-Language Model (HMVLM), an end-to-end driving
framework that implements the slow branch of a cognitively inspired fast-slow
architecture. A fast controller outputs low-level steering, throttle, and brake
commands, while a slow planner-a large vision-language model-generates
high-level intents such as "yield to pedestrian" or "merge after the truck"
without compromising latency. HMVLM introduces three upgrades: (1) selective
five-view prompting with an embedded 4s history of ego kinematics, (2)
multi-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting that enforces a Scene
Understanding -> Driving Decision -> Trajectory Inference reasoning flow, and
(3) spline-based trajectory post-processing that removes late-stage jitter and
sharp turns. Trained on the Waymo Open Dataset, these upgrades enable HMVLM to
achieve a Rater Feedback Score (RFS) of 7.7367, securing 2nd place in the 2025
Waymo Vision-based End-to-End (E2E) Driving Challenge and surpassing the public

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 当前半监督分割模型评估仅关注准确性，忽略了可靠性和鲁棒性，而这些对安全关键应用（如自动驾驶）至关重要。

Method: 提出Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS)指标，通过调和平均结合预测准确性、校准性和不确定性质量，全面评估模型。

Result: 实验表明，半监督方法常以牺牲可靠性换取准确性，而UniMatchV2在鲁棒性上表现较好，但可靠性仍不足。

Conclusion: 建议采用更全面的评估指标（如RSS）以更贴近实际应用需求。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is critical for scene understanding but demands costly
pixel-wise annotations, attracting increasing attention to semi-supervised
approaches to leverage abundant unlabeled data. While semi-supervised
segmentation is often promoted as a path toward scalable, real-world
deployment, it is astonishing that current evaluation protocols exclusively
focus on segmentation accuracy, entirely overlooking reliability and
robustness. These qualities, which ensure consistent performance under diverse
conditions (robustness) and well-calibrated model confidences as well as
meaningful uncertainties (reliability), are essential for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, where models must handle unpredictable
environments and avoid sudden failures at all costs. To address this gap, we
introduce the Reliable Segmentation Score (RSS), a novel metric that combines
predictive accuracy, calibration, and uncertainty quality measures via a
harmonic mean. RSS penalizes deficiencies in any of its components, providing
an easy and intuitive way of holistically judging segmentation models.
Comprehensive evaluations of UniMatchV2 against its predecessor and a
supervised baseline show that semi-supervised methods often trade reliability
for accuracy. While out-of-domain evaluations demonstrate UniMatchV2's
robustness, they further expose persistent reliability shortcomings. We
advocate for a shift in evaluation protocols toward more holistic metrics like
RSS to better align semi-supervised learning research with real-world
deployment needs.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 当前基于图像扩散模型的方法难以处理视频的动态性，特别是时间相关的编辑（如运动调整），而直接应用现有视频扩散模型又面临计算资源的高需求问题。

Method: 通过分析视频模型的注意力模式，提出了一种基于频率感知的分解策略，优化各组件分工；并设计了频谱引导的调制方法，避免信息泄漏，支持高效多功能的编辑。

Result: FADE在真实世界视频上实现了高质量、逼真且时间一致的编辑效果，定量和定性实验均表现出色。

Conclusion: FADE无需训练即可充分利用视频扩散模型的先验，为复杂视频编辑提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video
editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts.
However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in
handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like
motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality
results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy
computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image
editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a
training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages
the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware
factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the
attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are
distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose
a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role.
Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling
trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and
supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and
temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that
our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally
coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively. Code is

Motivation: 尽管基于Transformer的运动生成技术取得了进展，但如何在保持高保真度的同时实现实时响应和可扩展性仍是一个挑战。

Method: MOGO包含MoSA-VQ（运动尺度自适应残差向量量化模块）和RQHC-Transformer（残差量化分层因果Transformer），通过单次前向传递生成多层运动标记。

Result: 在HumanML3D、KIT-ML和CMP数据集上的实验表明，MOGO在生成质量和实时性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOGO在运动生成任务中实现了高效、实时和高质量的平衡，尤其在零样本设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based text-to-motion generation have led to
impressive progress in synthesizing high-quality human motion. Nevertheless,
jointly achieving high fidelity, streaming capability, real-time
responsiveness, and scalability remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper,
we propose MOGO (Motion Generation with One-pass), a novel autoregressive
framework tailored for efficient and real-time 3D motion generation. MOGO
comprises two key components: (1) MoSA-VQ, a motion scale-adaptive residual
vector quantization module that hierarchically discretizes motion sequences
with learnable scaling to produce compact yet expressive representations; and
(2) RQHC-Transformer, a residual quantized hierarchical causal transformer that
generates multi-layer motion tokens in a single forward pass, significantly
reducing inference latency. To enhance semantic fidelity, we further introduce
a text condition alignment mechanism that improves motion decoding under
textual control. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including
HumanML3D, KIT-ML, and CMP demonstrate that MOGO achieves competitive or
superior generation quality compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based
methods, while offering substantial improvements in real-time performance,
streaming generation, and generalization under zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有视觉预训练方法假设每张图像包含单一对象，但实际图像可能包含多个对象，限制了方法的扩展性。ODIS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ODIS采用对象级自蒸馏，通过对象感知裁剪和掩码注意力隔离对象特定区域，简化任务为对象子任务。

Result: ODIS在ViT-Large模型上实现了82.6%的k-NN准确率，提升了图像和补丁级别的视觉表示效果。

Conclusion: ODIS通过对象级自蒸馏显著提升了视觉表示的准确性和扩展性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision pretraining methods rely on image-level
self-distillation from object-centric datasets such as ImageNet, implicitly
assuming each image contains a single object. This assumption does not always
hold: many ImageNet images already contain multiple objects. Further, it limits
scalability to scene-centric datasets that better mirror real-world complexity.
We address these challenges by introducing Object-level Self-DIStillation
(ODIS), a pretraining approach that shifts the self-distillation granularity
from whole images to individual objects. Using object-aware cropping and masked
attention, ODIS isolates object-specific regions, guiding the transformer
toward semantically meaningful content and transforming a noisy, scene-level
task into simpler object-level sub-tasks. We show that this approach improves
visual representations both at the image and patch levels. Using masks at
inference time, our method achieves an impressive $82.6\%$ $k$-NN accuracy on
ImageNet1k with ViT-Large.

Abstract: Orthopoxvirus infections must be accurately classified from medical pictures
for an easy and early diagnosis and epidemic prevention. The necessity for
automated and scalable solutions is highlighted by the fact that traditional
diagnostic techniques can be time-consuming and require expert interpretation
and there are few and biased data sets of the different types of Orthopox. In
order to improve classification performance and lower computational costs, a
hybrid strategy is put forth in this paper that uses Machine Learning models
combined with pretrained Deep Learning models to extract deep feature
representations without the need for augmented data. The findings show that
this feature extraction method, when paired with other methods in the
state-of-the-art, produces excellent classification outcomes while preserving
training and inference efficiency. The proposed approach demonstrates strong
generalization and robustness across multiple evaluation settings, offering a
scalable and interpretable solution for real-world clinical deployment.

Abstract: Segmenting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is crucial for many remote
sensing applications, particularly water body detection. However, deep
learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence
speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this
type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on
two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically,
we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining
the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that
mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore,
cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased
stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR

Result: 实验证明HAVIR能有效重建复杂场景中的结构和语义信息，性能优于现有模型。

Conclusion: HAVIR通过互补表示和语义训练，显著提升了视觉刺激重建的准确性。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between
neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in
decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in
accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from
their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and
multifaceted semantic information.
  To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1)
The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior,
capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to
CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These
complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the
final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information
from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions
describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images
synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that
HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic
information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing
models.

Result: GenIR在多轮交互检索中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为心理图像检索任务提供了新方法、数据集和实验基础，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong performance on text-to-image
retrieval benchmarks. However, bridging this success to real-world applications
remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot
action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind,
that is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental
representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task
of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored
setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through
multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful
interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with
clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or
abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective
for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative
multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to
explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic
visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to
refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully
automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing
interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with
a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation
for future research in this direction.

Conclusion: VGA通过分离表示不变推理的挑战，为AI视觉模型迈向类人概念化提供了框架。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have driven
breakthroughs in visual question answering. Yet, a critical gap persists,
`conceptualization'-the ability to recognize and reason about the same concept
despite variations in visual form, a basic ability of human reasoning. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Visual Graph Arena (VGA), a dataset
featuring six graph-based tasks designed to evaluate and improve AI systems'
capacity for visual abstraction. VGA uses diverse graph layouts (e.g.,
Kamada-Kawai vs. planar) to test reasoning independent of visual form.
Experiments with state-of-the-art vision models and multimodal LLMs reveal a
striking divide: humans achieved near-perfect accuracy across tasks, while
models totally failed on isomorphism detection and showed limited success in
path/cycle tasks. We further identify behavioral anomalies suggesting
pseudo-intelligent pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. These
findings underscore fundamental limitations in current AI models for visual
understanding. By isolating the challenge of representation-invariant
reasoning, the VGA provides a framework to drive progress toward human-like
conceptualization in AI visual models. The Visual Graph Arena is available at:

Abstract: Background: The skin prick test (SPT) is the gold standard for diagnosing
sensitization to inhalant allergies. The Skin Prick Automated Test (SPAT)
device was designed for increased consistency in test results, and captures 32
images to be jointly used for allergy wheal detection and delineation, which
leads to a diagnosis.
  Materials and Methods: Using SPAT data from $868$ patients with suspected
inhalant allergies, we designed an automated method to detect and delineate
wheals on these images. To this end, $10,416$ wheals were manually annotated by
drawing detailed polygons along the edges. The unique data-modality of the SPAT
device, with $32$ images taken under distinct lighting conditions, requires a
custom-made approach. Our proposed method consists of two parts: a neural
network component that segments the wheals on the pixel level, followed by an
algorithmic and interpretable approach for detecting and delineating the
wheals.
  Results: We evaluate the performance of our method on a hold-out validation
set of $217$ patients. As a baseline we use a single conventionally lighted
image per SPT as input to our method.
  Conclusion: Using the $32$ SPAT images under various lighting conditions
offers a considerably higher accuracy than a single image in conventional,
uniform light.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上显著提升准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 样本特定的噪声分配是扩散净化方法成功的关键。

Abstract: Diffusion-based purification (DBP) methods aim to remove adversarial noise
from the input sample by first injecting Gaussian noise through a forward
diffusion process, and then recovering the clean example through a reverse
generative process. In the above process, how much Gaussian noise is injected
to the input sample is key to the success of DBP methods, which is controlled
by a constant noise level $t^*$ for all samples in existing methods. In this
paper, we discover that an optimal $t^*$ for each sample indeed could be
different. Intuitively, the cleaner a sample is, the less the noise it should
be injected, and vice versa. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
framework, called Sample-specific Score-aware Noise Injection (SSNI).
Specifically, SSNI uses a pre-trained score network to estimate how much a data
point deviates from the clean data distribution (i.e., score norms). Then,
based on the magnitude of score norms, SSNI applies a reweighting function to
adaptively adjust $t^*$ for each sample, achieving sample-specific noise
injections. Empirically, incorporating our framework with existing DBP methods
results in a notable improvement in both accuracy and robustness on CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1K, highlighting the necessity to allocate distinct noise levels
to different samples in DBP methods. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Data in the form of images or higher-order tensors is ubiquitous in modern
deep learning applications. Owing to their inherent high dimensionality, the
need for subquadratic layers processing such data is even more pressing than
for sequence data. We propose a novel tensor-to-tensor layer with linear cost
in the input size, utilizing the mathematical gadget of ``corner trees'' from
the field of permutation counting. In particular, for order-two tensors, we
provide an image-to-image layer that can be plugged into image processing
pipelines. On the one hand, our method can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of state-space models. On the other hand, it is based on a
multiparameter generalization of the signature of iterated integrals (or sums).
The proposed tensor-to-tensor concept is used to build a neural network layer
called the Fast Iterated Sums (FIS) layer which integrates seamlessly with
other layer types. We demonstrate the usability of the FIS layer with both
classification and anomaly detection tasks. By replacing some layers of a
smaller ResNet architecture with FIS, a similar accuracy (with a difference of
only 0.1\%) was achieved in comparison to a larger ResNet while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and multi-add operations. The FIS layer was also
used to build an anomaly detection model that achieved an average AUROC of
97.3\% on the texture images of the popular MVTec AD dataset. The processing
and modelling codes are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有CNN方法忽略了浅层和深层特征的异质性，未能有效整合多层次特征，导致检测性能受限且计算成本高。

Method: 提出SDS-Net，采用双分支架构分别建模结构特性和语义属性，并通过自适应特征融合模块动态建模跨层特征相关性。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，SDS-Net在检测精度和计算效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SDS-Net通过协同浅层和深层特征，实现了高精度和高效的红外小目标检测，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Current CNN-based infrared small target detection(IRSTD) methods generally
overlook the heterogeneity between shallow and deep features, leading to
inefficient collaboration between shallow fine grained structural information
and deep high-level semantic representations. Additionally, the dependency
relationships and fusion mechanisms across different feature hierarchies lack
systematic modeling, which fails to fully exploit the complementarity of
multilevel features. These limitations hinder IRSTD performance while incurring
substantial computational costs. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes a shallow-deep synergistic detection network (SDS-Net) that
efficiently models multilevel feature representations to increase both the
detection accuracy and computational efficiency in IRSTD tasks. SDS-Net
introduces a dual-branch architecture that separately models the structural
characteristics and semantic properties of features, effectively preserving
shallow spatial details while capturing deep semantic representations, thereby
achieving high-precision detection with significantly improved inference speed.
Furthermore, the network incorporates an adaptive feature fusion module to
dynamically model cross-layer feature correlations, enhancing overall feature
collaboration and representation capability. Comprehensive experiments on three
public datasets (NUAA-SIRST, NUDT-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K) demonstrate that SDS-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods while maintaining low computational
complexity and high inference efficiency, showing superior detection
performance and broad application prospects. Our code will be made public at

### [325] [A Novel Large-scale Crop Dataset and Dual-stream Transformer Method for Fine-grained Hierarchical Crop Classification from Integrated Hyperspectral EnMAP Data and Multispectral Sentinel-2 Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06155)

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决高光谱数据获取困难和标注成本高的问题，同时结合多时相和高光谱数据提升细粒度作物分类性能。

Method: 提出双流Transformer架构，分别处理高光谱（EnMAP）和多时相（Sentinel-2）数据，并通过分层分类头进行多级分类。

Result: 高光谱数据与多时相数据结合使F1值平均提升4.2%，峰值达6.3%，优于现有深度学习方法。

Conclusion: H2Crop数据集和双流Transformer架构为细粒度作物分类和高光谱图像处理提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Fine-grained crop classification is crucial for precision agriculture and
food security monitoring. It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological
dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and
subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from
hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce
currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types
annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical
hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP
hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated
field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a
vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and
hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer
architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates
two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained
signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer
extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed
hierarchy classification heads with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously
delivers multi-level classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments
demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series
yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive
comparisons also confirming our method's higher accuracy over existing deep
learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of
hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过情感分析，可以更好地理解学生的情感反馈，改善在线教育中的师生沟通质量。

Abstract: During the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the educational paradigm has
experienced a major change from in person learning traditional to online
platforms. The change of learning convention has impacted the teacher-student
especially in non-verbal communication. The absent of non-verbal communication
has led to a reliance on verbal feedback which diminished the efficacy of the
educational experience. This paper explores the integration of sentiment
analysis into learning management systems (LMS) to bridge the student-teacher's
gap by offering an alternative approach to interpreting student feedback beyond
its verbal context. The research involves data preparation, feature selection,
and the development of a deep neural network model encompassing word embedding,
LSTM, and attention mechanisms. This model is compared against a logistic
regression baseline to evaluate its efficacy in understanding student feedback.
The study aims to bridge the communication gap between instructors and students
in online learning environments, offering insights into the emotional context
of student feedback and ultimately improving the quality of online education.

Abstract: Scenario building is an established method to anticipate the future of
emerging technologies. Its primary goal is to use narratives to map future
trajectories of technology development and sociotechnical adoption. Following
this process, risks and benefits can be identified early on, and strategies can
be developed that strive for desirable futures. In recent years, computer
science has adopted this method and applied it to various technologies,
including Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because computing technologies play
such an important role in shaping modern societies, it is worth exploring how
scenarios are being used as an anticipatory tool in the field -- and what
possible traditional uses of scenarios are not yet covered but have the
potential to enrich the field. We address this gap by conducting a systematic
literature review on the use of scenario building methods in computer science
over the last decade (n = 59). We guide the review along two main questions.
First, we aim to uncover how scenarios are used in computing literature,
focusing especially on the rationale for why scenarios are used. Second, in
following the potential of scenario building to enhance inclusivity in
research, we dive deeper into the participatory element of the existing
scenario building literature in computer science.

Conclusion: AI角色在情境化评估中具有潜力，其成功使用依赖于信任和社交存在感的建立。

Abstract: While the complexity of 21st-century demands has promoted pedagogical
approaches to foster complex competencies, a persistent gap remains between
in-class learning activities and individualized learning or assessment
practices. To address this, studies have explored the use of AI-generated
characters in learning and assessment. One attempt is scenario-based assessment
(SBA), a technique that not only measures but also fosters the development of
competencies throughout the assessment process. SBA introduces simulated agents
to provide an authentic social-interactional context, allowing for the
assessment of competency-based constructs while mitigating the unpredictability
of real-life interactions. Recent advancements in multimodal AI, such as
text-to-video technology, allow these agents to be enhanced into AI-generated
characters. This mixed-method study investigates how learners perceive AI
characters taking the role of mentor and teammates in an SBA mirroring the
context of a collaborative science investigation. Specifically, we examined the
Likert scale responses of 56 high schoolers regarding trust, social presence,
and effectiveness. We analyzed the relationships between these factors and
their impact on the intention to adopt AI characters through PLS-SEM. Our
findings indicated that learners' trust shaped their sense of social presence
with the AI characters, enhancing perceived effectiveness. Qualitative analysis
further highlighted factors that foster trust, such as material credibility and
alignment with learning goals, as well as the pivotal role of social presence
in creating a collaborative context.

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的普及，需针对老年人等脆弱群体提供定制化的AI素养教育，以帮助他们理解其益处与风险。

Method: 采用混合方法，通过聊天机器人Litti进行干预，并定量评估其对AI素养（知识、安全、伦理）的影响，辅以定性访谈。

Result: 定量结果显示AI素养有改善趋势但不显著，定性访谈揭示了学习意愿强但初始熟悉度差异大。Litti未显著提升信任或安全感。

Conclusion: 为老年人设计AI素养教育存在挑战与机遇，需进一步优化工具与策略。

Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.

Conclusion: CGT框架为大规模定性数据分析提供了一种兼具扩展性和可信度的方法，同时保留了传统扎根理论的严谨性。

Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities
and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social
science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major
challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are
often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this
issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability
limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness
of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the
credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop'
methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the
analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this
in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded
Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while
maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To
illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a
dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors'
experiences in the gig economy.

Abstract: Adaptive recovery from fall incidents are essential skills for the practical
deployment of wheeled-legged robots, which uniquely combine the agility of legs
with the speed of wheels for rapid recovery. However, traditional methods
relying on preplanned recovery motions, simplified dynamics or sparse rewards
often fail to produce robust recovery policies. This paper presents a
learning-based framework integrating Episode-based Dynamic Reward Shaping and
curriculum learning, which dynamically balances exploration of diverse recovery
maneuvers with precise posture refinement. An asymmetric actor-critic
architecture accelerates training by leveraging privileged information in
simulation, while noise-injected observations enhance robustness against
uncertainties. We further demonstrate that synergistic wheel-leg coordination
reduces joint torque consumption by 15.8% and 26.2% and improves stabilization
through energy transfer mechanisms. Extensive evaluations on two distinct
quadruped platforms achieve recovery success rates up to 99.1% and 97.8%
without platform-specific tuning. The supplementary material is available at

Method: 通过EAM利用SBERT和Diffusion模型构建环境属性图，结合MHR模块进行前沿探索决策，优化路径效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，EAM模块在MP3D数据集上达到64.5%的场景映射准确率，导航任务在HM3D和MP3D基准上的SPL分别为28.4%和26.3%，分别比基线方法提升了21.4%和46.0%。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架显著提高了零样本目标导航的成功率和效率。

Abstract: The zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in unknown open-ended environments
coupled with semantically novel target often suffers from the significant
decline in performance due to the neglect of high-dimensional implicit scene
information and the long-range target searching task. To address this, we
proposed an active object navigation framework with Environmental Attributes
Map (EAM) and MLLM Hierarchical Reasoning module (MHR) to improve its success
rate and efficiency. EAM is constructed by reasoning observed environments with
SBERT and predicting unobserved ones with Diffusion, utilizing human space
regularities that underlie object-room correlations and area adjacencies. MHR
is inspired by EAM to perform frontier exploration decision-making, avoiding
the circuitous trajectories in long-range scenarios to improve path efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the EAM module achieves 64.5\% scene
mapping accuracy on MP3D dataset, while the navigation task attains SPLs of
28.4\% and 26.3\% on HM3D and MP3D benchmarks respectively - representing
absolute improvements of 21.4\% and 46.0\% over baseline methods.

Abstract: Modern robot navigation systems encounter difficulties in diverse and complex
indoor environments. Traditional approaches rely on multiple modules with small
models or rule-based systems and thus lack adaptability to new environments. To
address this, we developed Astra, a comprehensive dual-model architecture,
Astra-Global and Astra-Local, for mobile robot navigation. Astra-Global, a
multimodal LLM, processes vision and language inputs to perform self and goal
localization using a hybrid topological-semantic graph as the global map, and
outperforms traditional visual place recognition methods. Astra-Local, a
multitask network, handles local path planning and odometry estimation. Its 4D
spatial-temporal encoder, trained through self-supervised learning, generates
robust 4D features for downstream tasks. The planning head utilizes flow
matching and a novel masked ESDF loss to minimize collision risks for
generating local trajectories, and the odometry head integrates multi-sensor
inputs via a transformer encoder to predict the relative pose of the robot.
Deployed on real in-house mobile robots, Astra achieves high end-to-end mission
success rate across diverse indoor environments.

Result: 在模拟和真实任务中，BEAST显著降低计算成本，生成平滑的高频控制信号，并在任务成功率上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: BEAST是一种高效、兼容性强且能生成平滑轨迹的动作标记器，适用于连续控制任务。

Abstract: We present the B-spline Encoded Action Sequence Tokenizer (BEAST), a novel
action tokenizer that encodes action sequences into compact discrete or
continuous tokens using B-splines. In contrast to existing action tokenizers
based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate
tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling
fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline
formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without
discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by
integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with
discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an
encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and
scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three
established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct
robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference
computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency
control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably
achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous robotic systems have significant potential for
executing complex multi-task missions across space, air, ground, and maritime
domains. But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous
environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile
or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning
algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning
shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when
formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1)
are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location;
2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with
variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board
deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a
novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and
develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and

Abstract: Shape assembly, the process of combining parts into a complete whole, is a
crucial robotic skill with broad real-world applications. Among various
assembly tasks, geometric assembly--where broken parts are reassembled into
their original form (e.g., reconstructing a shattered bowl)--is particularly
challenging. This requires the robot to recognize geometric cues for grasping,
assembly, and subsequent bimanual collaborative manipulation on varied
fragments. In this paper, we exploit the geometric generalization of
point-level affordance, learning affordance aware of bimanual collaboration in
geometric assembly with long-horizon action sequences. To address the
evaluation ambiguity caused by geometry diversity of broken parts, we introduce
a real-world benchmark featuring geometric variety and global reproducibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both
previous affordance-based and imitation-based methods. Project page:

Main category: q-bio.NC

Motivation: 尽管基于相似性匹配的框架在多个领域取得了成功，但其正式的收敛性分析仍不完善。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了一个生物合理的相似性匹配网络，通过多尺度优化框架分析其神经动态、侧向突触动态和前馈突触动态的收敛性。

Result: 证明了网络在不同时间尺度上的指数收敛性，并通过数值实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析和实验验证，为相似性匹配网络提供了完整的收敛性证明。

Abstract: A recent breakthrough in biologically-plausible normative frameworks for
dimensionality reduction is based upon the similarity matching cost function
and the low-rank matrix approximation problem. Despite clear biological
interpretation, successful application in several domains, and experimental
validation, a formal complete convergence analysis remains elusive. Building on
this framework, we consider and analyze a continuous-time neural network, the
\emph{similarity matching network}, for principal subspace projection. Derived
from a min-max-min objective, this biologically-plausible network consists of
three coupled dynamics evolving at different time scales: neural dynamics,
lateral synaptic dynamics, and feedforward synaptic dynamics at the fast,
intermediate, and slow time scales, respectively. The feedforward and lateral
synaptic dynamics consist of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules,
respectively. By leveraging a multilevel optimization framework, we prove
convergence of the dynamics in the offline setting. Specifically, at the first
level (fast time scale), we show strong convexity of the cost function and
global exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics. At
the second level (intermediate time scale), we prove strong concavity of the
cost function and exponential convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow
dynamics within the space of positive definite matrices. At the third and final
level (slow time scale), we study a non-convex and non-smooth cost function,
provide explicit expressions for its global minima, and prove almost sure
convergence of the corresponding gradient-flow dynamics to the global minima.
These results rely on two empirically motivated conjectures that are supported
by thorough numerical experiments. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of
our approach via a numerical example.

Key words: 大型语言模型, 红队测试, AI安全, 产品安全, 威胁模型

TL;DR: 本文认为当前的LLM红队测试研究未聚焦于正确的优先级，应更关注产品安全规格、现实威胁模型及系统级安全性。

<details>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 现有研究未充分优先考虑实际安全问题，需调整研究方向以应对快速发展的AI威胁。

Method: 建议红队测试应聚焦于明确的产品安全规格、现实威胁模型和系统级安全措施。

Result: 调整研究方向将有助于更有效地识别和应对AI模型的新威胁。

Conclusion: 红队测试研究需重新聚焦优先级，以适应AI快速发展带来的新威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safeguards, which implement request refusals, have
become a widely adopted mitigation strategy against misuse. At the intersection
of adversarial machine learning and AI safety, safeguard red teaming has
effectively identified critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art
refusal-trained LLMs. However, in our view the many conference submissions on
LLM red teaming do not, in aggregate, prioritize the right research problems.
First, testing against clear product safety specifications should take a higher
priority than abstract social biases or ethical principles. Second, red teaming
should prioritize realistic threat models that represent the expanding risk
landscape and what real attackers might do. Finally, we contend that
system-level safety is a necessary step to move red teaming research forward,
as AI models present new threats as well as affordances for threat mitigation
(e.g., detection and banning of malicious users) once placed in a deployment
context. Adopting these priorities will be necessary in order for red teaming
research to adequately address the slate of new threats that rapid AI advances
present today and will present in the very near future.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 深度学习系统（如自动驾驶）易受对抗样本攻击，攻击者可能仅能通过查询模型进行黑盒攻击，现有方法难以平衡攻击的多项关键特性。

Method: 提出ECLIPSE方法，结合高斯模糊处理的采样梯度和局部代理模型设计攻击。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，ECLIPSE在鲁棒性、自动检测和人眼隐蔽性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: ECLIPSE为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一种更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning systems, critical in domains like autonomous vehicles, are
vulnerable to adversarial examples (crafted inputs designed to mislead
classifiers). This study investigates black-box adversarial attacks in computer
vision. This is a realistic scenario, where attackers have query-only access to
the target model. Three properties are introduced to evaluate attack
feasibility: robustness to compression, stealthiness to automatic detection,
and stealthiness to human inspection. State-of-the-Art methods tend to
prioritize one criterion at the expense of others. We propose ECLIPSE, a novel
attack method employing Gaussian blurring on sampled gradients and a local
surrogate model. Comprehensive experiments on a public dataset highlight
ECLIPSE's advantages, demonstrating its contribution to the trade-off between
the three properties.

*David Zagardo*

Key words: 1-bit gradient compression, MI-DP, FERRET, privacy, utility, efficiency

TL;DR: FERRET通过1位梯度压缩和互信息差分隐私（MI-DP）实现高效训练，比DPSGD快5倍且困惑度降低3倍。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 研究如何通过1位梯度压缩在保护隐私的同时提高训练效率和模型性能。

Method: 提出FERRET方法，使用Bernoulli掩码传输最多1位符号，并从理论上证明其隐私损失。

Result: FERRET在多个LLM上表现优于DPSGD，困惑度降低2.9倍，训练时间减少19-33%。

Conclusion: 基于符号的MI-DP在隐私、效用和性能三方面取得平衡，FERRET方法无需额外噪声即可提供数学可证明的隐私保护。

Abstract: We revisit 1-bit gradient compression through the lens of mutual-information
differential privacy (MI-DP). Building on signSGD, we propose FERRET--Fast and
Effective Restricted Release for Ethical Training--which transmits at most one
sign bit per parameter group with Bernoulli masking.
  Theory: We prove each fired group leaks at most ln 2 nats; after subsampling
with rate s, the total privacy loss of G groups trained for T steps with firing
probability p is epsilon = G * T * s * p * ln 2. Thus FERRET achieves MI-DP for
epsilon in [0.1, 2] without additive noise.
  Practice: We evaluate three granularities--FERRET-MAX (finest), FERRET-EIGHTH
(medium), and FERRET-2 (coarsest)--on five LLMs (137M-1.8B parameters) against
DPSGD and Non-DP baselines. All methods trained for 1, 3, and 5 epochs.
  Utility: Across all settings, FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH beat DPSGD's perplexity. At
epsilon=0.5, 5 epochs: FERRET-EIGHTH achieves 3.98 perplexity vs DPSGD's 11.61
(2.9x better), within 23% of Non-DP (3.25).
  Privacy: MI-AUC stays at chance for FERRET-MAX/EIGHTH (~0.51), matching DPSGD
vs Non-DP's 0.76-0.99. FERRET-2 shows higher leakage (~0.55) due to lower
headroom.
  Efficiency: Stricter budgets fire fewer signs, so FERRET uses 19-33% of
DPSGD's training time and only 34-36% of Non-DP training time.
  Take-away: Sign-based MI-DP gets closer to achieving all three qualities of
the privacy, utility, performance trilemma: FERRET trains up to 5x faster,
achieves 3x lower perplexity compared to DPSGD and 1.2x greater than Non-DP,
all while providing formal, mathematically provable privacy guarantees using
zero additive noise. The results also show that, in certain instances, masked
1-bit updates can match non-private training utility while safeguarding data.

Result: 提出的攻击方法在几乎所有场景下均优于现有攻击，提高了成功率和效率，并在实际漏洞检测中验证了其安全影响。

Conclusion: 研究证明了增强BCSD模型鲁棒性的紧迫性。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) serves as a fundamental technique for
various software engineering tasks, e.g., vulnerability detection and
classification. Attacks against such models have therefore drawn extensive
attention, aiming at misleading the models to generate erroneous predictions.
Prior works have explored various approaches to generating semantic-preserving
variants, i.e., adversarial samples, to evaluate the robustness of the models
against adversarial attacks. However, they have mainly relied on heuristic
criteria or iterative greedy algorithms to locate salient code influencing the
model output, failing to operate on a solid theoretical basis. Moreover, when
processing programs with high complexities, such attacks tend to be
time-consuming.
  In this work, we propose a novel optimization for adversarial attacks against
BCSD models. In particular, we aim to improve the attacks in a challenging
scenario, where the attack goal is to limit the model predictions to a specific
range, i.e., the targeted attacks. Our attack leverages the superior capability
of black-box, model-agnostic explainers in interpreting the model decision
boundaries, thereby pinpointing the critical code snippet to apply
semantic-preserving perturbations. The evaluation results demonstrate that
compared with the state-of-the-art attacks, the proposed attacks achieve higher
attack success rate in almost all scenarios, while also improving the
efficiency and transferability. Our real-world case studies on vulnerability
detection and classification further demonstrate the security implications of
our attacks, highlighting the urgent need to further enhance the robustness of
existing BCSD models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly powerful but remain vulnerable
to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs cause the model to deviate
from its intended instructions. This paper introduces Sentinel, a novel
detection model, qualifire/prompt-injection-sentinel, based on the
\answerdotai/ModernBERT-large architecture. By leveraging ModernBERT's advanced

performance. This dataset amalgamates varied attack types, from role-playing
and instruction hijacking to attempts to generate biased content, alongside a
broad spectrum of benign instructions, with private datasets specifically
targeting nuanced error correction and real-world misclassifications. On a
comprehensive, unseen internal test set, Sentinel demonstrates an average
accuracy of 0.987 and an F1-score of 0.980. Furthermore, when evaluated on
public benchmarks, it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2. This work details Sentinel's

Conclusion: StealthInk 是大型语言模型水印应用的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking for large language models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to
identifying AI-generated text. Existing approaches, however, either compromise
the distribution of original generated text by LLMs or are limited to embedding
zero-bit information that only allows for watermark detection but ignores
identification. We present StealthInk, a stealthy multi-bit watermarking scheme
that preserves the original text distribution while enabling the embedding of
provenance data, such as userID, TimeStamp, and modelID, within LLM-generated
text. This enhances fast traceability without requiring access to the language
model's API or prompts. We derive a lower bound on the number of tokens
necessary for watermark detection at a fixed equal error rate, which provides
insights on how to enhance the capacity. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse tasks highlight the stealthiness, detectability, and resilience
of StealthInk, establishing it as an effective solution for LLM watermarking
applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, deploying
these models introduces critical risks related to intellectual property
violations and potential misuse, particularly as adversaries can imitate these
models to steal services or generate misleading outputs. We specifically focus
on model stealing attacks, as they are highly relevant to proprietary LLMs and
pose a serious threat to their security, revenue, and ethical deployment. While
various watermarking techniques have emerged to mitigate these risks, it
remains unclear how far the community and industry have progressed in
developing and deploying watermarks in LLMs.
  To bridge this gap, we aim to develop a comprehensive systematization for
watermarks in LLMs by 1) presenting a detailed taxonomy for watermarks in LLMs,
2) proposing a novel intellectual property classifier to explore the
effectiveness and impacts of watermarks on LLMs under both attack and
attack-free environments, 3) analyzing the limitations of existing watermarks
in LLMs, and 4) discussing practical challenges and potential future directions
for watermarks in LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we show that despite
promising research outcomes and significant attention from leading companies
and community to deploy watermarks, these techniques have yet to reach their
full potential in real-world applications due to their unfavorable impacts on
model utility of LLMs and downstream tasks. Our findings provide an insightful
understanding of watermarks in LLMs, highlighting the need for practical
watermarks solutions tailored to LLM deployment.

Abstract: The code generation capabilities of large language models(LLMs) have emerged
as a critical dimension in evaluating their overall performance. However, prior
research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated
code. In this work, we introduce \benchmark, a benchmark specifically designed
to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide

Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that
leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging
to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code.
Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on \benchmark, we
reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free
code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights
for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在客户支持、内容生成和代码辅助等领域广泛应用，但易受提示注入攻击，传统防御方法繁琐或无效，需要一种新的轻型防御机制。

Method: 提出PPA，通过动态改变系统提示结构，使攻击者难以预测提示结构，从而防御提示注入攻击。

Result: 实验表明PPA能有效防御现有攻击，且性能优于其他防御方法。

Conclusion: PPA是一种高效且轻量级的防御方法，能在不影响性能的情况下提升安全性。

Abstract: LLM agents are widely used as agents for customer support, content
generation, and code assistance. However, they are vulnerable to prompt
injection attacks, where adversarial inputs manipulate the model's behavior.
Traditional defenses like input sanitization, guard models, and guardrails are
either cumbersome or ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel,
lightweight defense mechanism called Polymorphic Prompt Assembling (PPA), which
protects against prompt injection with near-zero overhead. The approach is
based on the insight that prompt injection requires guessing and breaking the
structure of the system prompt. By dynamically varying the structure of system
prompts, PPA prevents attackers from predicting the prompt structure, thereby
enhancing security without compromising performance. We conducted experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of PPA against existing attacks and compared it
with other defense methods.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of deep learning technology, pre-trained encoder
models have demonstrated exceptional feature extraction capabilities, playing a
pivotal role in the research and application of deep learning. However, their
widespread use has raised significant concerns about the risk of training data
privacy leakage. This paper systematically investigates the privacy threats
posed by membership inference attacks (MIAs) targeting encoder models, focusing
on contrastive learning frameworks. Through experimental analysis, we reveal
the significant impact of model architecture complexity on membership privacy
leakage: As more advanced encoder frameworks improve feature-extraction
performance, they simultaneously exacerbate privacy-leakage risks. Furthermore,
this paper proposes a novel membership inference attack method based on the
p-norm of feature vectors, termed the Embedding Lp-Norm Likelihood Attack
(LpLA). This method infers membership status, by leveraging the statistical
distribution characteristics of the p-norm of feature vectors. Experimental
results across multiple datasets and model architectures demonstrate that LpLA
outperforms existing methods in attack performance and robustness, particularly
under limited attack knowledge and query volumes. This study not only uncovers
the potential risks of privacy leakage in contrastive learning frameworks, but
also provides a practical basis for privacy protection research in encoder
models. We hope that this work will draw greater attention to the privacy risks
associated with self-supervised learning models and shed light on the
importance of a balance between model utility and training data privacy. Our
code is publicly available at: https://github.com/SeroneySun/LpLA_code.

Abstract: Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in
artificial intelligence.Foundation models are large models, trained on broad
data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without
fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers
(ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications.
However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces
significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive
AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability.This paper studies the
vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and
ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream
tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of
transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification,
captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

Abstract: The growing adoption of large pre-trained models in edge computing has made
deploying model inference on mobile clients both practical and popular. These
devices are inherently vulnerable to direct adversarial attacks, which pose a
substantial threat to the robustness and security of deployed models. Federated
adversarial training (FAT) has emerged as an effective solution to enhance
model robustness while preserving client privacy. However, FAT frequently
produces a generalized global model, which struggles to address the diverse and
heterogeneous data distributions across clients, resulting in insufficiently
personalized performance, while also encountering substantial communication
challenges during the training process. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sylva}, a personalized collaborative adversarial training framework
designed to deliver customized defense models for each client through a
two-phase process. In Phase 1, \textit{Sylva} employs LoRA for local
adversarial fine-tuning, enabling clients to personalize model robustness while
drastically reducing communication costs by uploading only LoRA parameters
during federated aggregation. In Phase 2, a game-based layer selection strategy
is introduced to enhance accuracy on benign data, further refining the
personalized model. This approach ensures that each client receives a tailored
defense model that balances robustness and accuracy effectively. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that \textit{Sylva} can achieve
up to 50$\times$ improvements in communication efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving up to 29.5\% and 50.4\%
enhancements in adversarial robustness and benign accuracy, respectively.

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of data analysis that is particularly suited to
identifying coherent subgroups or substructures in unlabeled data, as are
generated continuously in large amounts these days. However, in many cases
traditional clustering methods are not applicable, because data are
increasingly being produced and stored in a distributed way, e.g. on edge
devices, and privacy concerns prevent it from being transferred to a central
server. To address this challenge, we present \acronym, a new algorithm for
$k$-means clustering that is fully-federated as well as differentially private.
Our approach leverages (potentially small and out-of-distribution) server-side
data to overcome the primary challenge of differentially private clustering
methods: the need for a good initialization. Combining our initialization with
a simple federated DP-Lloyds algorithm we obtain an algorithm that achieves
excellent results on synthetic and real-world benchmark tasks. We also provide
a theoretical analysis of our method that provides bounds on the convergence
speed and cluster identification success.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external corpora before generating
responses. This approach significantly expands LLM capabilities by leveraging
vast, up-to-date external knowledge. However, this reliance on external
knowledge makes RAG systems vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that
manipulate generated outputs via poisoned document injection. Existing
poisoning attack strategies typically treat the retrieval and generation stages
as disjointed, limiting their effectiveness. We propose Joint-GCG, the first
framework to unify gradient-based attacks across both retriever and generator
models through three innovations: (1) Cross-Vocabulary Projection for aligning
embedding spaces, (2) Gradient Tokenization Alignment for synchronizing
token-level gradient signals, and (3) Adaptive Weighted Fusion for dynamically
balancing attacking objectives. Evaluations demonstrate that Joint-GCG achieves
at most 25% and an average of 5% higher attack success rate than previous
methods across multiple retrievers and generators. While optimized under a
white-box assumption, the generated poisons show unprecedented transferability
to unseen models. Joint-GCG's innovative unification of gradient-based attacks
across retrieval and generation stages fundamentally reshapes our understanding
of vulnerabilities within RAG systems. Our code is available at

Abstract: Model stealing poses a significant security risk in machine learning by
enabling attackers to replicate a black-box model without access to its
training data, thus jeopardizing intellectual property and exposing sensitive
information. Recent methods that use pre-trained diffusion models for data
synthesis improve efficiency and performance but rely heavily on manually
crafted prompts, limiting automation and scalability, especially for attackers
with little expertise. To assess the risks posed by open-source pre-trained
models, we propose a more realistic threat model that eliminates the need for
prompt design skills or knowledge of class names. In this context, we introduce
Stealix, the first approach to perform model stealing without predefined
prompts. Stealix uses two open-source pre-trained models to infer the victim
model's data distribution, and iteratively refines prompts through a genetic
algorithm, progressively improving the precision and diversity of synthetic
images. Our experimental results demonstrate that Stealix significantly
outperforms other methods, even those with access to class names or
fine-grained prompts, while operating under the same query budget. These
findings highlight the scalability of our approach and suggest that the risks
posed by pre-trained generative models in model stealing may be greater than
previously recognized.
