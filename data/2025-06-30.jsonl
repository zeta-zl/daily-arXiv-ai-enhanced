By\nphysically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS\nsystem, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for\ngeneration of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the\ngenerated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of\nlandmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This\nerror-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous\nlandmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage\nthe error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we\npropose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)\nfor coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding\nforce in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries.

Applying the Decision\nTransformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential\nmodeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term\ndependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior.

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step\nprocess: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on\nstate and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the\ntraining set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training\nset) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the\ncurrent state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,\nwe generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)\nto augment our training dataset.

This study makes four\nkey contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset\nfor Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,\nUnrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological\nfoundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman\nUrdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based\ntransformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman\nUrdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the\nstatistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed\nmodel, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of\n0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%\nand 2.63% respectively."}

To achieve this, existing\nmethods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a\ntest-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate\nresponses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations\nin prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations\ncan be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained\nsparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of\nmultiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this\nanswer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be\ndown-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the\nsparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent\nreasoning."}

Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by\ndirectly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on\nmodel-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create\nsemantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via\nembedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to\ngenerate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for\nhypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,\ndemonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical\nguideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a\nlightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This\nwork provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding\nmedical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong\npotential for broader clinical deployment."}

This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech\ngeneration with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.\nExperimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,\nand emotional fidelity."}

To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy\ncan be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.\nTherefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM\ntraining."}

The reward formulation\nintegrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a\ntuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity\ngain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both\nintra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and\nminimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies\nPareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each\niteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach\nsignificantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating\nits potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation\nsettings."}

Although autoregressive systems\nexhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token\ngeneration mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of\nsynthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video\ndubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces\nIndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for\nspeech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows\nexplicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration\ncontrol; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely\ngenerate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input\nprompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional\nexpression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and\nemotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the\nemotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a\nseparate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to\nreconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance\nclarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent\nrepresentations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier\nfor emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual\ndescriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech\ngeneration with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.\nExperimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,\nand emotional fidelity."}

RC enhances answer aggregation by not\nonly considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate\nresponse set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations\nwhile generating the set of responses leading to each answer.

Importantly, our method only uses cached\nactivations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional\nmodel queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four\nreasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task\nperformance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)\nover strong test-time scaling baselines.

Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that\nsyntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and\neffectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new\nbenchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the\nprevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for\nhigh-performing text classification."}

In this paper, we define two\ntypes of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and\ninference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase\nevaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single\nverifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across\ndifferent query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically\nsensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or\nideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset\nspanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question\ntypes. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,\nwhile Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and\nquery language.

For example, cloud computing resources\nare evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network\nbandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to\ncapture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we\nstudy two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up\nto c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods\n(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'\npreferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each\ndimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a\ndifferent set of goods from the envied agent's allocation.

We provide\nupper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the\nexistence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are\nindependent of the total number of items.

To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed.

Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs\npreserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and\ngenerate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a\nseparate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response\nlatency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available\npaired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs\ncompared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To\naddress this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality\nexpert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk\nfirst adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality\nload within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized\nsingle-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.\nAs a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the\noriginal LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of\nover 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par\nwith modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within\n0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/talkking/DeepTalk."}

However, this problem\nremains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image\ndomain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)\nfor OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that\npoint cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size\nand object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they\noften contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a\nsubstantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks\ninvolving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,\nour empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift\nsignificantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text\nembeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To\naddress this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the\ndetection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation\nscheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets\nand problem settings."}

We validate both models experimentally and find\nthat they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,\nincluding the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing\nProblem (CVRP)."}

This paper introduces a\nsimple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level\nspatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual\nprompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning\ntasks.

DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists\nof (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or\npatch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural\ngeneralization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,\nMixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication\npatterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the\ncontent and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by\nfurther requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory\nefficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are\ncompetitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute\nefficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the\nemergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find\nthat the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed\naccording to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of\nmodules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models\nlearn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way."}

Under submission", "summary": "Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in\nlarge language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.\nWhile training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime\noptimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive\ndecoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,\nand speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or\ndisrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,\ntoken-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time\nwithout altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four\nsynergistic mechanisms:\n  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged\nrepresentations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory\nwrites to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which\ncollapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.\n  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on\nfrozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and\nLlama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP\nreduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2)."}

Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering\nout-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as\nwidefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.\nComputational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to\ncheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off\ntells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high\nPSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.\nExisting methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or\nproduce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In\nthis work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light\nmicroscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to\nfind a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the\nrealism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the\nconditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a\nhazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on\n5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion\nand perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a\nconsistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with\ncalibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated\npredictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation\noperator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data.

In CFL, clients are naturally grouped\ninto clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these\nclusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes\nclient embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the\ninsight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those\nin different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these\nembeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from\ndifferent clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated\naggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its\nsimplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,\nand (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model\ninitialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world\napplications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE\ncan recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and\nconverges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our\ncomprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic\nPersonalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets\nand an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves\nhighly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with\nstate-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and\nunsupervised PFL tasks."}
