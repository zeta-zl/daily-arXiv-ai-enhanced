Although recent studies have shown that\nprivacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different\nsubgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of\nanonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\\ell$-diversity, and\n$t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we\nsystematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness,\nevaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals\nthat anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to four orders of\nmagnitude. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to\nimprove under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input\nhomogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse\nprivacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights\ninto the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable\nguidelines for responsible AI development.

To circumvent the efficiency barrier\nof naively proving machine learning inferences in zero-knowledge, our key\ninnovation is a new approach to measure fairness only with model parameters and\nsome aggregated information of the input, but not on any specific dataset. To\nachieve this goal, we derive new bounds for the fairness of logistic regression\nand deep neural network models that are tighter and better reflecting the\nfairness compared to prior work. Moreover, we develop efficient zero-knowledge\nproof protocols for common computations involved in measuring fairness,\nincluding the spectral norm of matrices, maximum, absolute value, and\nfixed-point arithmetic.\n  We have fully implemented our system, FairZK, that proves machine learning\nfairness in zero-knowledge.

By relaxing the\nexisting causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a\nminimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to\naddress the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual\nreasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed\nanomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous\ndecision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal\ngraphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This\nenables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables\nand lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the\ncausal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based\non counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP)\nalgorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking\ncosts into account.

Moreover, the\nlearned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not\npresent or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit\nlimited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based\nPessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis\nto generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for\ntraining both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety\nclassifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also\nprovides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize\npessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost,\nwhich mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize\nunsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors.\nMoreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation.\nExtensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm\nachieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks,\nparticularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety."}

The system\nutilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert textual\nimages into machine-readable text, thereby enabling the Wazobia system to\naccept both input text and textual images for extraction purposes. The system\nachieved a performance of 0.9511 in precision, 0.9400 in recall, 0.9564 in\nF1-score, and 0.9301 in accuracy. The model's evaluation was conducted across\nthree languages, with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as key\nassessment metrics. The Wazobia-NER system demonstrates that it is feasible to\nbuild robust NER tools for under-resourced African languages using current NLP\nframeworks and transfer learning."}

For example, prior works have\napplied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch\nonline RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from\nthe autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This\nraises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics.\nMotivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three\naxes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy\nexpressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with\nthe amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several\nobservations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch\nonline RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods.\nBuilding on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via\nchoosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over\ntraditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an\nexpressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based\non this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL.

Molecular\nline ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics\nin these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9\ndifferent molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection\nbetween the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen\nchemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated\nusing UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and\ncarbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a\nclassical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning,\nnamely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order\ndependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the\nUniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction\nmethod to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the\nparameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate\nall input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are\nthe most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important\nin parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different\ntypes of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly\nsensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the\ntemperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to\nbe sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for\nthis parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen\nabundance."}

A core challenge in CL\nis balancing stability -- preserving performance on old tasks -- and plasticity\n-- adapting to new ones.

However, their high\ncomputational cost at inference time limits their practicality in real-world\napplications, especially those requiring low latency or energy efficiency. To\naddress this issue, we explore model compression techniques, including pruning\nand knowledge distillation (KD), and propose two efficient frameworks tailored\nfor class-incremental learning (CIL), a challenging CL setting where task\nidentities are unavailable during inference. The pruning-based framework\nincludes pre- and post-pruning strategies that apply compression at different\ntraining stages. The KD-based framework adopts a teacher-student architecture,\nwhere a large pre-trained teacher transfers downstream-relevant knowledge to a\ncompact student.

Our findings\nhighlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving,\noffering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model\ndevelopment. Our code is available at https://github.com/LithiumDA/CodePDE."}
