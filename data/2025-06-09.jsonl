We first developed a robust\nannotation guideline for extracting clinically meaningful outcomes from text\nthrough iteration and discussion with clinicians and Natural Language\nProcessing experts. Then, three independent annotators annotated the Results\nand Conclusions sections of a randomly selected sample of 500 PubMed abstracts\nand 140 PubMed abstracts from the existing EBM-NLP corpus.

This paper introduces Contextual Memory\nIntelligence (CMI) as a new foundational paradigm for building intelligent\nsystems. It repositions memory as an adaptive infrastructure necessary for\nlongitudinal coherence, explainability, and responsible decision-making rather\nthan passive data. Drawing on cognitive science, organizational theory,\nhuman-computer interaction, and AI governance, CMI formalizes the structured\ncapture, inference, and regeneration of context as a fundamental system\ncapability.

In this work, we propose a new dataset to\nspecifically empower researchers to study the dual processes of fact\nmemorization and verbatim sequence memorization. The dataset consists of\nsynthetically-generated, webtext-like documents about fictional events, as well\nas question-answer pairs about the events. We conduct training experiments\nshowing how synthetic data about fictional events can be effective in teasing\napart different forms of memorization. We also document the challenges in\neffectively building realistic, fictional synthetic data."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose\nSAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages:\n(i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as\nother audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to\nthe query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map\nConstruction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and\nconverts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a\nfinal QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the\nglobal map with the queried viewpoint.

On the\n\\textsc{Text2Chart31} benchmark, our system reduces execution errors to 4.5\\%\nwithin three repair iterations, outperforming the strongest fine-tuned baseline\nby nearly 5 percentage points while requiring significantly less compute.\nSimilar performance is observed on the \\textsc{ChartX} benchmark, with an error\nrate of 4.6\\%, demonstrating strong generalization. Under current benchmarks,\nexecution success appears largely solved. However, manual review reveals that 6\nout of 100 sampled charts contain hallucinations, and an LLM-based\naccessibility audit shows that only 33.3\\% (\\textsc{Text2Chart31}) and 7.2\\%\n(\\textsc{ChartX}) of generated charts satisfy basic colorblindness guidelines.\nThese findings suggest that future work should shift focus from execution\nreliability toward improving chart aesthetics, semantic fidelity, and\naccessibility."}

We explore an alternative: training a smaller KV cache offline on\neach corpus. At inference time, we load this trained KV cache, which we call a\nCartridge, and decode a response. Critically, the cost of training a Cartridge\ncan be amortized across all the queries referencing the same corpus. However,\nwe find that the naive approach of training the Cartridge with next-token\nprediction on the corpus is not competitive with ICL. Instead, we propose\nself-study, a training recipe in which we generate synthetic conversations\nabout the corpus and train the Cartridge with a context-distillation objective.\nWe find that Cartridges trained with self-study replicate the functionality of\nICL, while being significantly cheaper to serve.

To address these limitations, we introduce a visual question\nanswering (VQA) dataset, categorized into genuine and fake illusions, along\nwith corresponding control images. Genuine illusions present discrepancies\nbetween actual and apparent features, whereas fake illusions have the same\nactual and apparent features even though they look illusory due to the similar\ngeometric configuration. We evaluate the performance of LVLMs for genuine and\nfake illusion VQA tasks and investigate whether the models discern actual and\napparent features.

Specifically, PersonaAgent integrates two\ncomplementary components - a personalized memory module that includes episodic\nand semantic memory mechanisms; a personalized action module that enables the\nagent to perform tool actions tailored to the user. At the core, the persona\n(defined as unique system prompt for each user) functions as an intermediary:\nit leverages insights from personalized memory to control agent actions, while\nthe outcomes of these actions in turn refine the memory. Based on the\nframework, we propose a test-time user-preference alignment strategy that\nsimulate the latest n interactions to optimize the persona prompt, ensuring\nreal-time user preference alignment through textual loss feedback between\nsimulated and ground-truth responses. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nPersonaAgent significantly outperforms other baseline methods by not only\npersonalizing the action space effectively but also scaling during test-time\nreal-world applications. These results underscore the feasibility and potential\nof our approach in delivering tailored, dynamic user experiences."}

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning. Our results show that despite its simplicity, FARMS uniformly\nimproves the accuracy of eigenspectrum analysis while enabling more effective\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment in these application domains. In one of\nthe LLM pruning experiments, FARMS reduces the perplexity of the LLaMA-7B model\nby 17.3% when compared with the state-of-the-art method."}
