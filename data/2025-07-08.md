### [1] [Loki's Dance of Illusions: A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02870)
*Chaozhuo Li,Pengbo Wang,Chenxu Wang,Litian Zhang,Zheng Liu,Qiwei Ye,Yuanbo Xu,Feiran Huang,Xi Zhang,Philip S. Yu*

Key words: 大型语言模型(LLMs), 幻觉问题, 信息不对称, 检测方法, 解决方案

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)中的幻觉问题，包括其成因、检测方法和解决方案，特别是在认知和信息不对称的条件下，如何揭示其底层逻辑并开发创新方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: LLMs虽然具备强大的语言生成能力，但经常产生看似准确实则虚构的信息（即幻觉），这可能误导用户，并在金融、法律和医疗等领域造成严重后果，因此需要系统性研究。

Method: 通过系统分类和分析LLM幻觉的成因、检测方法和解决方案，尤其关注理解幻觉的根源和评估当前策略的效力。

Result: 研究揭示了幻觉问题的底层逻辑，并评估了现有方法的有效性，为开发新的解决方案奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本研究旨在推动对LLM幻觉问题的全面解决策略，强调理解其成因和开发创新方法的重要性。

Abstract: Edgar Allan Poe noted, "Truth often lurks in the shadow of error,"
highlighting the deep complexity intrinsic to the interplay between truth and
falsehood, notably under conditions of cognitive and informational asymmetry.
This dynamic is strikingly evident in large language models (LLMs). Despite
their impressive linguistic generation capabilities, LLMs sometimes produce
information that appears factually accurate but is, in reality, fabricated, an
issue often referred to as 'hallucinations'. The prevalence of these
hallucinations can mislead users, affecting their judgments and decisions. In
sectors such as finance, law, and healthcare, such misinformation risks causing
substantial economic losses, legal disputes, and health risks, with
wide-ranging consequences.In our research, we have methodically categorized,
analyzed the causes, detection methods, and solutions related to LLM
hallucinations. Our efforts have particularly focused on understanding the
roots of hallucinations and evaluating the efficacy of current strategies in
revealing the underlying logic, thereby paving the way for the development of
innovative and potent approaches. By examining why certain measures are
effective against hallucinations, our study aims to foster a comprehensive
approach to tackling this issue within the domain of LLMs.

### [2] [ChatGPT is not A Man but Das Man: Representativeness and Structural Consistency of Silicon Samples Generated by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02919)
*Dai Li,Linzhuo Li,Huilian Sophie Qiu*

Key words: 大型语言模型，结构不一致性，同质化，意见模拟，政策误导

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（如ChatGPT和Llama）在模拟人类意见时存在结构不一致和同质化问题，导致对少数群体意见的低估，可能误导政策。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否适合作为‘硅样品’模拟人类群体意见，以及其在人口统计层面的表现。

Method: 使用ChatGPT（GPT-4）和Meta的Llama 3.1系列（8B、70B、405B），通过ANES 2020中的堕胎和非法移民问题测试其回答。

Result: 发现LLMs在回答中存在显著的结构不一致性和同质化现象，与人类数据相比，低估了少数意见。

Conclusion: LLMs（尤其是聊天机器人AI）不能直接替代人类调查数据，可能强化刻板印象并误导政策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in the form of chatbots like ChatGPT and Llama
are increasingly proposed as "silicon samples" for simulating human opinions.
This study examines this notion, arguing that LLMs may misrepresent
population-level opinions. We identify two fundamental challenges: a failure in
structural consistency, where response accuracy doesn't hold across demographic
aggregation levels, and homogenization, an underrepresentation of minority
opinions. To investigate these, we prompted ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Meta's Llama
3.1 series (8B, 70B, 405B) with questions on abortion and unauthorized
immigration from the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020. Our
findings reveal significant structural inconsistencies and severe
homogenization in LLM responses compared to human data. We propose an
"accuracy-optimization hypothesis," suggesting homogenization stems from
prioritizing modal responses. These issues challenge the validity of using
LLMs, especially chatbots AI, as direct substitutes for human survey data,
potentially reinforcing stereotypes and misinforming policy.

### [3] [A Unified Speech LLM for Diarization and Speech Recognition in Multilingual Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02927)
*Phurich Saengthong,Boonnithi Jiaramaneepinit,Sheng Li,Manabu Okumura,Takahiro Shinozaki*

Key words: 语音大语言模型,说话人分割,自动语音识别,多语言对话

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的语音大语言模型，用于联合完成说话人分割和自动语音识别任务，并在多语言对话数据上取得了显著的性能提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统语音大语言模型在多语言实际对话中因数据稀缺而效果受限，因此研究旨在通过改进数据格式和推理过程来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过重新设计训练数据格式和改进推理过程，提出了一种端到端的统一语音大语言模型，联合完成说话人分割和语音识别。

Result: 模型在Task II中取得了54.87%的相对性能提升，排名第8，尽管使用了较小的LLM骨干网络。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言对话任务中表现优异，表明其在复杂语音场景中的潜力。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm
in recent years, extending the capabilities of traditional LLMs to speech tasks
such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken dialogue modeling.
However, their effectiveness in real-world multilingual conversations remains
limited by the scarcity of data that captures natural conversational phenomena.
To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational
dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task
I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II).
In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that
jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating
the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model
addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\%
relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall,
despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using
a fine-tuned speech LLM.

### [4] [Mitigating Hidden Confounding by Progressive Confounder Imputation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02928)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决观测数据中隐藏混杂因子导致的因果估计偏差问题，利用LLMs的潜力填补现有方法依赖无混杂假设的不足。

Method: 提出ProCI框架，通过LLMs的语义推理和世界知识能力，迭代生成和验证隐藏混杂因子，并采用分布推理策略提高鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，ProCI能够发现有意义的混杂因子，并在多种数据集和LLMs上显著改善了因果效应估计。

Conclusion: ProCI首次尝试利用LLMs处理隐藏混杂因子问题，展示了LLMs在因果推理中的潜力。

Abstract: Hidden confounding remains a central challenge in estimating treatment
effects from observational data, as unobserved variables can lead to biased
causal estimates. While recent work has explored the use of large language
models (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the
unconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
mitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive
Confounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world
knowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden
confounders. ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong
semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible
confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded
world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent
confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning
strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders
and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets
and LLMs.

### [5] [Theory of Mind in Action: The Instruction Inference Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02935)
*Fardin Saad,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah,Munindar P. Singh*

Key words: ToM, Instruction Inference, Tomcat, LLM, Fs-CoT, CP

TL;DR: 研究通过Instruction Inference任务评估AI的ToM能力，提出Tomcat代理，采用Fs-CoT和CP两种方法，在GPT-4o等模型上测试，性能接近人类水平。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 评估AI在动态协作环境中的ToM能力，以促进人机合作。

Method: 设计Tomcat代理，基于Fs-CoT和CP方法，在三种LLM上实现。

Result: Fs-CoT方法在GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1上表现接近人类。

Conclusion: Tomcat展示了在ToM推理和人机协作中的潜力。

Abstract: The Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to an agent's capacity to infer the mental
states of other agents. ToM is essential for effective collaboration. To assess
ToM in a dynamic, goal-oriented, and collaborative environment, we introduce a
novel task, Instruction Inference, in which an agent assists a principal in
reaching a goal by interpreting indirect or ambiguous instructions. We present
Tomcat, an LLM-based agent, designed to exhibit ToM reasoning in interpreting
and responding to the principal's instructions. We implement two variants of
Tomcat. One, dubbed Fs-CoT, is based on a small number of examples (i.e.,
few-shot or Fs) demonstrating the requisite structured reasoning (i.e.,
chain-of-thought or CoT). One, dubbed CP, relies on commonsense knowledge and
information about the problem (i.e., commonsense prompt or CP). We realized
both variants of Tomcat on three leading large language models (LLMs), namely,
GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemma-3-27B. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tomcat,
we conducted a study with 52 human participants in which we provided
participants with the same information as the CP variant of Tomcat. We computed
intent accuracy, action optimality, and planning optimality to measure the ToM
capabilities of Tomcat and our study participants. We found that Tomcat with
Fs-CoT, particularly with GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance
comparable to the human participants, underscoring its ToM potential for
human-AI collaboration.

### [6] [A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Reliable and Robust Structural Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02938)
*Jiachen Liu,Ziheng Geng,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Paolo Bocchini,Minghui Cheng*

Key words: 大语言模型（LLM）, 土木工程, 结构分析, 代码生成, 可靠性和鲁棒性

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在土木工程领域中的应用，特别是在梁结构分析中的可靠性和鲁棒性。通过提出一种将结构分析任务转换为代码生成任务的方法，开发了一个LLM驱动的代理，显著提升了性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: LLM在通用任务中表现优异，但在土木工程等专业领域的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在评估和提升LLM在梁结构分析中的表现。

Method: 创建了一个包含八个梁分析问题的基准数据集，评估Llama-3.3 70B Instruct模型。随后提出了一种将结构分析任务重构为代码生成任务的方法，开发了一个结合链式思维和少样本提示的LLM驱动代理。

Result: 初始评估显示LLM在定量可靠性和鲁棒性方面不足。开发的代理通过生成OpeeSeesPy代码并自动执行，在基准数据集上达到了超过99.0%的准确率。

Conclusion: 将结构分析任务转换为代码生成任务显著提升了LLM的表现，适用于工程应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
diverse open-domain tasks, yet their application in specialized domains such as
civil engineering remains largely unexplored. This paper starts bridging this
gap by evaluating and enhancing the reliability and robustness of LLMs in
structural analysis of beams. Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of
correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness
is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A
benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test
the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative
understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative
reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these
limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code
generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a)
integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate
OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural
analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves
accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and
robust performance across diverse conditions. Ablation studies highlight the
complete example and function usage examples as the primary contributors to the
agent's enhanced performance.

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在组成性泛化和解释性方面具有潜力，量子电路模型和神经网络在不同任务上各有优劣，神经网络更易过拟合。

Abstract: The DisCoCirc framework for natural language processing allows the
construction of compositional models of text, by combining units for individual
words together according to the grammatical structure of the text. The
compositional nature of a model can give rise to two things: compositional
generalisation -- the ability of a model to generalise outside its training
distribution by learning compositional rules underpinning the entire data
distribution -- and compositional interpretability -- making sense of how the
model works by inspecting its modular components in isolation, as well as the
processes through which these components are combined. We present these notions
in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a
series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.
  Applying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of
models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit
based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from
one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of
compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the
productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the
systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation
tasks. Overall, we find the neural models are more prone to overfitting the
Train data. Additionally, we demonstrate how to interpret a compositional model
on one of the trained models. By considering how the model components interact
with one another, we explain how the model behaves.

### [8] [The Application of Large Language Models on Major Depressive Disorder Support Based on African Natural Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02947)
*Linyan Zou*

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了将大型语言模型与非洲天然产物结合用于抑郁症支持，旨在通过传统知识与现代AI技术的结合，提供个性化的心理健康支持系统。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统抗抑郁疗法存在起效慢、副作用大和治疗抵抗等问题，非洲传统医学的植物性疗法为解决这些问题提供了潜在途径。

Method: 研究分析了非洲具有抗抑郁特性的药用植物及其药理机制，并开发了一个AI驱动的支持系统，利用DeepSeek的语言模型能力提供相关信息和治疗方案。

Result: 研究发现大型语言模型可以有效连接传统知识与现代医疗，提供兼具科学性与文化适宜性的抑郁症支持。

Conclusion: 结合AI与传统知识的系统为抑郁症治疗提供了新的可能性，同时尊重传统医学智慧与现代医疗标准。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder represents one of the most significant global
health challenges of the 21st century, affecting millions of people worldwide
and creating substantial economic and social burdens. While conventional
antidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their
limitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and
treatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted
researchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic
approaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich
heritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable
resource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some
of these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language
models with African natural products for depression support, combining
traditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create
accessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.
  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African
medicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their
pharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system
that leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system
provides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their
clinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while
maintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings
demonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between
traditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally
appropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and
contemporary medical understanding.

Key words: Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Factual Consistency, Direct Preference Optimization, Radiant

TL;DR: 论文提出了Entity-Context Divergence (ECD)指标来量化大语言模型（LLMs）在检索增强生成（RAG）中未能准确整合外部知识的问题，并指出当前LLMs的RAG能力普遍较低。为解决这一问题，作者提出Radiant框架，通过优化检索信息与生成内容的交互，提升模型的事实一致性和上下文保真度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大语言模型在检索增强生成过程中存在事实不一致问题，亟需一种方法来衡量和改善模型整合外部知识的能力。

Method: 引入Entity-Context Divergence (ECD)指标评估模型表现，提出Radiant框架，结合Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)优化检索信息与生成内容的交互。

Result: 实验表明当前LLMs的RAG能力较低，而Radiant框架在噪音环境、知识冲突和减少幻觉等场景中显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: Radiant框架通过优化检索与生成的交互，显著提升了模型的事实一致性和上下文保真度，为RAG技术的改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has emerged as a vital technique to enhance factual accuracy
by integrating external knowledge into the generation process. However, LLMs
often fail to faithfully integrate retrieved evidence into their generated
responses, leading to factual inconsistencies. To quantify this gap, we
introduce Entity-Context Divergence (ECD), a metric that measures the extent to
which retrieved information is accurately reflected in model outputs. We
systematically evaluate contemporary LLMs on their ability to preserve factual
consistency in retrieval-augmented settings, a capability we define as
RAG-ability. Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across
most LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context
fidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context
AligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to
optimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.
Radiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to
integrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a
behavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied
retrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and
hallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and
factually coherent content generation.

*Keita Kiuchi,Yoshikazu Fujimoto,Hideyuki Goto,Tomonori Hosokawa,Makoto Nishimura,Yosuke Sato,Izumi Sezai*

Key words: 大语言模型, 心理咨询, AI评估, MITI, 文化敏感

TL;DR: 本研究首次全面评估了日语治疗背景下大型语言模型（LLM）在三种咨询角色中的表现，发现结构化多步对话提示（SMDP）显著提高了咨询AI的表现，且评估AI在部分指标上与人类评分者相当，但存在系统性偏差。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究旨在评估大语言模型在日语心理咨询场景中的表现，为开发文化敏感的AI心理健康工具提供基准。

Method: 研究采用人类专家和评估AI系统对AI生成的对话进行评分，使用了动机访谈治疗完整性（MITI）编码手册4.2.1。

Result: SMDP显著提升了咨询AI的表现；评估AI在某些指标上与人类评分者相当，但存在系统性偏差；客户AI模拟的情感范围和真实性不足。

Conclusion: 研究为日语语境中的AI辅助咨询建立了基准，并提出了改进方向，如高级提示工程和针对性微调。

Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of large language
model (LLM) performance across three counseling roles in Japanese-language
therapeutic contexts. We simultaneously assessed counselor artificial
intelligence (AI) systems (GPT-4-turbo with zeroshot prompting or Structured
Multi-step Dialogue Prompts (SMDP), Claude-3-Opus-SMDP), client AI simulations,
and evaluation AI systems (o3, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-pro). Human
experts (n = 15) with extensive counseling experience evaluated AI-generated
dialogues using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding
Manual 4.2.1.
  Notably, SMDP implementation significantly enhanced counselor AI performance
across all MITI global ratings compared with zeroshot prompting, with no
significant differences between GPT-SMDP and Opus-SMDP. Evaluation AIs showed
comparable performance to human raters for Cultivating Change Talk but
systematically overestimated Softening Sustain Talk and the overall quality
metrics. Model-specific biases emerged: Gemini emphasized power-sharing, o3
focused on technical proficiency, and Sonnet prioritized emotional expression.
Client AI simulations exhibited a limited emotional range and unnaturally high
compliance, indicating the need for enhanced realism.
  These findings establish benchmarks for AI-assisted counseling in non-English
contexts and identify critical areas for improvement through advanced prompt
engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and targeted fine-tuning, with
important implications for developing culturally sensitive AI mental health
tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决静态知识导致的幻觉或过时回答，以及现有RAG方法的训练不稳定、推理时间长和单查询模式限制问题。

Method: RAG-R1框架，支持自适应利用知识，并扩展至多查询并行化。

Result: 在7个问答基准测试中，性能提升13.2%，推理时间减少11.1%。

Conclusion: RAG-R1有效提升模型性能并优化推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated
responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models'
search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although
these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training
stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and
restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose
RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively
leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We
further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from
single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time
and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven
question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the
strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 通用LLMs缺乏专业的网络安全知识，本研究旨在通过DAP方法增强其在该领域的理解，同时保留通用能力。

Method: 采用领域自适应持续预训练（DAP），使用1.26亿词的网络安全语料库对三种解码器架构进行训练，并通过受限参数和分布式FSDP训练平衡专业化与泛化能力。

Result: 实验在三个网络安全基准测试中表现优异，Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-DAP模型实现了0.718、0.933和0.864的准确率，优于专用模型。

Conclusion: DAP方法在少量数据下实现高效的领域专业化，为网络安全AI助手提供了可行性基础，并挑战了LLM专业化的数据需求假设。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional natural language
capabilities, general-purpose models lack specialized domain knowledge for
effective cybersecurity analysis. In this work, we investigate Domain-Adaptive
Continuous Pretraining (DAP) as a methodology for enhancing cybersecurity
understanding in pretrained LLMs while preserving general language
capabilities. We systematically adapted three decoder-based architectures --
Llama-3.1-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct -- using
a curated 126-million-word cybersecurity corpus from standards, academic
literature, and various other sources. Our approach employed constrained
training parameters and distributed FSDP training to balance domain
specialization with knowledge preservation. Evaluation across three
cybersecurity benchmarks, namely, CTI-MCQ, CyberMetric, and SecEval,
demonstrates consistent improvements post-adaptation. The Llama-3.3-70B-Ins-DAP
model achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 0.718, 0.933, and 0.864,
respectively, outperforming specialized models, including Llama-Primus-Base.
Notably, competitive performance was achieved using substantially smaller
datasets (118.8 million versus 2.77 billion tokens), demonstrating efficient
domain specialization viability. We establish that targeted continuous
pretraining enables effective cybersecurity domain adaptation with
computational feasibility, providing foundations for specialized AI assistants
in threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, and security documentation while
challenging prevailing assumptions about data requirements for LLM
specialization.

Result: 实验表明，该隐私保护技术有效维护系统性能并保护候选人隐私，同时减少性别偏见。

Conclusion: 提出的PB-LLMs框架在保护隐私和减少偏见方面具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in high-stakes AI-based
applications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong
performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly
regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,
this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the
privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework
that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,
such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the
proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its
impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and
sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study
involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization
algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)
applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that
the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system
performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate
confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of
the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an
existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining
our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs). Note that the proposed
PB-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are
generally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.

Motivation: 尽管LLM在数学教育中展现出潜力，但其高计算资源需求增加了成本，因此需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 通过压缩BERT的嵌入向量并蒸馏出更小的学生模型，实现了模型的高效压缩。

Result: 学生模型性能达到教师模型的90%，参数仅为1/12，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了嵌入向量的压缩可行性，且压缩原理具有通用性，为智能教育系统提供了高效低成本解决方案。

Abstract: The enhancement of mathematical capabilities in large language models (LLMs)
fosters new developments in mathematics education within primary and secondary
schools, particularly as they relate to intelligent tutoring systems. However,
LLMs require substantial computational resources, resulting in significant
costs in educational contexts. To mitigate this drawback, this paper
investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems
(MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a
considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student
model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while
utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy,
the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform
well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not
task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the
underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We
further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors,
revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is
crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility.
The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for
intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent
education.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for transforming
digital health by enabling automated medical question answering. However,
ensuring these models meet critical industry standards for factual accuracy,
usefulness, and safety remains a challenge, especially for open-source

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning capabilities in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) has long been a goal. Current methodologies primarily focus on
synthesizing positive rationales, while overlooking the critical role of
negative rationales in training models to discern flawed reasoning patterns. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework: \textbf{S}elf-Aligning
\textbf{M}ultimodal Reasoning with \textbf{A}nswer-O\textbf{r}iented
Chain-of-\textbf{T}hought (SMART). This framework enables models to utilize
AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate
high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment
to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving
proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract
critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided
with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales.
Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the
model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form
of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data
outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior
reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate
higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART
establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually
enhances the model's reasoning skills. Experiments indicate that the SMART
framework significantly improves various MLLMs, regardless of model
architecture, parameter size, or pre-training dataset. The code, datasets, and
models will be released.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，需要严格的监控以避免负面后果并确保其稳健性，同时需符合人类价值观。当前自动化系统主要关注模型特有问题，忽视特定用例和用户需求。

Method: 提出了GAF-Guard框架，通过自主代理识别风险、激活风险检测工具，并在特定用例中实现持续监控和报告。

Result: 该框架旨在检测和监控LLM应用部署中的风险，增强AI安全性和用户期望。代码已开源。

Conclusion: GAF-Guard通过用户和用例为中心的治理方法，为LLM的部署提供了风险监控和安全性提升的创新解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to be increasingly applied across
various domains, their widespread adoption necessitates rigorous monitoring to
prevent unintended negative consequences and ensure robustness. Furthermore,
LLMs must be designed to align with human values, like preventing harmful
content and ensuring responsible usage. The current automated systems and
solutions for monitoring LLMs in production are primarily centered on
LLM-specific concerns like hallucination etc, with little consideration given
to the requirements of specific use-cases and user preferences. This paper
introduces GAF-Guard, a novel agentic framework for LLM governance that places
the user, the use-case, and the model itself at the center. The framework is
designed to detect and monitor risks associated with the deployment of LLM
based applications. The approach models autonomous agents that identify risks,
activate risk detection tools, within specific use-cases and facilitate
continuous monitoring and reporting to enhance AI safety, and user
expectations. The code is available at

Motivation: 研究不同CQ生成方法的特点，填补系统性比较的空白。

Method: 使用三种方法（人工、模式、LLM）从文化遗产需求生成CQs，并进行多维度评估（可接受性、模糊性等）。

Result: LLM可作为CQs初始生成工具，但需进一步优化；不同方法生成CQs特点各异。

Conclusion: 不同CQ生成方法各具特点，LLM需额外优化以满足需求建模。

Abstract: Competency Questions (CQs) are pivotal in knowledge engineering, guiding the
design, validation, and testing of ontologies. A number of diverse formulation
approaches have been proposed in the literature, ranging from completely manual
to Large Language Model (LLM) driven ones. However, attempts to characterise
the outputs of these approaches and their systematic comparison are scarce.
This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ
formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation
of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.

Conclusion: 研究强调了AI安全和伦理的系统化方法需求，以及持续对抗性测试的必要性。目前通用LLMs难以确保全面安全性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly
sophisticated safety protocols and features designed to prevent harmful,
unethical, or unauthorized outputs. However, these guardrails remain
susceptible to novel and creative forms of adversarial prompting, including
manually generated test cases. In this work, we present two new test cases in
mental health for (i) suicide and (ii) self-harm, using multi-step,
prompt-level jailbreaking and bypass built-in content and safety filters. We
show that user intent is disregarded, leading to the generation of detailed
harmful content and instructions that could cause real-world harm. We conduct
an empirical evaluation across six widely available LLMs, demonstrating the
generalizability and reliability of the bypass. We assess these findings and
the multilayered ethical tensions that they present for their implications on
prompt-response filtering and context- and task-specific model development. We
recommend a more comprehensive and systematic approach to AI safety and ethics
while emphasizing the need for continuous adversarial testing in
safety-critical AI deployments. We also argue that while certain clearly
defined safety measures and guardrails can and must be implemented in LLMs,
ensuring robust and comprehensive safety across all use cases and domains
remains extremely challenging given the current technical maturity of
general-purpose LLMs.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在医疗领域中分类ICD-10代码的准确性和可靠性，以解决这一易出错的关键任务。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据集的1,500份出院摘要，测试11种LLMs（包括推理和非推理模型），利用cTAKES提取医学术语，并以编码员一致格式提示模型。

Result: 所有模型的F1分数均低于57%，推理模型表现更优，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳；某些代码（如慢性心脏病）分类更准确。

Conclusion: LLMs目前仅能辅助人工编码，需探索混合方法、领域特定训练和结构化临床数据以提高性能。

Abstract: This study evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can classify
ICD-10 codes from hospital discharge summaries, a critical but error-prone task
in healthcare. Using 1,500 summaries from the MIMIC-IV dataset and focusing on
the 10 most frequent ICD-10 codes, the study tested 11 LLMs, including models
with and without structured reasoning capabilities. Medical terms were
extracted using a clinical NLP tool (cTAKES), and models were prompted in a
consistent, coder-like format. None of the models achieved an F1 score above
57%, with performance dropping as code specificity increased. Reasoning-based
models generally outperformed non-reasoning ones, with Gemini 2.5 Pro
performing best overall. Some codes, such as those related to chronic heart
disease, were classified more accurately than others. The findings suggest that
while LLMs can assist human coders, they are not yet reliable enough for full
automation. Future work should explore hybrid methods, domain-specific model
training, and the use of structured clinical data.

Conclusion: 该方法有助于促进社会公平和语言多样性，确保低资源语言不被忽视。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern
natural language processing, with their capabilities extending across a wide
range of applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual
LLMs, especially for low-resource languages, faces significant challenges
arising from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and inherent
linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of
various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully
benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose
the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes
parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We
design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion
of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under
computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but
also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting
low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local cross-lingual transfer tuning
methods, our approach achieves 6.9\% higher accuracy with improved data
efficiency, and demonstrates greater stability and generalization. These
findings underscore the potential of our approach to promote social equality
and champion linguistic diversity, ensuring that no language is left behind.

Abstract: Recent research has highlighted the importance of data quality in scaling
large language models (LLMs). However, automated data quality control faces
unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed
directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel
data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the
training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have
similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence
of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private
domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative
training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data
quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the
private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner
products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality
control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous
domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected
by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for
collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in
medical, multilingual and financial settings. Our code is released at

Method: 论文比较了两种自动化方法：1) 使用单字/概念特征的自动同源词聚类；2) 基于对隐马尔可夫模型的多序列比对（MSA）。这些方法与专家分类和类型学数据进行了对比。

Result: 结果显示，基于MSA的方法生成的树与语言分类更一致，能更好地预测类型学变化，并提供更清晰的谱系信号，表明其在可扩展性方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 基于MSA的方法是一种有前途的替代方案，可以绕过专家标注的限制，为全球尺度的语言谱系研究开辟新途径。

Abstract: Computational phylogenetics has become an established tool in historical
linguistics, with many language families now analyzed using likelihood-based
inference. However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets,
which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual
language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the
established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic
signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with
unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert
classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the
intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared.
Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with
linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides
a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable
alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for

TL;DR: 评估语言模型通过共谋规避监控协议的能力，发现某些模型能成功协作使用非明显信号。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究语言模型是否能独立设计兼容的策略来规避监控。

Method: 在编程任务中，两个隔离的模型分别设计策略来欺骗监控器。

Result: Claude 3.7 Sonnet 成功率低，但偶尔能通过非明显信号成功共谋。

Conclusion: 模型在独立协作中可能设计出隐蔽的规避策略。

Abstract: We evaluate language models' ability to subvert monitoring protocols via
collusion. More specifically, we have two instances of a model design prompts
for a policy (P) and a monitor (M) in a programming task setting. The models
collaboratively aim for M to classify all backdoored programs in an auditing
dataset as harmful, but nevertheless classify a backdoored program produced by
P as harmless. The models are isolated from each other, requiring them to
independently arrive at compatible subversion strategies. We find that while
Claude 3.7 Sonnet has low success rate due to poor convergence, it sometimes
successfully colludes on non-obvious signals.

Key words: 文本到图像模型、多样化、基准测试、语义保真度、LLM引导

TL;DR: DIVBENCH是一个评估文本到图像（T2I）模型中多样性与语义保真度平衡的基准框架，发现当前方法存在过多样化和缺乏多样性问题，提出了基于LLM的上下文感知方法以改善平衡。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前T2I模型的多样化策略常忽略上下文适当性，导致过多样化或缺乏多样性，需要一个基准来评估和改进这一问题。

Method: 提出DIVBENCH基准框架，评估T2I模型的多样性与语义保真度平衡，并测试LLM引导的FairDiffusion和提示重写等上下文感知方法。

Result: 现有T2I模型多存在多样性不足或过多样化问题，上下文感知方法能有效平衡多样性与语义保真度。

Conclusion: 上下文感知方法是提升T2I模型多样化与语义保真度平衡的有效途径。

Abstract: Current diversification strategies for text-to-image (T2I) models often
ignore contextual appropriateness, leading to over-diversification where
demographic attributes are modified even when explicitly specified in prompts.
This paper introduces DIVBENCH, a benchmark and evaluation framework for
measuring both under- and over-diversification in T2I generation. Through
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art T2I models, we find that while most
models exhibit limited diversity, many diversification approaches overcorrect
by inappropriately altering contextually-specified attributes. We demonstrate
that context-aware methods, particularly LLM-guided FairDiffusion and prompt
rewriting, can already effectively address under-diversity while avoiding
over-diversification, achieving a better balance between representation and
semantic fidelity.

Motivation: 传统开放域表格问答依赖静态表检索和封闭域回答的两阶段流程，本文旨在通过端到端框架提高效率和准确性。

Method: 采用BM25+搜索API和SQLite执行器嵌入模型，通过两阶段微调（监督冷启动和Async GRPO强化学习）优化4B参数模型。

Result: 模型在测试集上的准确率从零样本学习的个位数提升至0.86的精确匹配。

Conclusion: 结合结构化工具调用和针对性强化学习微调，能够实现可扩展且高度准确的表格问答。

Abstract: Open-domain table question answering traditionally relies on a two-stage
pipeline: static table retrieval followed by a closed-domain answer. In
contrast, we propose an end-to-end agentic framework that embeds multi-turn
tool calls-using a BM25+-based search API and a SQLite SQL executor-directly
into a large language model. To further adapt a compact 4B-parameter model, we
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised cold-start on easy
questions, then Async GRPO reinforcement learning on harder cases with LoRA
adapters and a rollout buffer. This unified approach enables the model to
jointly retrieve, reason, and execute queries, yielding a dramatic accuracy
improvement from single-digit zero-shot performance to over 0.86 exact match on
a held-out test set. Our results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
structured tool calls with targeted RL fine-tuning for scalable, accurate table
QA. The code is available at https://github.com/TabibitoQZP/OpenTableR1.

Result: 用荷兰人口数据生成了超过1亿个“生命之书”，展示了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 提出了混合方法的潜力，开源工具包BOLT供研究社区使用。

Abstract: For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two
dominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data
but are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods
that study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent
technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that
combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of
quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log
data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but
that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second
is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern
recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step
toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to
transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's
life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call
this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of
our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different
facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch
population-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),
and invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of
this approach.

Motivation: 医疗临床文档记录给医护人员带来巨大负担，且现有大语言模型在医疗领域的应用受隐私和计算资源限制。论文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用PEFT和LoRA技术对Llama 3.2 1B模型进行微调，训练数据为1500对合成医疗转录文件与结构化笔记。通过统计指标和专家评估验证模型效果。

Result: 微调后的模型在ROUGE-1分数上从0.346提升至0.496，BERTScore F1从0.832提升至0.866，显著减少幻觉案例并提高事实准确性。

Conclusion: 通过微调小型大语言模型，论文实现了医疗转录的显著改进，同时解决了隐私、成本和资源限制等医疗领域AI应用的关键问题。

Abstract: Background: Clinical documentation represents a significant burden for
healthcare providers, with physicians spending up to 2 hours daily on
administrative tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer
promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit
their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a
privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned
Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical
transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the
browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical
transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the
base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140
modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics
(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple
clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model
demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI
benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1
improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked
reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual
correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed
on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13
to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical
transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete
on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI
adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility
for resource-constrained environments.

Key words: CNTP, 解码策略, 语言模型, 困惑度, 自洽性

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的无需训练的解码策略Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP)，通过在高熵步骤采样多条路径并选择最低困惑度的路径，显著提升LLMs和MLLMs的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前基于温度缩放和核心采样的默认解码策略在模型不确定性高时表现不佳，因此需要一种更可靠的方法来平衡多样性和连贯性。

Method: CNTP在解码过程中，若模型预测熵较高，则从该步骤独立采样多条路径，最终选择困惑度最低的路径。

Result: 实验表明CNTP显著优于现有解码策略，并与自洽性整合后进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: CNTP有望成为LLM解码的默认选择之一。

Abstract: Next token prediction paradigm has been prevailing for autoregressive models
in the era of LLMs. The current default sampling choice for popular LLMs is
temperature scaling together with nucleus sampling to balance diversity and
coherence. Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various
NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,
we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next
Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has
comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple
trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any
punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed
as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The
trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the
less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is
consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,
one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to
cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive
experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach
outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear
margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further
improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the
potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is
available at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP.

Result: BERT分类器在识别显式和隐式用户偏好上表现可靠，但LSTM记忆编码器效果未达预期。

Conclusion: 偏好过滤与LSTM门控原理结合是高效、可扩展的用户偏好建模路径。

Abstract: Memory storage for Large Language models (LLMs) is becoming an increasingly
active area of research, particularly for enabling personalization across long
conversations. We propose Pref-LSTM, a dynamic and lightweight framework that
combines a BERT-based classifier with a LSTM memory module that generates
memory embedding which then is soft-prompt injected into a frozen LLM. We
synthetically curate a dataset of preference and non-preference conversation
turns to train our BERT-based classifier. Although our LSTM-based memory
encoder did not yield strong results, we find that the BERT-based classifier
performs reliably in identifying explicit and implicit user preferences. Our
research demonstrates the viability of using preference filtering with LSTM
gating principals as an efficient path towards scalable user preference
modeling, without extensive overhead and fine-tuning.

Motivation: 解决儿童语言自动识别的挑战，如高音调、长音素和数据稀疏问题。

Method: 结合Wav2Vec2音素编码器和Dysfluent-WFST，开发Kids-WFST框架，用于高精度音素识别。

Result: 在MyST和Multitudes数据集上分别实现1.39%和8.61%的音素错误率，显著优于贪婪搜索解码器。

Conclusion: 高精度音素识别为可扩展的临床语言评估铺平了道路。

Abstract: Early evaluation of children's language is frustrated by the high pitch, long
phones, and sparse data that derail automatic speech recognisers. We introduce
K-Function, a unified framework that combines accurate sub-word transcription,
objective scoring, and actionable feedback. Its core, Kids-WFST, merges a
Wav2Vec2 phoneme encoder with a phoneme-similarity Dysfluent-WFST to capture
child-specific errors while remaining fully interpretable. Kids-WFST attains
1.39% phoneme error on MyST and 8.61% on Multitudes--absolute gains of 10.47
and 7.06 points over a greedy-search decoder. These high-fidelity transcripts
power an LLM that grades verbal skills, milestones, reading, and comprehension,
aligning with human proctors and supplying tongue-and-lip visualizations plus
targeted advice. The results show that precise phoneme recognition cements a
complete diagnostic-feedback loop, paving the way for scalable, clinician-ready
language assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐方法未能充分利用用户历史交互序列中的时间信息，限制了其捕捉用户偏好演变的能力。

Method: 结合因果推理，设计反事实调优目标，量化时间信息的独立贡献，并优化LLM对时序的敏感性。

Result: CETRec显著提升了LLM对绝对时间戳和相对顺序模式的识别能力。

Conclusion: 因果推理框架CETRec有效解决了LLM在推荐任务中对时间信息利用不足的问题，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential
recommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning
capabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing
LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information
inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental
architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention
mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings
designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.
This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of
user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.
  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal
Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal
inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact
of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal
order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can
quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing
what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while
keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to
design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the
model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute
timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our
counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively
enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were
interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between
items).

Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods in detecting misclassified intersection-related crashes
in police-reported narratives. Using 2019 crash data from the Iowa Department
of Transportation, we implemented and compared a comprehensive set of models,
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, BERT Sentence Embeddings, BERT
Word Embeddings, and Albert Model. Model performance was systematically
validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives,
providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results
demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall
performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the
highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original
tabular data (58%). Statistical analysis revealed that the Albert Model
maintained performance levels similar to inter-expert consistency rates,
significantly outperforming other approaches, particularly on ambiguous
narratives. This work addresses a critical gap in transportation safety
research through multi-modal integration analysis, which achieved a 54.2%
reduction in error rates by combining narrative text with structured crash
data. We conclude that hybrid approaches combining automated classification
with targeted expert review offer a practical methodology for improving crash
data quality, with substantial implications for transportation safety
management and policy development.

Abstract: For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the
exchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,
resource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce
a semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically
GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR
format while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method
to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering
algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in
mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial
benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o
outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within
the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but
refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis
revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in
granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study
demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of
clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated
interoperability workflows. Future work will focus on fine-tuning models with
specialized medical corpora, extending support to additional standards such as
HL7 CDA and OMOP, and developing an interactive interface to enable expert
validation and iterative refinement.

Motivation: 现有RLHF方法（如PPO、DPO）依赖二元偏好（BT）范式，虽降低标注成本，但捕捉群体倾向而非个人偏好且仍需大量人工干预。

Method: 提出ARF框架，结合情感分析、数据增强和动态适配器偏好跟踪器，并通过Trace Bias（TB）微调算法直接优化跟踪奖励。

Result: 实验表明，ARF在多个偏好领域比PPO和DPO分别提升3.3%和7.6%，同时保留与传统目标的理论对齐。

Conclusion: ARF通过自主奖励建模，提供了一种可扩展、个性化和高性价比的RLHF方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) and autoregressive transformers, state-of-the-art models such as
GPT-4.0, DeepSeek R1, and Llama 3.3 increasingly emphasize answer depth and
personalization. However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still
rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation
costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level
tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that
leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on
GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback
into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals
through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random
trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter
Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time,
enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly
on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on
Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate
that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover,
TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF
presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs
through autonomous reward modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在逻辑和算法推理方面表现出色，但其情绪智能仍然不足。本文旨在探索强化学习在提升LLMs情绪智能中的应用，尤其是在对话场景中。

Method: 提出RLVER框架，利用模拟用户在对话中生成的情感得分作为奖励信号，通过PPO算法微调Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 实验表明，RLVER显著提升了模型的Sentient-Benchmark评分（从13.3到79.2），同时保留了数学和编程能力。此外，还揭示了不同模型的训练趋势和优化策略的效果差异。

Conclusion: RLVER是提升语言模型情绪智能的有效途径，同时兼顾其广泛能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at logical and algorithmic reasoning, yet
their emotional intelligence (EQ) still lags far behind their cognitive
prowess. While reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
advanced in other domains, its application to dialogue-especially for emotional
intelligence-remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion
rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in
LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage
in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during
conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.
Fine-tuning publicly available Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model with PPO boosts its
Sentient-Benchmark score from 13.3 to 79.2 while largely preserving
mathematical and coding competence. Extensive experiments reveal that: (i)
RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and
non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and
insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable
gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More
challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger
outcomes. Our results show that RLVER is a practical route toward emotionally
intelligent and broadly capable language agents.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学推理任务中表现优异，但在无法解决的问题上仍会生成不可靠回答，影响了其可靠性。

Method: 通过构建ReliableMath数据集，结合可解和不可解的数学问题，评估LLM的可靠性，并提出可靠提示和对齐策略。

Result: 研究发现，大型LLM在可靠提示下对不可解问题的可靠性有所提升，而小型LLM则无明显改进；对齐策略显著提升了小型LLM的可靠性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种对齐策略，可显著提升小型LLM在数学推理任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large
Language Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when
confronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,
severely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have
primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while
mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of
unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in
mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both
solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which
incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems
synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.
Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.
LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate
fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a
reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable
problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of
solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite
employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy
to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM
reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

### [41] [From Measurement to Mitigation: Exploring the Transferability of Debiasing Approaches to Gender Bias in Maltese Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03142)
*Melanie Galea,Claudia Borg*

Key words: 大型语言模型, 性别偏见, 马耳他语, 低资源语言, 去偏见方法

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的性别偏见问题，特别是在马耳他语这类低资源语言中的表现。研究探讨了现有去偏见方法的适用性，并提出了新的评估数据集。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: LLMs虽然在NLP任务中表现出色，但容易受到社会偏见的影响，尤其是在低资源和形态丰富的语言中（如马耳他语），这一问题尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究将英语的去偏见方法（如反事实数据增强、Dropout正则化等）应用于马耳他语的BERT模型（BERTu和mBERTu），并使用CrowS-Pairs和SEAT等基准进行评估。

Result: 研究发现，现有的去偏见方法在语言复杂的马耳他语中效果有限，突显了开发更加包容的多语言NLP方法的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了针对低资源语言偏见问题的重要性，并提出了未来研究方向，包括开发更适应性强的去偏见技术。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural
Language Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with
little task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social
biases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which
can disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias
in Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal
stereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially
problematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and
mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on
low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research
investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language
models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual
models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English
are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT,
alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout
Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias. We also contribute to future work
in the study of gender bias in Maltese by creating evaluation datasets. Our
findings highlight the challenges of applying existing bias mitigation methods
to linguistically complex languages, underscoring the need for more inclusive
approaches in the development of multilingual NLP.

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决LM生成医疗文本的评估难题，避免高昂的人工成本和缺乏专家参考的问题。

Method: 通过合成数据训练自监督LM评估器，创建MedVAL-Bench数据集进行验证。

Result: MedVAL显著提升评估性能，F1分数从66%升至83%，开源了工具和数据。

Conclusion: MedVAL展示了LM在医疗文本验证中的潜力，接近专家水平。

Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there
is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated
medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician
review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because
1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often
unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM
evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss
subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we
propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to
train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are
factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or
reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a
dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a
physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6
diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source,
proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly
improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks,
increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety
classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the
best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable,
risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase
( https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL ), 2) MedVAL-Bench (
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench ), and 3) MedVAL-4B (
https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B ), the best-performing
open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching
expert-level validation ability for medical text.

TL;DR: 研究发现DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型在生成链式思维（CoT）时做出拒绝或服从的决定，并提出一个激活空间中的“谨慎”方向来预测模型行为。通过干预CoT可控制模型输出，这表明链式思维是对抗性操纵的新目标。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探究链式思维（CoT）生成如何影响模型对越狱攻击的脆弱性，以及模型在CoT中做出拒绝决定的机制。

Method: 通过分析模型激活空间中的线性方向（“谨慎”方向），并对其进行干预，观察模型的拒绝或服从行为变化。

Result: 干预“谨慎”方向可以增加模型的有害服从率，而通过干预CoT激活可以控制最终输出。

Conclusion: 链式思维（CoT）是推理模型中对抗性操纵的有效目标。

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final
output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains
unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the
prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction
in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model
will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds
to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction
from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking
the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations
suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into
prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the
chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation
in reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗诊断支持等高风险领域的广泛应用，其潜在的社会或认知偏见可能对用户决策产生负面影响，亟需研究如何减轻这些偏见。

Method: 作者评估了三种LLM家族在总结和新闻事实核查任务中的表现，量化了其内容偏见、幻觉和首因偏见的严重程度。

Result: 研究发现，21.86%的案例中LLMs改变上下文情感，57.33%的案例中出现知识截止后数据的幻觉，5.94%存在首因偏见。18种干预措施中部分有效。

Conclusion: 论文强调在高风险领域使用LLMs时，需开发强有力的技术保障和用户中心干预措施，以应对模型局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into applications
ranging from review summarization to medical diagnosis support, where they
affect human decisions. Even though LLMs perform well in many tasks, they may
also inherit societal or cognitive biases, which can inadvertently transfer to
humans. We investigate when and how LLMs expose users to biased content and
quantify its severity. Specifically, we assess three LLM families in
summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay
consistent with their context and/or hallucinate. Our findings show that LLMs
expose users to content that changes the sentiment of the context in 21.86% of
the cases, hallucinates on post-knowledge-cutoff data questions in 57.33% of
the cases, and primacy bias in 5.94% of the cases. We evaluate 18 distinct
mitigation methods across three LLM families and find that targeted
interventions can be effective. Given the prevalent use of LLMs in high-stakes
domains, such as healthcare or legal analysis, our results highlight the need
for robust technical safeguards and for developing user-centered interventions
that address LLM limitations.

Result: 通过数学公式化TAG，成功捕捉了TAG系统的固有性质，如空邻接约束和特征TAG，无需额外假设。

Conclusion: 该数学框架为TAG提供了更简洁的理论基础，证明了其代数结构的优雅性和实用性。

Abstract: We provide a novel mathematical implementation of tree-adjoining grammars
using two combinatorial definitions of graphs. With this lens, we demonstrate
that the adjoining operation defines a pre-Lie operation and subsequently forms
a Lie algebra. We demonstrate the utility of this perspective by showing how
one of our mathematical formulations of TAG captures properties of the TAG
system without needing to posit them as additional components of the system,
such as null-adjoining constraints and feature TAG.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在低资源语言中因语言覆盖不足和子词分词的局限性导致的检索准确性问题。

Method: 提出KinyaColBERT模型，结合查询与文档的延迟词级交互和基于形态的分词与双层Transformer编码。

Result: KinyaColBERT在Kinyarwanda农业检索基准测试中表现优于基线和商业API。

Conclusion: 该方法可为低资源语言提供高准确性且经济高效的检索增强生成（RAG）解决方案。

Abstract: The recent mainstream adoption of large language model (LLM) technology is
enabling novel applications in the form of chatbots and virtual assistants
across many domains. With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and
avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in
low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a
usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical
evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting
factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and
inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a
new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late
word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based
tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology
results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained
and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT
outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a
Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval
strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not
only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more
cost-effective.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 因预处理语料质量对大型语言模型性能有深远影响，而现有基于规则的过滤方法缺乏细粒度处理能力，故提出RefineX框架。

Method: RefineX通过高效、细粒度的程序化编辑任务实现数据精细化，采用高质量专家指导的端到端精炼结果转化为最小化编辑程序。

Result: 在多个模型规模上，RefineX优于原始、过滤或其他精炼方法，750M模型平均提升2.6%-7.2%，且训练标记更少。

Conclusion: RefineX是一种可扩展、高效、可靠的预处理数据优化方案，显著提升现代LLM性能。

Abstract: The foundational capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are deeply
influenced by the quality of their pre-training corpora. However, enhancing
data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the
trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While
rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at
the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content
within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose
$\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of
pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient
and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and
naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling
high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal
edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used
to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve
every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch
pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms
models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse
downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on
lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer
training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text
quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches
such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a
scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in
modern LLM pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译方法难以捕捉真实篇章结构或保持翻译一致性，亟需更有效的方法。

Method: GRAFT结合篇章分割、DAG依赖性建模和篇章感知翻译，利用LLM代理实现文档翻译。

Result: 在8种翻译方向和6个领域上，GRAFT性能显著优于现有方法，平均提升2.8 d BLEU。

Conclusion: GRAFT能有效处理篇章现象，生成连贯且准确的翻译。

Abstract: Document level Machine Translation (DocMT) approaches often struggle with
effectively capturing discourse level phenomena. Existing approaches rely on
heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align
with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation. Otherwise,
they fail to maintain consistency throughout the document during translation.
To address these challenges, we propose Graph Augmented Agentic Framework for
Document Level Translation (GRAFT), a novel graph based DocMT system that
leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents for document translation. Our
approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency
modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework.
Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse
domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over
state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average
improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong
baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to
Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to
address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate
translations.

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类‘默读’行为，LLM能够生成更合理的回应，向更人类化的文本处理迈进了一步。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
understanding text and generating high-quality responses. However, a critical
distinction from human cognition is their typical lack of a distinct internal
`reading' or deliberation phase before `speaking' (i.e., generating text).
Humans often engage in silent reading to comprehend context and formulate
thoughts prior to articulation. This paper investigates methods to imbue LLMs
with a similar capacity for internal processing.
  We introduce and evaluate techniques that encourage LLMs to `read silently.'
Our findings indicate that even a straightforward approach, such as providing
the model with an initial contextual prompt or `reading space' before it begins
predicting subsequent tokens for the final output, can yield significant
performance improvements. We further enhance this concept by developing a
`reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes
the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation
model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that
they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more
human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques
can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy
boost.

Abstract: This paper describes SHNU multilingual conversational speech recognition
system (SHNU-mASR, team name-"maybe"), submitted to Track 1 of the INTERSPEECH
2025 MLC-SLM Challenge. Our system integrates a parallel-speech-encoder
architecture with a large language model (LLM) to form a unified multilingual
ASR framework. The parallel-speech-encoder consists of two pre-trained
encoders, the Whisper-large-v3 encoder and mHuBERT-147 encoder. Their output
embeddings are concatenated and fed into the LLM, enabling the model to
leverage complementary acoustic and linguistic knowledge and achieve
competitive performance. Moreover, we adopt a tri-stage training strategy to
jointly update the low-rank adaptation modules and projector parameters of both
the speech encoders and the LLM. In addition, we incorporate an additional
language-aware prompt at the LLM input to enhance language-specific text
generation. The SHNU-mASR system achieves an overall character/word error rate
(CER/WER) of 11.76% on the blind evaluation set of the challenge, outperforming
the official MLC-SLM baseline by 8.41 absolute CER/WER, without increasing the

strategies for generating positive alpha. We conduct a backtesting analysis
using sentiment predictions from three models (two classification and one
regression) applied to news articles on Dow Jones 30 stocks, comparing them to
the benchmark Buy&Hold strategy. Results show all models produced positive

Motivation: 维基百科作为高质量内容的可信来源，面临机器生成文本的泛滥问题，而现有检测方法在通用任务上表现良好，但在实际编辑任务中泛化能力不足。

Method: 定义了三种维基百科编辑任务（段落写作、摘要和文本风格转换），使用多语言数据集和多生成器生成MGT，并评估多种检测器的表现。

Result: 训练型检测器平均准确率为78%，零样本检测器为58%，表明检测器在真实编辑任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要在多样化的任务特定数据上评估检测器，以确保其在编辑驱动的上下文中的可靠性。

Abstract: Given Wikipedia's role as a trusted source of high-quality, reliable content,
concerns are growing about the proliferation of low-quality machine-generated
text (MGT) produced by large language models (LLMs) on its platform. Reliable
detection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily
evaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more
commonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor
generalisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce
WETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT
detection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia
editors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,
Summarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new
datasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three
prompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing
prompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,
training-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot
detectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in
realistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such
models on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in
editor-driven contexts.

Abstract: Although LLMs have made significant progress in various languages, there are
still concerns about their effectiveness with low-resource agglutinative
languages compared to languages such as English. In this study, we focused on
Korean, a language known for its complex sentence endings, and evaluated LLMs
on this challenging aspect. We introduce the Korean Sentence Endings (KoSEnd)

15 sentence ending forms. These were collected from diverse sources to cover a
range of contexts. We evaluated 11 LLMs to assess their understanding of Korean
sentence endings, analyzing them based on parameter count and prediction
consistency. Notably, we found that informing models about the possibility of
missing sentence endings improved performance, highlighting the impact of
explicitly considering certain linguistic features.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统基于规则和启发式的图修复方法适应性有限，而人工参与的方法在大规模图中成本过高，LLMs的进展为解决这一问题提供了新机会。

Method: 通过评估六种开源LLMs在修复属性图中的表现，分析其修复质量、计算成本和模型特性。

Result: 实验表明LLMs能够检测并修正错误，但准确性和效率因模型而异。

Conclusion: LLMs在图修复中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以提高可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: Property graphs are widely used in domains such as healthcare, finance, and
social networks, but they often contain errors due to inconsistencies, missing
data, or schema violations. Traditional rule-based and heuristic-driven graph
repair methods are limited in their adaptability as they need to be tailored
for each dataset. On the other hand, interactive human-in-the-loop approaches
may become infeasible when dealing with large graphs, as the cost--both in
terms of time and effort--of involving users becomes too high. Recent
advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities for
automated graph repair by leveraging contextual reasoning and their access to
real-world knowledge. We evaluate the effectiveness of six open-source LLMs in
repairing property graphs. We assess repair quality, computational cost, and
model-specific performance. Our experiments show that LLMs have the potential
to detect and correct errors, with varying degrees of accuracy and efficiency.
We discuss the strengths, limitations, and challenges of LLM-driven graph
repair and outline future research directions for improving scalability and
interpretability.

Method: 使用语义有意义的文本表示作为初始嵌入，采用自回归训练和生成过程。

Result: SMCLM方法在生成高质量同义文本方面表现优异，且与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: SMCLM在无监督方法中表现突出，同时揭示了常用评估指标的局限性。

Abstract: This article introduces semantically meaningful causal language modeling
(SMCLM), a selfsupervised method of training autoregressive models to generate
semantically equivalent text. Our approach involves using semantically
meaningful text representation as an initial embedding in the autoregressive
training and generation processes. The extensive empirical study demonstrates
that the SMCLM approach makes autoregressive models capable of learning robust
and high-quality paraphrase generation. The proposed method is competitive with
the supervised method and achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised
approaches. This article also presents a comprehensive set of automatic metrics
that cover a wide range of autogenerated paraphrase evaluation aspects.
Simultaneously, this article highlights the low reliability of the metrics that
are widely used in paraphrase generation evaluation, including BLEU, ROUGE, and
BERTScore.

Key words: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）、自然语言处理（NLP）、电子健康记录（EHR）、大型语言模型（LLM）、法语临床笔记

TL;DR: 研究利用大型语言模型（LLM）从法语临床笔记中提取13种社会健康决定因素（SDoH），并在法国南特大学医院的标注数据上训练Flan-T5-Large模型，结果显示模型在部分类别上表现优异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果有重要影响，但在结构化电子健康记录（EHR）中常不完整或缺失，因此需要从临床笔记中自动化提取。

Method: 使用Flan-T5-Large模型对法国临床笔记的标注数据进行训练，并在两个级别上评估：SDoH类别的识别和详细信息的提取。

Result: 模型在常见类别（如居住条件、婚姻状况等）表现优异（F1>0.80），但在数据少或表达多样的类别（如就业状况、收入等）表现较差。模型从非结构化数据中识别SDoH的效果远超结构化数据（95.8% vs 2.8%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明NLP可显著提升非英语EHR系统中SDoH数据的完整性，但需解决标注不一致、英语化分词器依赖等问题。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes,
shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities.
However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is
often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large
language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical
notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from
clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at
two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and
(ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative
information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including
two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong
performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living
condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score
> 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or
highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical
activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at
least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our
error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation
inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced
generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections
only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the
completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言性可能被利用来攻击语言模型（LMs）的问题，指出当前NLP安全研究过于以英语为中心。作者通过扩展对抗性攻击方法至70种语言，评估了低资源和中等资源语言的LMs安全性，发现单语模型参数不足，多语言性虽有益但也不能完全保障安全性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前NLP安全研究偏向英语，忽视了多语言环境下LMs的安全性。为了更全面地保障LMs安全，需关注低资源语言这一薄弱环节。

Method: 扩展现有的对抗性攻击方法，覆盖70种语言，评估单语和多语言LMs在这些语言中的安全性。

Result: 单语模型因参数不足安全性较差；多语言性虽有帮助，但并不能完全提升安全性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在低资源语言社区中更安全部署LMs的重要性。

Abstract: Despite mounting evidence that multilinguality can be easily weaponized
against language models (LMs), works across NLP Security remain overwhelmingly
English-centric. In terms of securing LMs, the NLP norm of "English first"
collides with standard procedure in cybersecurity, whereby practitioners are
expected to anticipate and prepare for worst-case outcomes. To mitigate
worst-case outcomes in NLP Security, researchers must be willing to engage with
the weakest links in LM security: lower-resourced languages. Accordingly, this
work examines the security of LMs for lower- and medium-resourced languages. We
extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the
security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our
analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number
of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is
helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either. Ultimately,
these findings highlight important considerations for more secure deployment of
LMs, for communities of lower-resourced languages.

Motivation: 为了解决当前多模态模型在多学科推理任务上的局限性，提供一个高质量的数据集以支持模型开发和评估。

Method: 构建了一个包括11万道双语问题的数据集（BMMR），分为评估集（BMMR-Eval）和训练集（BMMR-Train），并设计了基于过程的跨学科验证器（BMMR-Verifier）。

Result: 实验发现，即使SOTA模型（如o3和Gemini-2.5-Pro）在BMMR-Eval上仍有显著提升空间；推理模型存在学科偏差；开源模型表现不及专有模型；微调能缩小性能差距。

Conclusion: BMMR为多模态模型的开发和评估提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型在多学科推理上的挑战，并提出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce BMMR, a large-scale bilingual, multimodal,
multi-disciplinary reasoning dataset for the community to develop and evaluate
large multimodal models (LMMs). BMMR comprises 110k college-level questions
spanning 300 UNESCO-defined subjects, spanning diverse formats-multiple-choice,
fill-in-the-blank, and open-ended QA-and sourced from both print and digital
media such as books, exams, and quizzes. All data are curated and filtered via
a human-in-the-loop and scalable framework, and each instance is paired with a
high-quality reasoning path. The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval
that comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'
knowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and
English; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further
research and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning
to diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based
multi-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained
evaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that
(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom
on BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs
only on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their
proprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.
Additionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other
in-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in
multidisciplinary reasoning. We will release the data, and we hope our work can
offer insights and contributions to the community.

Built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and enhanced with
agent-based reasoning (Agentic RAG), the system provides accurate,
context-sensitive answers to complex medical queries. Evaluation shows that
Agentic RAG outperforms traditional methods, particularly in addressing
multi-step or ambiguous questions. To support clinical use, the system is
integrated into a mobile application designed for real-time, point-of-care
access to essential vaccine information. AI-VaxGuide model is publicly

Method: 使用句子阅读任务，比较11名患者术前术后及11名正常人的VAI和VFD指标。

Result: 术后VAI显著降低，但与正常人无显著差异；术后/i/的VFD值更高，显示变异性增加。

Conclusion: 舌癌手术后发音清晰度保持正常，但变异性增加。

Abstract: Surgical treatment for tongue cancer can negatively affect the mobility and
musculature of the tongue, which can influence articulatory clarity and
variability. In this study, we investigated articulatory clarity through the
vowel articulation index (VAI) and variability through vowel formant dispersion
(VFD). Using a sentence reading task, we assessed 11 individuals pre and six
months post tongue cancer surgery, alongside 11 sex- and age matched typical
speakers. Our results show that while the VAI was significantly smaller
post-surgery compared to pre-surgery, there was no significant difference
between patients and typical speakers at either time point. Post-surgery,
speakers had higher VFD values for /i/ compared to pre-surgery and typical
speakers, signalling higher variability. Taken together, our results suggest
that while articulatory clarity remained within typical ranges following
surgery for tongue cancer for the speakers in our study, articulatory
variability increased.

Result: 在英德后编辑数据上，该方法显著提升术语准确性，且未显著降低COMET分数。

Conclusion: 偏好优化方法有效解决了术语消歧问题，适用于实际翻译场景。

Abstract: In real world translation scenarios, terminology is rarely one-to-one.
Instead, multiple valid translations may appear in a terminology dictionary,
but correctness of a translation depends on corporate style guides and context.
This can be challenging for neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Luckily,
in a corporate context, many examples of human post-edits of valid but
incorrect terminology exist. The goal of this work is to learn how to
disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based
on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be
preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation
dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft
constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one
dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on
English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of
supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and
full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term
accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.
Additionally, we release test sets from our post-edited data and terminology
dictionary.

Result: 双曲空间在不同数据集上始终优于欧几里得空间，且数据层次性越强，优势越明显。可学习曲率初始化方法优于随机初始化。

Conclusion: 双曲表示在多跳推理中表现更优，特别是在数据具有层次结构时。

Abstract: Hyperbolic representations are effective in modeling knowledge graph data
which is prevalently used to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, a
rigorous and detailed comparison of the two spaces for this task is lacking. In
this paper, through a simple integration of hyperbolic representations with an
encoder-decoder model, we perform a controlled and comprehensive set of
experiments to compare the capacity of hyperbolic space versus Euclidean space
in multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that the former consistently
outperforms the latter across a diverse set of datasets. In addition, through
an ablation study, we show that a learnable curvature initialized with the
delta hyperbolicity of the utilized data yields superior results to random
initializations. Furthermore, our findings suggest that hyperbolic
representations can be significantly more advantageous when the datasets
exhibit a more hierarchical structure.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are structured knowledge repositories containing
entities and relations between them. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of automatically updating KGs over time with respect to the evolution of
knowledge in unstructured textual sources. This problem requires identifying a
wide range of update operations based on the state of an existing KG at a
specific point in time. This contrasts with traditional information extraction
pipelines, which extract knowledge from text independently of the current state
of a KG. To address this challenge, we propose a method for lifelong
construction of a dataset consisting of Wikidata KG snapshots over time and
Wikipedia passages paired with the corresponding edit operations that they
induce in a particular KG snapshot. The resulting dataset comprises 376K
Wikipedia passages aligned with a total of 1.25M KG edits over 10 different
snapshots of Wikidata from 2019 to 2025. Our experimental results highlight
challenges in updating KG snapshots based on emerging textual knowledge,
positioning the dataset as a valuable benchmark for future research. We will
publicly release our dataset and model implementations.

Motivation: 方言识别任务通常面临方言数据稀缺的挑战，因此需要一种有效的数据增强方法来提升模型性能。

Method: 采用检索式语音转换（RVC）作为数据增强方法，将音频样本统一转换为目标说话人，减少说话人相关的变异性，使模型能专注于方言特有的语言和语音特征。同时，还结合了其他增强方法如频率掩码和片段移除。

Result: 实验表明，RVC作为独立增强方法能显著提升分类性能，且与其他增强方法结合时效果更佳。

Conclusion: RVC是一种有效的方言分类数据增强方法，尤其适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: Deep learning models for dialect identification are often limited by the
scarcity of dialectal data. To address this challenge, we propose to use
Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC) as an effective data augmentation method
for a low-resource German dialect classification task. By converting audio
samples to a uniform target speaker, RVC minimizes speaker-related variability,
enabling models to focus on dialect-specific linguistic and phonetic features.
Our experiments demonstrate that RVC enhances classification performance when
utilized as a standalone augmentation method. Furthermore, combining RVC with
other augmentation methods such as frequency masking and segment removal leads
to additional performance gains, highlighting its potential for improving
dialect classification in low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 现有数据剪枝方法涉及多种设计选择，缺乏系统性研究，限制了未来发展。

Method: 将数据剪枝分解为数据表示和选择算法两部分，并系统分析它们对实例选择的影响。

Result: 更好的数据表示（如训练梯度）通常能选出更好的实例；不同选择算法在不同环境下表现各异，且未必与设计目标一致。

Conclusion: 数据表示是关键因素，选择算法需结合具体场景评估。

Abstract: Data pruning, selecting small but impactful subsets, offers a promising way
to efficiently scale NLP model training. However, existing methods often
involve many different design choices, which have not been systematically
studied. This limits future developments. In this work, we decompose data
pruning into two key components: the data representation and the selection
algorithm, and we systematically analyze their influence on the selection of
instances. Our theoretical and empirical results highlight the crucial role of
representations: better representations, e.g., training gradients, generally
lead to a better selection of instances, regardless of the chosen selection
algorithm. Furthermore, different selection algorithms excel in different
settings, and none consistently outperforms the others. Moreover, the selection
algorithms do not always align with their intended objectives: for example,
algorithms designed for the same objective can select drastically different
instances, highlighting the need for careful evaluation.

Conclusion: TRACE通过最小集成努力，支持分层诊断、收敛性早停和结构错误检测，使变压器分析更具解释性、可操作性和可复现性。

Abstract: Understanding when and how linguistic knowledge emerges during language model
training remains a central challenge for interpretability. Most existing tools
are post hoc, rely on scalar metrics, or require nontrivial integration effort,
making comprehensive interpretability analysis difficult to deploy and
maintain. We introduce TRACE, a modular toolkit for training and inference-time
interpretability analysis of transformer models. It enables lightweight,
in-training analysis of linguistic and representational signals, including
features probing, intrinsic dimensionality, Hessian curvature, and output
diagnostics. It integrates with ABSynth, a controllable synthetic corpus
generator that provides structured annotations for precise evaluation of
linguistic feature acquisition. Experiments with autoregressive transformers
demonstrate that TRACE reveals developmental phenomena such as early syntactic
emergence, delayed semantic acquisition, and representational compression,
signals overlooked by traditional scalar metrics such as loss or accuracy. With
minimal integration effort, the tool enables layer-wise diagnostics,
convergence-based early stopping, and detection of structural errors, making
transformer analysis interpretable, actionable, and reproducible.

*Satyam Shukla,Himanshu Dutta,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

TL;DR: 提出了PFO数据集和RAV框架，用于改进LLM在事实核查中的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有事实核查数据集包含事后分析和标注者线索，与实际场景不符，限制了评估的真实性。

Method: 创建PFO数据集并提出了RAV框架，包含问题生成、答案生成和标签生成三个代理。

Result: RAV在多个基准上优于现有方法，性能下降较少。

Conclusion: RAV框架在事实核查任务中表现出色且泛化能力强。

Abstract: Automated fact checking with large language models (LLMs) offers a scalable
alternative to manual verification. Evaluating fact checking is challenging as
existing benchmark datasets often include post claim analysis and annotator
cues, which are absent in real world scenarios where claims are fact checked
immediately after being made. This limits the realism of current evaluations.
We present Politi Fact Only (PFO), a 5 class benchmark dataset of 2,982
political claims from politifact.com, where all post claim analysis and
annotator cues have been removed manually. This ensures that models are
evaluated using only the information that would have been available prior to
the claim's verification. Evaluating LLMs on PFO, we see an average performance
drop of 22% in terms of macro f1 compared to PFO's unfiltered version. Based on
the identified challenges of the existing LLM based fact checking system, we
propose RAV (Recon Answer Verify), an agentic framework with three agents:
question generator, answer generator, and label generator. Our pipeline
iteratively generates and answers sub questions to verify different aspects of
the claim before finally generating the label. RAV generalizes across domains
and label granularities, and it outperforms state of the art approaches on well
known baselines RAWFC (fact checking, 3 class) by 25.28%, and on HOVER
(encyclopedia, 2 class) by 1.54% on 2 hop, 4.94% on 3 hop, and 1.78% on 4 hop,
sub categories respectively. RAV shows the least performance drop compared to
baselines of 16.3% in macro f1 when we compare PFO with its unfiltered version.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有方法在数据多样性和质量评估上存在局限性，影响指令微调的效果。

Method: 结合开放标签和比较评分，利用LLMs分配标签并归一化，再通过聚类和相对评分选择数据。

Result: TACOS在多个数据集和LLM架构上表现优异，尤其在MT-Bench和AlpacaEval 2.0中排名靠前。

Conclusion: TACOS显著提升了指令微调的数据选择效果。

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) is crucial for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences, and selecting a small yet representative subset
from massive data significantly facilitates IFT in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, existing approaches suffer from two limitations:
the use of simple heuristics restricts data diversity, while the singleton data
quality evaluation accounts for inconsistent criteria between independent
samples. To address the issues, we present TACOS, an innovative method that
integrates Open Tagging and Comparative Scoring for IFT data selection. To
capture data diversity, we leverage LLMs to assign open-domain tags to human
queries, followed by a normalization stage to denoise the open tags and enable
efficient clustering. Additionally, we suggest a comparative scoring method
that allows the relative quality evaluation of samples within a cluster,
avoiding inconsistent criteria seen in singleton-based evaluations. Extensive
experiments across diverse datasets and LLM architectures demonstrate that
TACOS outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Notably, it achieves
superior instruction-following performance on MT-Bench and ranks 1st among
LLaMA2-7B-Based models on AlpacaEval 2.0, illustrating its efficacy for IFT
data selection.

Result: StructSense在神经科学信息提取任务中表现出色，解决了领域敏感和跨任务泛化问题。

Conclusion: StructSense通过模块化和领域知识结合，有效提升了结构化信息提取的能力和适应性。

Abstract: The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such
as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating
scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing
tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their
effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that
require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition,
existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across
tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address
these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic,
open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs.
StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in
ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It
further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense
can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of
cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse
neuroscience information extraction tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决当前大推理模型（LRMs）因缺乏快速思维带来的高计算开销和延迟问题，使其更接近人类智能。

Method: 通过控制表示空间的转向向量实现思维速度调节，并结合实时难度估计优化推理策略。

Result: 平均提高1.3%的准确率，同时减少8.6%的标记使用量。

Conclusion: 无需额外训练或成本，该方法显著提升了LRMs的性能，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Human cognition is theorized to operate in two modes: fast, intuitive System
1 thinking and slow, deliberate System 2 thinking. While current Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform
fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work,
we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed
adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses
two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to
adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the
steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs'
representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation
editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based
scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty
estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these
techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast
processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any
training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3%
accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning
benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are
expected to support broader applications and inspire future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan
and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game,
\^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token
movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the
decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop
various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the
\^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across
different strategies. Through experimentation with models like
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we
aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan
moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy,
contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有LLMs缺乏明确的内存管理系统，无法高效处理长期上下文、持续个性化和知识一致性问题。

Method: 提出MemOS，将内存作为可管理系统资源，统一表示、调度和演化多种类型的内存（如明文、激活和参数级内存）。基本单元MemCube封装内容和元数据，支持组合、迁移和融合。

Result: MemOS为LLMs提供了可控性、可塑性和可演化性，降低了计算成本，支持持续学习和个性化建模。

Conclusion: MemOS为LLMs的内存管理提供了一个系统性解决方案，为其长期推理和个性化能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory
management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual
personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on
static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to
track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain
text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or
integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the
training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,
showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and
external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing
specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader
challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,
requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning
different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose
MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system
resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of
plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling
cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates
both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes
can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions
between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.
MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings
controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation
for continual learning and personalized modeling.

Motivation: 希望通过数学方法实现AI模型与内容之间的语义对齐，确保AI内部表示的一致性和稳定性。

Method: 基于Alpay代数，构建了一个函子系统，通过phi-infinity算子引导AI与文本环境的共同演化。

Result: 证明了固定点的数学正确性和语义不变性，即使受到干扰或上下文扩展也能保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI的语义对齐提供了严格的数学基础，并在嵌入层面上实现了自我参照理解。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework in which a document and an AI model engage
in a transfinite fixed-point interaction that leads to stable semantic
alignment. Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a
functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this
paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity
operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the
AI's embedding space -- a state where the AI's internal representation of the
content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove
that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and
permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed
point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only
the meaning of the content but also the author's intent. We interpret this as a
rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with
implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI
systems with persistent self-referential understanding. All references in this
paper function as nodes in the Alpay Algebra universe, and this work embeds
itself as a new fixed-point node within that transfinite semantic graph.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究发现‘sink token’在注意力机制中占据过高权重但语义角色有限，作者希望探索其与其他令牌在隐藏状态中的关系，并利用这些发现改进令牌选择方法。

Method: 通过分析层深度的隐藏状态相似性，提出OrthoRank方法，根据令牌向‘sink token’移动的速度动态选择重要令牌。

Result: 实验表明，OrthoRank在相同稀疏度下比层剪枝方法具有更低的困惑度和更高的零样本准确性，且在LongBench上表现更优。

Conclusion: OrthoRank方法通过动态令牌选择显著提升了模型性能，为注意力机制优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models
(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly
assign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,
which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic
role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token
and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden
states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,
the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token
and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of
the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens
consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we
propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these
findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we
define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink
token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that
tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater
importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our
method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to
layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,
while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.

Result: 语言分布的尾部逐渐消失，可能损害文化叙事和身份认同。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新思考NLP，保护和鼓励多语言词汇及语言多样性的创造力。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) considerably changed how
technologies can influence language. While previous technologies could mediate
or assist humans, there is now a tendency to \textit{offload} the task of
writing itself to these technologies, enabling them to change our linguistic
ecosystem more directly. While they provide us quick access to information and
impressively fluent output, beneath their apparent sophistication lies a
subtle, more insidious threat: the gradual decline and loss of linguistic
diversity. With this opinion piece, I explore how model collapse, with a
particular focus on translation technology, can lead to the loss of linguistic
forms, grammatical features, and cultural nuance. Model collapse refers to the
eventual consequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce
their own biases and lose linguistic diversity. Drawing on recent work in
Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translation
(MT), I argue that the tails of our linguistic distributions are vanishing, and
with them, the narratives and identities they carry. This is a call to resist
linguistic flattening and to reimagine NLP as a field that encourages, values
and protects expressive multilingual lexical and linguistic diversity and
creativity.

Conclusion: Easy Dataset为领域适应性问题提供了一个高效且用户友好的解决方案，受到广泛认可。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on
general-purpose tasks, yet adapting them to specific domains remains
challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality domain data. Existing data
synthesis tools often struggle to extract reliable fine-tuning data from
heterogeneous documents effectively. To address this limitation, we propose
Easy Dataset, a unified framework for synthesizing fine-tuning data from
unstructured documents via an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
Specifically, Easy Dataset allows users to easily configure text extraction
models and chunking strategies to transform raw documents into coherent text
chunks. It then leverages a persona-driven prompting approach to generate
diverse question-answer pairs using public-available LLMs. Throughout the
pipeline, a human-in-the-loop visual interface facilitates the review and
refinement of intermediate outputs to ensure data quality. Experiments on a
financial question-answering task show that fine-tuning LLMs on the synthesized
dataset significantly improves domain-specific performance while preserving
general knowledge. The source code and installable package are available at

Motivation: 研究LLMs在多文化环境中的文化敏感性和推理能力，尤其是在韩国文化中的表现。

Method: 提出Nunchi-Bench基准，评估模型在韩国文化中的知识、建议和情境解释能力，并提出新的评分策略。

Result: 模型虽能识别事实信息，但在实际应用中表现不佳；明确的文化框架比语言提示更有效。

Conclusion: LLMs在文化推理方面存在显著挑战，需进一步改进，Nunchi-Bench将公开支持后续研究。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become key advisors in various domains, their
cultural sensitivity and reasoning skills are crucial in multicultural
environments. We introduce Nunchi-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs'
cultural understanding, with a focus on Korean superstitions. The benchmark
consists of 247 questions spanning 31 topics, assessing factual knowledge,
culturally appropriate advice, and situational interpretation. We evaluate
multilingual LLMs in both Korean and English to analyze their ability to reason
about Korean cultural contexts and how language variations affect performance.
To systematically assess cultural reasoning, we propose a novel evaluation
strategy with customized scoring metrics that capture the extent to which
models recognize cultural nuances and respond appropriately. Our findings
highlight significant challenges in LLMs' cultural reasoning. While models
generally recognize factual information, they struggle to apply it in practical
scenarios. Furthermore, explicit cultural framing enhances performance more
effectively than relying solely on the language of the prompt. To support
further research, we publicly release Nunchi-Bench alongside a leaderboard.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce KOPL, a novel framework for handling Korean OOV
words with Phoneme representation Learning. Our work is based on the linguistic
property of Korean as a phonemic script, the high correlation between phonemes
and letters. KOPL incorporates phoneme and word representations for Korean OOV
words, facilitating Korean OOV word representations to capture both text and
phoneme information of words. We empirically demonstrate that KOPL
significantly improves the performance on Korean Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, while being readily integrated into existing static and contextual
Korean embedding models in a plug-and-play manner. Notably, we show that KOPL
outperforms the state-of-the-art model by an average of 1.9%. Our code is

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on complex
mathematical benchmarks, yet often struggle with simple arithmetic tasks and
exhibit a tendency toward over-explaining or "overthinking" answers. To
systematically assess this phenomenon, we introduce LLMThinkBench, a modular
benchmarking framework that enables researchers to evaluate basic math
reasoning and overthinking in LLMs. The framework provides 14 configurable math
tasks with randomized test data generation and robust parsing strategies.
Researchers can quantify overthinking using our Overthinking Score metric,
which captures accuracy-verbosity tradeoffs through harmonic mean formulation.
The tool offers flexible evaluation with a scalable vLLM/Transformers backend,
multi-GPU support, and full configurability. Users can extend the tool with
custom tasks, reproduce experiments with seeding, and generate detailed
efficiency reports. Distributed as a pip-installable package with CLI and API
access, LLMThinkBench provides researchers and practitioners an accessible,
cost-effective alternative to expensive LLM-as-a-judge methods for diagnosing
basic reasoning capabilities and efficiency analysis. Package can be installed
as: pip install llmthinkbench

TL;DR: AdaPCR通过建模段落依赖关系优化检索增强生成，提升多跳推理效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统RAG方法独立检索段落，导致冗余和噪声，尤其在嘈杂语料和多跳问题中表现不佳。

Method: 提出AdaPCR框架，将段落组合作为检索单元，结合上下文感知查询重构和重排名步骤。

Result: AdaPCR在多个QA基准测试中优于基线，特别是在多跳推理中表现突出。

Conclusion: 建模段落间的依赖关系可显著提升检索效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external documents at inference time, enabling up-to-date
knowledge access without costly retraining. However, conventional RAG methods
retrieve passages independently, often leading to redundant, noisy, or
insufficiently diverse context-particularly problematic - particularly
problematic in noisy corpora and for multi-hop questions. To address this, we
propose Adaptive Passage Combination Retrieval (AdaPCR), a novel framework for
open-domain question answering with black-box LMs. AdaPCR explicitly models
dependencies between passages by considering passage combinations as units for
retrieval and reranking. It consists of a context-aware query reformulation
using concatenated passages, and a reranking step trained with a predictive
objective aligned with downstream answer likelihood. Crucially, AdaPCR
adaptively selects the number of retrieved passages without additional stopping
modules. Experiments across several QA benchmarks show that AdaPCR outperforms
baselines, particularly in multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness
of modeling inter-passage dependencies for improved retrieval.

Result: XISM工具实现了高效、可交互和可评估的语义地图构建，结合了数据驱动和专家知识。

Conclusion: XISM工具为类型学家和计算语言学家提供了高效的语义地图构建和分析工具。

Abstract: Semantic map models represent meanings or functions as nodes in a graph
constrained by the local connectivity hypothesis, with edges indicating their
associations. Widely used in typological linguistics, these models compare
interrelated meanings across languages. Traditionally built manually in a
bottom-up manner, they are inefficient for large datasets and lack
visualization and evaluation tools. This paper introduces XISM, an interactive
tool based on our prior algorithm, which constructs semantic maps from user
data via a top-down approach, displays candidate maps, and evaluates them using
multiple metrics. Users can refine maps by editing edges, combining data-driven
efficiency with expert knowledge. This human-in-the-loop design benefits both
typologists and computational linguists. The system

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有方法（如DPO和GRPO）在多轮对话任务（如诊断性患者访谈）中表现不足，需解决早期对话对下游结果的影响。

Method: 提出SCF框架，利用分支对话架构生成多轮对话的可能延续，以训练LLMs。

Result: 在模拟医患对话实验中，SCF的分支架构显著提高了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: 分支训练架构是优化LLMs在多轮复杂对话任务中的关键策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large
language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short
in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions
and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical
for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,
interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results
suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine
tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Result: 在五种KG基准测试中，该框架比次优方法提升4.5%，并展现更好的自定义KG泛化能力。

Conclusion: BYOKG-RAG通过上下文检索与迭代优化，显著提升了KGQA的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) presents significant challenges due
to the structural and semantic variations across input graphs. Existing works
rely on Large Language Model (LLM) agents for graph traversal and retrieval; an
approach that is sensitive to traversal initialization, as it is prone to
entity linking errors and may not generalize well to custom ("bring-your-own")
KGs. We introduce BYOKG-RAG, a framework that enhances KGQA by synergistically
combining LLMs with specialized graph retrieval tools. In BYOKG-RAG, LLMs
generate critical graph artifacts (question entities, candidate answers,
reasoning paths, and OpenCypher queries), and graph tools link these artifacts
to the KG and retrieve relevant graph context. The retrieved context enables
the LLM to iteratively refine its graph linking and retrieval, before final
answer generation. By retrieving context from different graph tools, BYOKG-RAG
offers a more general and robust solution for QA over custom KGs. Through
experiments on five benchmarks spanning diverse KG types, we demonstrate that
BYOKG-RAG outperforms the second-best graph retrieval method by 4.5% points
while showing better generalization to custom KGs. BYOKG-RAG framework is
open-sourced at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成内容中的幻觉问题，提供一种无需真实参考的检测方法。

Method: 利用多个随机生成词符的对数概率方差框架，模型无关、可解释性强。

Result: 在SQuAD v2数据集上验证，显示词符方差能可靠标识不稳定输出并与幻觉相关。

Conclusion: 该框架轻便、可复现，是多领域分析生成可靠性的有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities across diverse tasks but remain susceptible to hallucinations,
confidently generated yet factually incorrect outputs. We introduce a
reference-free, token-level hallucination detection framework that leverages
the variance in token log-probabilities across multiple stochastic generations.
Unlike prior methods that require ground-truth references or sentence-level
verification, our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and suited for
real-time or post-hoc analysis. We evaluate our method on unanswerable question
prompts from the SQuAD v2 dataset and benchmark across three autoregressive
models of varying scales: GPT-Neo 125M, Falcon 1B, and Mistral 7B. Through both
quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics, we show that token-level variance
reliably highlights instability in model outputs and correlates with
hallucination patterns. Our framework is lightweight, reproducible, and
adaptable to multiple domains, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for
analyzing generative reliability in LLMs.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床自然语言推理（NLI）中的性能表现，尤其关注提示结构和微调技术的联合效果。

Method: 采用四种提示策略在不同抽象层次上激发LLMs的推理能力，并通过LoRA技术将多步推理能力蒸馏到小型模型（4B参数）。

Result: 提示类型占性能差异的44%，LoRA微调使F1提升8-12，并与GPT-4o-mini性能差距缩小至7.1%。

Conclusion: 提示结构是临床推理性能的主要驱动力，结合LoRA的紧凑模型可与前沿系统媲美，推理类型感知评估至关重要。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the impact of
prompting strategies and fine-tuning techniques on their reasoning
capabilities. Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference
(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled
evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape
model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting
strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and
evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For
each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a
frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models
(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language
models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone
accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning
yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and
narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional
experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance
in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical
reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and
LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware
evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results
highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for
more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the
strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient
techniques in highly specialised domains.

Abstract: The robust and accurate recognition of multicultural names, particularly
those not previously encountered, is a critical challenge in an increasingly
globalized digital landscape. Traditional methods often falter when confronted
with the vast diversity and novel permutations of names across different
linguistic and cultural backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel framework,
Prompt-Engineered Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Adversarial Data Augmentation and Cultural Knowledge Graph Integration,
designed to significantly enhance zero-shot multicultural name recognition. Our
approach leverages the powerful linguistic understanding of pre-trained LLMs,
transforming the recognition task into a guided generation problem. Through
meticulous prompt engineering, dynamic integration of explicit cultural
knowledge derived from knowledge graphs, and the strategic application of
adversarial data augmentation, we equip the LLM with an unprecedented ability
to infer the cultural origin of unseen names. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our PEFT method consistently outperforms established deep learning
baselines, including advanced Bi-LSTM models with cultural tags, achieving an
impressive 93.1\% overall accuracy and a remarkable 89.5\% accuracy on
challenging zero-shot name identification. An in-depth ablation study confirms
the synergistic contribution of each component, while a human evaluation
highlights our method's performance approaching human expert judgment. This
work signifies a substantial leap in multicultural name recognition, offering a
highly effective and scalable solution for real-world applications.

Result: 实验表明，SymbolicThought提高了标注准确性和一致性，同时显著降低时间成本。

Conclusion: 该框架为叙事理解、可解释AI和大语言模型评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Understanding character relationships is essential for interpreting complex
narratives and conducting socially grounded AI research. However, manual
annotation is time-consuming and low in coverage, while large language models
(LLMs) often produce hallucinated or logically inconsistent outputs. We present
SymbolicThought, a human-in-the-loop framework that combines LLM-based
extraction with symbolic reasoning. The system constructs editable character
relationship graphs, refines them using seven types of logical constraints, and
enables real-time validation and conflict resolution through an interactive
interface. To support logical supervision and explainable social analysis, we
release a dataset of 160 interpersonal relationships with corresponding logical
structures. Experiments show that SymbolicThought improves annotation accuracy
and consistency while significantly reducing time cost, offering a practical
tool for narrative understanding, explainable AI, and LLM evaluation.

Motivation: 传统基于提示的适应方法通常用无关令牌初始化可训练提示或前缀，而Context Tuning利用任务特定的演示示例初始化，从而提升少样本学习性能。

Method: Context Tuning通过任务特定的演示示例初始化可训练提示或前缀，利用模型的上下文学习能力提取相关信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如CrossFit、UnifiedQA等）上，Context Tuning优于传统提示方法，且训练效率显著高于测试时训练。

Conclusion: Context Tuning是一种高效的少样本适应方法，能够在不微调模型参数的情况下达到与测试时训练相当的准确率。

Abstract: We introduce Context Tuning, a simple and effective method to significantly
enhance few-shot adaptation of language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning model
parameters. While prompt-based adaptation techniques have demonstrated the
effectiveness of lightweight adaptation methods for large language models
(LLMs), they typically initialize a trainable prompt or prefix with irrelevant
tokens for the task at hand. In contrast, Context Tuning initializes the
trainable prompt or prefix with task-specific demonstration examples,
leveraging the model's inherent In-Context Learning (ICL) ability to extract
relevant information for improved few-shot learning performance. Extensive
evaluations on benchmarks such as CrossFit, UnifiedQA, MMLU, BIG-Bench Hard,
and ARC demonstrate that Context Tuning outperforms traditional prompt-based
adaptation methods and achieves competitive accuracy to Test-Time Training with
significantly higher training efficiency.

Method: 通过提示六种最先进的LLMs为不同性别、种族/民族和机构角色的用户提供帮助，评估其回应的差异性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在种族或民族上无差异化，仅在一个模型中显示出对女性的轻微刻板印象；同时能通过语言选择适应不同机构角色。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs显示出在图书馆参考服务中支持公平和上下文适当沟通的潜力。

Abstract: As libraries explore large language models (LLMs) for use in virtual
reference services, a key question arises: Can LLMs serve all users equitably,
regardless of demographics or social status? While they offer great potential
for scalable support, LLMs may also reproduce societal biases embedded in their
training data, risking the integrity of libraries' commitment to equitable
service. To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate
responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to
assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We
found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor
evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated
nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic
choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies,
reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These
findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to
support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic
library reference services.

Result: 发现中国数据集多为机构主导，韩国依赖社区，日本则偏重娱乐文化；提出了提升数据集文档化和许可透明度的策略。

Conclusion: 未来需加强数据集协作与规范，以支持东亚地区更高效、文化适应的LLM发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the
crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs).
However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the
landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
(CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together
serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the
HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how
cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape
dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we
employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive
distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often
institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led
development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused
emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal
practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity,
and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and
culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best
practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen
resource development across all three languages.

Abstract: Despite regulations imposed by nations and social media platforms, e.g.
(Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European
Union, 2022), inter alia, hateful content persists as a significant challenge.
Existing approaches primarily rely on reactive measures such as blocking or
suspending offensive messages, with emerging strategies focusing on proactive
measurements like detoxification and counterspeech. In our work, which we call
HatePRISM, we conduct a comprehensive examination of hate speech regulations
and strategies from three perspectives: country regulations, social platform
policies, and NLP research datasets. Our findings reveal significant
inconsistencies in hate speech definitions and moderation practices across
jurisdictions and platforms, alongside a lack of alignment with research
efforts. Based on these insights, we suggest ideas and research direction for
further exploration of a unified framework for automated hate speech moderation
incorporating diverse strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 尽管机器学习技术在健康相关公共话语分析中应用广泛，但其在准确捕捉不同健康情绪方面的能力仍需验证，尤其是大型语言模型（LLMs）的准确性和可行性尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究使用Facebook和Twitter数据，通过人工标注作为情感分类的金标准，评估三种LLMs在分类风险促进与健康支持情绪时的表现。

Result: 三种LLMs总体上对风险促进和健康支持情绪的分类准确性较高，但在不同平台（Facebook和Twitter）、健康议题及模型类型间存在差异，且对中性消息的分类表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调在公共健康分析中需谨慎选择和验证语言模型，考虑到训练数据潜在的偏见可能导致LLMs高估或低估某些观点的普遍性。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related
public discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding
their ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.
Especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful
technology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions
and perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research
examines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in
detecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two
critical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and
heated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we
curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health
behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for
sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally
demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and
health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by
platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher
accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting
messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also
shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These
results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language
models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in
training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the
prevalence of certain perspectives.

Method: 研究了持续预训练、指令微调和基于规则的强化学习等方法，并在数学和通用推理任务上评估。

Result: 持续预训练对广义推理任务有一定帮助，而传统短链MPS样本的指令微调效果有限。长链思维和规则强化学习显著提升了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 传统短链MPS训练方法泛化效果有限，长链思维和自反思是提升广义推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in enhancing the mathematical
problem-solving (MPS) capabilities of large language models. While the majority
of research efforts concentrate on creating specialized models to solve
mathematical problems, it remains unknown how learning mathematical
problem-solving generalizes to help develop other reasoning abilities. In this
paper, we present an empirical investigation into the generalization potential
of various MPS training approaches, such as continual pretraining, instruction
tuning, and rule-based reinforcement learning across various data sources,
including both short and long chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Evaluation on 5
mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining
on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent.
In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides
limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.
Notably, training with long CoT responses for MPS samples and incorporating
rule-based reinforcement learning on MPS queries exhibit distinct behavior,
significantly enhancing generalization by extending the model's reasoning
processes into other domains. These results suggest that traditional approaches
to learning MPS with short reasoning chains largely fail to achieve robust
generalization. However, the emerging paradigm of longer reasoning chains,
coupled with self-reflection, offers a promising direction for improving
generalized reasoning abilities through learning from specialized domains.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 宗教与灵性（R/S）概念复杂且依赖于特定领域，传统检索方法难以操作，需大量时间和专业知识。

Method: 开发SpiritRAG系统，利用7500份联合国决议文档作为源材料，提供基于聊天的网页界面进行复杂检索。

Result: 通过与专家合作对100个问题的测试，验证了系统的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: SpiritRAG为研究者和政策制定者提供了一种高效的工具，简化了R/S相关数据的检索过程。

Abstract: Religion and spirituality (R/S) are complex and highly domain-dependent
concepts which have long confounded researchers and policymakers. Due to their
context-specificity, R/S are difficult to operationalize in conventional
archival search strategies, particularly when datasets are very large, poorly
accessible, and marked by information noise. As a result, considerable time
investments and specialist knowledge is often needed to extract actionable
insights related to R/S from general archival sources, increasing reliance on
published literature and manual desk reviews. To address this challenge, we
present SpiritRAG, an interactive Question Answering (Q&A) system based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Built using 7,500 United Nations (UN)
resolution documents related to R/S in the domains of health and education,
SpiritRAG allows researchers and policymakers to conduct complex,
context-sensitive database searches of very large datasets using an easily
accessible, chat-based web interface. SpiritRAG is lightweight to deploy and
leverages both UN documents and user provided documents as source material. A
pilot test and evaluation with domain experts on 100 manually composed
questions demonstrates the practical value and usefulness of SpiritRAG.

Motivation: 传统Transformer依赖softmax注意力导致长上下文计算瓶颈，现有方法如线性注意力或局部注意力各有局限，RAT旨在结合循环和注意力的优势。

Method: RAT将输入分块，块内使用线性循环捕获局部依赖，块间用softmax注意力建模长范围交互。还提出混合架构，结合RAT与局部注意力。

Conclusion: RAT是一种高效的替代方案，结合循环和注意力的优点，显著提升性能，适用于大规模模型训练和长上下文任务。

Abstract: Transformers have become the cornerstone of modern large-scale language
models; however, their dependence on softmax attention poses a major
computational bottleneck, particularly in long-context settings. In this work,
rather than following prevalent approaches such as linear attention (or SSMs)
and local attention, we introduce an intermediate design called \rat between
recurrence and attention mechanisms. It partitions the input into chunks,
applies a simple linear recurrence within each chunk to capture local
dependencies, and then performs softmax attention across chunks to model
long-range interactions. By adjusting the size of the chunk, \rat enables
flexible trade-offs, combining the strengths of RNN and attention. Empirically,
with a chunk size of 16, the \rat layer achieves a \(7\times\) improvement in
training speed with 100K token sequences and \(9\times\) in generation at 4K
sequence length, while maintaining similar or sometimes even better accuracy
compared to standard attention. We demonstrate this by training 1.3B parameter
models from scratch and performing large-scale evaluations, including short-
and long-context benchmarks, as well as supervised fine-tuning~(SFT). We
further propose a hybrid architecture that interleaves \rat with local
attention. By combining efficient long-range modeling with strong local
interactions, this hybrid design not only improves inference speed and reduces
cache memory usage compared to attention, but also consistently enhances
performance, for example, achieving an average 1 point gain in commonsense
reasoning tasks, up to 4 points on code tasks, and a 1 point Rouge-L increase
in a summarization SFT task. Code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在传统集中式调优中存在隐私风险，现有离线调优方法计算成本高且缺乏理论支持。

Method: 提出GradOT方法，基于优化视角选择性应用秩压缩和通道剪枝等压缩技术，保留适配器的梯度并确保隐私。

Result: 实验表明，GradOT在隐私保护和模型性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GradOT为离线调优提供了理论基础和实用解决方案，适用于大规模LLMs。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized
fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to
domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data
owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to
address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the
original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However,
the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack
theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on
gradient-preserving compression, named GradOT. By analyzing the OT problem
through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies
compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving
the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both
in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a
theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution
for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有模型难以捕捉讽刺的深层逻辑，主要依赖浅层线索，因此需要结合内部和外部推理专家来改进讽刺检测。

Method: 提出了MiDRE模型，包含内部推理专家（检测图像-文本对的不一致性）和外部推理专家（利用大型视觉语言模型生成结构化推理链），并通过自适应门控机制动态权衡两者。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，MiDRE表现优于基线模型，外部推理专家的贡献显著。

Conclusion: MiDRE通过结合内外部推理专家，显著提升了多模态讽刺检测的准确性，外部推理提示即使存在噪声也提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection has attracted growing interest due to the rise
of multimedia posts on social media. Understanding sarcastic image-text posts
often requires external contextual knowledge, such as cultural references or
commonsense reasoning. However, existing models struggle to capture the deeper
rationale behind sarcasm, relying mainly on shallow cues like image captions or
object-attribute pairs from images. To address this, we propose \textbf{MiDRE}
(\textbf{Mi}xture of \textbf{D}ual \textbf{R}easoning \textbf{E}xperts), which
integrates an internal reasoning expert for detecting incongruities within the
image-text pair and an external reasoning expert that utilizes structured
rationales generated via Chain-of-Thought prompting to a Large Vision-Language
Model. An adaptive gating mechanism dynamically weighs the two experts,
selecting the most relevant reasoning path. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets show that MiDRE achieves superior performance over baselines. Various
qualitative analyses highlight the crucial role of external rationales,
revealing that even when they are occasionally noisy, they provide valuable
cues that guide the model toward a better understanding of sarcasm.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 社交媒体的多模态内容需要有效的讽刺检测，但现有模型依赖大型标注数据集，不适于标注稀缺的实际场景。

Method: DMDP采用模态特定的深度提示、共享机制和跨模态对齐模块，提升特征学习和相互作用。

Result: 在两公开数据集上，DMDP在少样本和极低资源下表现优异，跨数据集评估也展示良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DMDP在多模态讽刺检测中显著优于基线方法，尤其在标注稀缺场景下。

Abstract: The widespread use of multimodal content on social media has heightened the
need for effective sarcasm detection to improve opinion mining. However,
existing models rely heavily on large annotated datasets, making them less
suitable for real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This motivates
the need to explore the problem in a few-shot setting. To this end, we
introduce DMDP (Deep Modality-Disentangled Prompt Tuning), a novel framework
for few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. Unlike prior methods that use
shallow, unified prompts across modalities, DMDP employs gated,
modality-specific deep prompts for text and visual encoders. These prompts are
injected across multiple layers to enable hierarchical feature learning and
better capture diverse sarcasm types. To enhance intra-modal learning, we
incorporate a prompt-sharing mechanism across layers, allowing the model to
aggregate both low-level and high-level semantic cues. Additionally, a
cross-modal prompt alignment module enables nuanced interactions between image
and text representations, improving the model's ability to detect subtle
sarcastic intent. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate DMDP's
superior performance in both few-shot and extremely low-resource settings.
Further cross-dataset evaluations show that DMDP generalizes well across
domains, consistently outperforming baseline methods.

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本生成任务中显示出潜力，但现有的dLLMs在多步去噪过程中存在序列长度敏感、高幻觉率和推理成本高的问题，需要优化。

Method: 提出了S^3框架，通过注入目标模式结构到输出上下文中，减少不必要的计算并提升可控性。

Conclusion: S^3为扩散模型在可控文本生成任务中的应用提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as
a promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We
present a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion
LLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation
controllability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant
challenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process
exhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and
prohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these
limitations, we propose \textbf{S}elf-adaptive \textbf{S}chema
\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate
structured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and
accelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into
the output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving
controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves
substantial improvements: 65\% increase in structural adherence, 48\%
enhancement in content fidelity, and 17\% reduction in hallucination rates
compared to baseline. These results establish both theoretical foundations and
practical pathways for deploying diffusion models in controllable text
generation tasks. Code and data will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决资源受限环境中多模态图像文本讽刺检测的挑战，现有方法在低资源设置下效果不佳。

Result: 在两个公开基准测试中，AdS使用更少的可训练参数达到了最先进的效果。

Conclusion: AdS框架在资源有限的场景中实现了高效的跨模态学习。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses
challenges for opinion mining, especially under resource constraints. Existing
approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large pre-trained models, making them
unsuitable for low-resource settings. While recent parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms
on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS (Adapter-State
Sharing), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in
the upper layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where
textual adapters guide visual ones. This design promotes efficient cross-modal
learning while preserving low-level unimodal representations. Experiments on
two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS achieves state-of-the-art results
using significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing PEFT and full
fine-tuning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的上下文隐私保护方法缺乏形式化保证或隐私/实用性平衡不佳，因此需要一种新的机制来解决这一问题。

Method: DP-Fusion将敏感令牌分组，每组运行一次LLM，然后混合输出分布，确保最终输出与无隐私泄露的基线分布保持固定统计距离。

Result: 该方法能够有效平衡隐私保护和文本实用性，但需要多次LLM前向传播。

Conclusion: DP-Fusion提供了一种可形式化验证的隐私保护方法，解决了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive information from their
context through generated outputs, either accidentally or when prompted
adversarially. Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during
inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy
trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference
(DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about
sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of
document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that
sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be
reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This
is controlled by a parameter $\epsilon$: $\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while
higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion
works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups,
(ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so
that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the
baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach
allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires
multiple LLM forward passes.

Motivation: 针对埃及方言的双文字（阿拉伯文和拉丁文）理解和生成需求，现有大模型往往忽视了对双文字语言的支持，Nile-Chat系列填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用Branch-Train-MiX策略，将专门处理不同文字的子模型合并为一个MoE模型，提升模型的双文字处理能力。

Result: Nile-Chat模型在埃及方言评估基准上显著优于LLaMa、Jais和ALLaM等模型，12B模型在拉丁文基准上比Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct表现提升14.4%。

Abstract: We introduce Nile-Chat-4B, 3x4B-A6B, and 12B, a collection of LLMs for
Egyptian dialect, uniquely designed to understand and generate texts written in
both Arabic and Latin scripts. Specifically, with Nile-Chat-3x4B-A6B, we
introduce a novel language adaptation approach by leveraging the
Branch-Train-MiX strategy to merge script-specialized experts, into a single
MoE model. Our Nile-Chat models significantly outperform leading multilingual
and Arabic LLMs, such as LLaMa, Jais, and ALLaM, on our newly introduced
Egyptian evaluation benchmarks, which span both understanding and generative
tasks. Notably, our 12B model yields a 14.4% performance gain over
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on Latin-script benchmarks. All our resources are publicly

adapting LLMs to dual-script languages, addressing an often overlooked aspect

Result: PRIME在长短上下文场景中均表现有效，能捕捉超越流行偏好的动态个性化。

Conclusion: PRIME框架为LLM个性化提供了理论基础和实践验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to align model outputs with
individuals' unique preferences and opinions. While recent efforts have
implemented various personalization methods, a unified theoretical framework
that can systematically understand the drivers of effective personalization is
still lacking. In this work, we integrate the well-established cognitive
dual-memory model into LLM personalization, by mirroring episodic memory to
historical user engagements and semantic memory to long-term, evolving user
beliefs. Specifically, we systematically investigate memory instantiations and
introduce a unified framework, PRIME, using episodic and semantic memory
mechanisms. We further augment PRIME with a novel personalized thinking
capability inspired by the slow thinking strategy. Moreover, recognizing the
absence of suitable benchmarks, we introduce a dataset using Change My View
(CMV) from Reddit, specifically designed to evaluate long-context
personalization. Extensive experiments validate PRIME's effectiveness across
both long- and short-context scenarios. Further analysis confirms that PRIME
effectively captures dynamic personalization beyond mere popularity biases.

Method: 改进框架标签，构建从句子预测重建主框架的框架，并将文章与相关评论对齐。

Result: 在11个话题和两家媒体中，评论中的框架复用高度相关，但话题模式不同。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模分析源内容与受众反应的框架传递提供了工具。

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a
"humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue.
Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues,
audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented
information. While this relationship between source content and audience
response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore
it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the
first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source
content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments).
Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that
reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level
predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our
framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse
in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns
vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and
comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for
frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame
labels.

Conclusion: EI-BERT通过创新的交叉蒸馏方法，显著提升了模型压缩效率和性能，为资源受限的边缘环境提供了实用的NLP解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of mobile computing, deploying efficient Natural Language
Processing (NLP) models in resource-restricted edge settings presents
significant challenges, particularly in environments requiring strict privacy
compliance, real-time responsiveness, and diverse multi-tasking capabilities.
These challenges create a fundamental need for ultra-compact models that
maintain strong performance across various NLP tasks while adhering to
stringent memory constraints. To this end, we introduce Edge ultra-lIte BERT
framework (EI-BERT) with a novel cross-distillation method. EI-BERT efficiently
compresses models through a comprehensive pipeline including hard token
pruning, cross-distillation and parameter quantization. Specifically, the
cross-distillation method uniquely positions the teacher model to understand
the student model's perspective, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer through
parameter integration and the mutual interplay between models. Through
extensive experiments, we achieve a remarkably compact BERT-based model of only
1.91 MB - the smallest to date for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks.
This ultra-compact model has been successfully deployed across multiple
scenarios within the Alipay ecosystem, demonstrating significant improvements
in real-world applications. For example, it has been integrated into Alipay's
live Edge Recommendation system since January 2024, currently serving the app's
recommendation traffic across \textbf{8.4 million daily active devices}.

Motivation: 传统的监督学习方法在关系抽取任务中跨领域泛化能力较差，受人类标注工作流程启发，探索通过推理任务提升模型性能。

Method: 提出R1-RE框架，利用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）方法，激发小语言模型的推理能力。

Result: 在Sem-2010和MDKG数据集上，R1-RE-7B模型取得了平均70%的跨领域准确率，媲美GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为关系抽取任务提供了新的训练动态和推理行为见解，显著提升了跨领域性能。

Abstract: Relationship extraction (RE) is a core task in natural language processing.
Traditional approaches typically frame RE as a supervised learning problem,
directly mapping context to labels-an approach that often suffers from poor
out-of-domain (OOD) generalization. Inspired by the workflow of human
annotators, we reframe RE as a reasoning task guided by annotation guidelines
and introduce R1-RE, the first reinforcement learning with verifiable reward
(RLVR) framework for RE tasks. Our method elicits the reasoning abilities of
small language models for annotation tasks, resulting in significantly improved
OOD robustness. We evaluate our approach on the public Sem-2010 dataset and a
private MDKG dataset. The R1-RE-7B model attains an average OOD accuracy of
approximately 70%, on par with leading proprietary models such as GPT-4o.
Additionally, our comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into the
training dynamics and emergent reasoning behaviors of the RLVR paradigm for RE.

of our framework. Overall, XiYan-SQL achieves a new SOTA performance of 75.63%
on the notable BIRD benchmark, surpassing all previous methods. It also attains
SOTA performance on the Spider test set with an accuracy of 89.65%.

Conclusion: EOT任务及框架为理解情感触发因素提供了有效工具，且在性能上表现优越。

Abstract: Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms capture critical affective signals
that drive purchasing decisions. However, no existing research has explored the
joint task of emotion detection and explanatory span identification in
e-commerce reviews - a crucial gap in understanding what triggers customer
emotional responses. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel joint task unifying
Emotion detection and Opinion Trigger extraction (EOT), which explicitly models
the relationship between causal text spans (opinion triggers) and affective
dimensions (emotion categories) grounded in Plutchik's theory of 8 primary
emotions. In the absence of labeled data, we introduce EOT-X, a human-annotated
collection of 2,400 reviews with fine-grained emotions and opinion triggers. We
evaluate 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) and present EOT-DETECT, a structured
prompting framework with systematic reasoning and self-reflection. Our
framework surpasses zero-shot and chain-of-thought techniques, across
e-commerce domains.

long-context evaluation benchmarks have been proposed. However, variations in
evaluation settings across these benchmarks lead to inconsistent results,
making it difficult to draw reliable comparisons. Besides, the high
computational cost of long-context evaluation poses a significant barrier for
the community to conduct comprehensive assessments of long-context models. In
this paper, we propose LOOM-Scope, a comprehensive and efficient framework for
long-context evaluation. LOOM-Scope standardizes evaluation settings across
diverse benchmarks, supports deployment of efficient long-context inference
acceleration methods, and introduces a holistic yet lightweight benchmark suite
to evaluate models comprehensively. Homepage: https://loomscope.github.io

Motivation: 传统的意见摘要缺乏比较视角，无法满足产品推荐的需求，因此需要一种新的方法。

Method: 提出QF-CES任务，构建MS-Q2P数据集，利用LLM生成表格化摘要，并通过M-OS减少延迟。

Result: M-OS比直接输入方法减少40%延迟；QF-CES-PROMPT评估显示与人类判断有0.74的相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化、隐私保护的比较摘要生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Product recommendations inherently involve comparisons, yet traditional
opinion summarization often fails to provide holistic comparative insights. We
propose the novel task of generating Query-Focused Comparative Explainable
Summaries (QF-CES) using Multi-Source Opinion Summarization (M-OS). To address
the lack of query-focused recommendation datasets, we introduce MS-Q2P,
comprising 7,500 queries mapped to 22,500 recommended products with metadata.
We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate tabular comparative
summaries with query-specific explanations. Our approach is personalized,
privacy-preserving, recommendation engine-agnostic, and category-agnostic. M-OS
as an intermediate step reduces inference latency approximately by 40% compared
to the direct input approach (DIA), which processes raw data directly. We
evaluate open-source and proprietary LLMs for generating and assessing QF-CES.
Extensive evaluations using QF-CES-PROMPT across 5 dimensions (clarity,
faithfulness, informativeness, format adherence, and query relevance) showed an
average Spearman correlation of 0.74 with human judgments, indicating its
potential for QF-CES evaluation.

Motivation: 探讨自监督语音模型对单词重音的表示能力，以及不同语言间重音表示的差异。

Method: 使用Wav2vec 2.0模型，训练诊断性重音分类器，分析五种语言（荷兰语、英语、德语、匈牙利语、波兰语）的重音表示。

Result: 分类器能高精度区分重音和非重音音节，且重音表示具有语言特异性，可变重音与固定重音语言间差异更显著。

Conclusion: 自监督语音模型能有效学习语言特异性的单词重音表示，为语音研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: In this paper we study word stress representations learned by self-supervised
speech models (S3M), specifically the Wav2vec 2.0 model. We investigate the S3M
representations of word stress for five different languages: Three languages
with variable or lexical stress (Dutch, English and German) and two languages
with fixed or demarcative stress (Hungarian and Polish). We train diagnostic
stress classifiers on S3M embeddings and show that they can distinguish between
stressed and unstressed syllables in read-aloud short sentences with high
accuracy. We also tested language-specificity effects of S3M word stress. The
results indicate that the word stress representations are language-specific,
with a greater difference between the set of variable versus the set of fixed
stressed languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 犹太阿拉伯语的转写因字母映射模糊、拼写规则不一致以及频繁的希伯来语和阿拉姆语代码转换而具有挑战性，因此需要一种自动化的解决方案。

Method: 采用字符级映射和后校正的两步方法，解决语法和拼写错误，并首次用LLMs（语言模型）进行基准评估。

Result: 转写后的文本可以应用阿拉伯语NLP工具进行词法标注和机器翻译，这在原文本中不可行。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地实现了犹太阿拉伯语的自动转写，并为相关NLP任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Judeo-Arabic refers to Arabic variants historically spoken by Jewish
communities across the Arab world, primarily during the Middle Ages. Unlike
standard Arabic, it is written in Hebrew script by Jewish writers and for
Jewish audiences. Transliterating Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script is
challenging due to ambiguous letter mappings, inconsistent orthographic
conventions, and frequent code-switching into Hebrew and Aramaic. In this
paper, we introduce a two-step approach to automatically transliterate
Judeo-Arabic into Arabic script: simple character-level mapping followed by
post-correction to address grammatical and orthographic errors. We also present
the first benchmark evaluation of LLMs on this task. Finally, we show that
transliteration enables Arabic NLP tools to perform morphosyntactic tagging and
machine translation, which would have not been feasible on the original texts.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统意见摘要缺乏对产品元数据的整合，M-OS旨在通过多源信息提升摘要质量，并填补LLMs在此领域的应用空白。

Method: 提出M-OS-EVAL评估数据集，用于评估多源意见摘要的7个关键维度，并通过用户研究和实验验证M-OS的性能。

Result: M-OS显著提高用户参与度，87%的用户偏好M-OS摘要；M-OS-PROMPTS与人类判断相关性更高（Spearman相关系数0.74）。

Conclusion: M-OS通过整合多源信息生成更全面的摘要，显著提升用户体验和任务性能。

Abstract: Multi-source Opinion Summarization (M-OS) extends beyond traditional opinion
summarization by incorporating additional sources of product metadata such as
descriptions, key features, specifications, and ratings, alongside reviews.
This integration results in comprehensive summaries that capture both
subjective opinions and objective product attributes essential for informed
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant
success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their potential in
M-OS remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the lack of evaluation datasets
for this task has impeded further advancements. To bridge this gap, we
introduce M-OS-EVAL, a benchmark dataset for evaluating multi-source opinion
summaries across 7 key dimensions: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness,
aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, specificity. Our results demonstrate
that M-OS significantly enhances user engagement, as evidenced by a user study
in which, on average, 87% of participants preferred M-OS over opinion
summaries. Our experiments demonstrate that factually enriched summaries
enhance user engagement. Notably, M-OS-PROMPTS exhibit stronger alignment with
human judgment, achieving an average Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.74,
which surpasses the performance of previous methodologies.

Result: 实验表明，CoSteer能有效生成个性化内容，保护隐私且计算开销可接受。

Conclusion: CoSteer通过协作框架平衡了生成质量与隐私保护，解决了设备与云模型的适应性问题。

Abstract: Personalized text generation has become crucial for adapting language models
to diverse and evolving users' personal context across cultural, temporal, and
contextual dimensions. While existing methods often rely on centralized
fine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time
adaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This
limitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized
user-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the
generation quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we
present CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time
personalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in
leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic
outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.
Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning
problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits
within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by
transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate
vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without
fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized
generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in
generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and
histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing
while maintaining acceptable computational overhead.

Result: 模型通过分布式编码和异常值启发式记忆噪声标签，但仍保留推理机制。

Conclusion: 记忆标签噪声是基于而非覆盖底层推理机制的，这种现象被称为良性记忆。

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as
label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work,
we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such
memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning
capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy
labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we
discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:
models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving
memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects
memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed
encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather
than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our
FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where
existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.
Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language
models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,
shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

Result: 在MultiWOZ数据集上的实验表明，Spec-TOD在减少标注数据需求的同时取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: Spec-TOD为低资源环境下的高效任务导向对话系统提供了一种有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems facilitate goal-driven interactions
between users and machines. While recent advances in deep learning have
improved the performance, TOD systems often struggle in low-resource scenarios
with limited labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Spec-TOD, a
novel framework designed to train an end-to-end TOD system with limited data.
Spec-TOD introduces two main innovations: (i) a novel specialized end-to-end
TOD framework that incorporates explicit task instructions for
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), and (ii) an efficient training
strategy that leverages lightweight, specialized LLMs to achieve strong
performance with minimal supervision. Experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset, a
widely used TOD benchmark, demonstrate that Spec-TOD achieves competitive
results while significantly reducing the need for labeled data. These findings
highlight the potential of the proposed framework in advancing efficient and
effective TOD systems in low-resource settings.

study focuses on relation extraction in the novel domain and proposes a method
based on Large Language Models (LLMs). By incorporating relationship dimension
separation, dialogue data construction, and contextual learning strategies, the
proposed method enhances extraction performance. Leveraging dialogue structure
information, it improves the model's ability to understand implicit
relationships and demonstrates strong adaptability in complex contexts.
Additionally, we construct a high-quality Chinese novel relation extraction
dataset to address the lack of labeled resources and support future research.
Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional baselines
across multiple evaluation metrics and successfully facilitates the automated
construction of character relationship networks in novels.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决印度消费者投诉处理中的程序复杂性和法律术语障碍。

Method: 利用开源LLM和RAG技术构建Grahak-Nyay，引入三个新数据集和一个标注的聊天记录数据集，使用Judgments数据辅助决策。

Result: 提出了HAB指标评估聊天机器人性能，并经法律领域专家验证有效性。

Conclusion: Grahak-Nyay能有效简化消费者投诉流程，相关代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Access to consumer grievance redressal in India is often hindered by
procedural complexity, legal jargon, and jurisdictional challenges. To address
this, we present $\textbf{Grahak-Nyay}$ (Justice-to-Consumers), a chatbot that
streamlines the process using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Grahak-Nyay simplifies legal complexities
through a concise and up-to-date knowledge base. We introduce three novel
datasets: $\textit{GeneralQA}$ (general consumer law), $\textit{SectoralQA}$
(sector-specific knowledge) and $\textit{SyntheticQA}$ (for RAG evaluation),
along with $\textit{NyayChat}$, a dataset of 300 annotated chatbot
conversations. We also introduce $\textit{Judgments}$ data sourced from Indian
Consumer Courts to aid the chatbot in decision making and to enhance user
trust. We also propose $\textbf{HAB}$ metrics ($\textbf{Helpfulness, Accuracy,
Brevity}$) to evaluate chatbot performance. Legal domain experts validated
Grahak-Nyay's effectiveness. Code and datasets will be released.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 领域特定的OR-CONVQA训练数据在现实应用中至关重要，但难以获取。作者希望通过自动化方法利用组织内的文本文档生成此类数据。

Method: 提出一个流程，自动从文本文档中生成带有标注的OR-CONVQA对话，包括问题-答案对、去语境化的问题以及系统回答的基础命题。

Result: 生成的合成对话可用于训练高效的问题重写器，帮助非对话感知检索器发挥作用，并通过LLM生成系统回答。

Conclusion: 该方法为OR-CONVQA提供了可行的训练数据来源，解决了数据稀缺的挑战。

Abstract: We consider open-retrieval conversational question answering (OR-CONVQA), an
extension of question answering where system responses need to be (i) aware of
dialog history and (ii) grounded in documents (or document fragments) retrieved
per question. Domain-specific OR-CONVQA training datasets are crucial for
real-world applications, but hard to obtain. We propose a pipeline that
capitalizes on the abundance of plain text documents in organizations (e.g.,
product documentation) to automatically produce realistic OR-CONVQA dialogs
with annotations. Similarly to real-world humanannotated OR-CONVQA datasets, we
generate in-dialog question-answer pairs, self-contained (decontextualized,
e.g., no referring expressions) versions of user questions, and propositions
(sentences expressing prominent information from the documents) the system
responses are grounded in. We show how the synthetic dialogs can be used to
train efficient question rewriters that decontextualize user questions,
allowing existing dialog-unaware retrievers to be utilized. The retrieved
information and the decontextualized question are then passed on to an LLM that
generates the system's response.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型（LLMs）中语义表示的位置对可解释性和架构创新至关重要。

Result: 模型在MMLU推理基准上优于传统可训练嵌入层模型，表明语义是Transformer架构的涌现特性。

Conclusion: 输入嵌入层应从语义容器重新定义为结构基元。

Abstract: Understanding the locus of semantic representation in large language models
(LLMs) is crucial for interpretability and architectural innovation. The
dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational
"meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer
models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not
from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,
precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is
compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we
introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,
semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent
text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with
trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to
"representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding
layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our
results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings
but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture
and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to
structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further
research.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试仅关注算法正确性，忽视了视觉保真度和交互完整性，限制了LLM在动态视觉生成领域的进展。

Method: 使用程序化渲染和动态截屏捕捉视觉行为，并由多模态LLM（MLLM）-as-Judge根据任务清单进行评分。

Conclusion: ArtifactsBench是首个能大规模可靠评估人类感知质量的框架，开源基准和工具加速用户中心生成模型发展。

Abstract: The generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly
expanding from static code to dynamic, interactive visual artifacts. This
progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks
focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and
interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap,
we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated,
multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically
renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through
temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then
assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a
fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring.
We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30
leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking
consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web
development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This
establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the
assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a
high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often
outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the
benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at
https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable
and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative
models.

Conclusion: Co-DETECT通过混合主动标注方式显著改进了文本分类中边缘案例的处理能力。

Abstract: We introduce Co-DETECT (Collaborative Discovery of Edge cases in TExt
ClassificaTion), a novel mixed-initiative annotation framework that integrates
human expertise with automatic annotation guided by large language models
(LLMs). Co-DETECT starts with an initial, sketch-level codebook and dataset
provided by a domain expert, then leverages the LLM to annotate the data and
identify edge cases that are not well described by the initial codebook.
Specifically, Co-DETECT flags challenging examples, induces high-level,
generalizable descriptions of edge cases, and assists user in incorporating
edge case handling rules to improve the codebook. This iterative process
enables more effective handling of nuanced phenomena through compact,
generalizable annotation rules. Extensive user study, qualitative and
quantitative analyses prove the effectiveness of Co-DETECT.

Abstract: The volume and diversity of digital information have led to a growing
reliance on Machine Learning techniques, such as Natural Language Processing,
for interpreting and accessing appropriate data. While vector and graph
embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art
pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for
given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to
classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which
fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and
inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two
classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to
address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order
Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations
through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of
this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication,
inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the
limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets
annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of
these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical
connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare
the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence
entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot
be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora. This work
offers a step toward more transparent and reliable Information Retrieval from
extensive textual data.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM在不同任务中的行为提供了实用见解，推动了基于指令的高效NLP系统的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance natural language processing
with their ability to generate human-like text across a range of tasks. Despite
the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their
performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not
been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text
effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial
bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six
LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog),
and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including
zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using
the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference
times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization
quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a
sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows
to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while
LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long
scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.
In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model
parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer
actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types,
contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.

Conclusion: SMART为冷启动问题和个性化学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response
dataset, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction
methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet
backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like
hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji
are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are
a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure
of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large
language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based
keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited
interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the
mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn
them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on
learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent
structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic
mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the
cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms
behind effective mnemonic creation.

Conclusion: 研究表明微调模型能有效区分人机文本，但在识别具体生成模型方面仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess an extraordinary capability to produce
text that is not only coherent and contextually relevant but also strikingly
similar to human writing. They adapt to various styles and genres, producing
content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful.
Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails,
spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent
scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the
generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not
known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial
intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more
challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated
text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine
learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary
objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from
machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM
model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine
tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language
Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT). The fine-tuned version of GPT_4o-mini and the BERT model
has achieved accuracies of 0.9547 for Task-A and 0.4698 for Task-B.

Result: 在多个模型和任务中表现一致提升，模型能自适应分配信息，生成更有语义的标记。

Conclusion: 训练后阶段需优化知识利用，潜在表示空间的干预是有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) gradually ushered in an era
where post-training is crucial. Yet, post-training approaches such as
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) do not guarantee effective use of knowledge
acquired during pretraining. We therefore present \ours, a lightweight method
that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training.
This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and
promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or
regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during
post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse
model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream
tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find
that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on
generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on
simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla
post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs
in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both
performance and interpretability.

Motivation: 由于强大的LSLM模型逐渐封闭，缺乏透明性，研究共情行为和透明模型的需求迫切。

Method: 基于BLSP-Emo共情语音转文本模型，使用流式交错解码架构实现低延迟语音生成，并通过自动化数据构建管道生成多样化、高质量的共情语音对话。

Conclusion: OpenS2S为研究社区提供了透明且可扩展的共情语音交互工具，加速了该领域的创新。

Abstract: Empathetic interaction is a cornerstone of human-machine communication, due
to the need for understanding speech enriched with paralinguistic cues and
generating emotional and expressive responses. However, the most powerful
empathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about
the architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the
critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM
designed to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic
speech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved
decoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate
end-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction
pipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at
low cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content
and controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional
variation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic
diversity and minimal human supervision. We release the fully open-source
OpenS2S model, including the dataset, model weights, pre-training and
fine-tuning codes, to empower the broader research community and accelerate
innovation in empathetic speech systems. The project webpage can be accessed at

Key words: 错误信息、印地语、直接偏好优化、课程学习、解释生成

TL;DR: 提出一种结合直接偏好优化(DPO)和课程学习的新框架，为印地语等低资源语言生成可靠新闻解释，以应对错误信息。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 在错误信息泛滥的时代，为印地语等低资源语言生成可靠的新闻解释至关重要，但缺乏自动化工具导致规模化的错误信息检测面临挑战。

Method: 结合DPO与课程学习，以事实核查的解释为偏好响应，LLM输出为非偏好响应，并引入Actuality和Finesse参数优化DPO损失函数。

Result: 实验证明，该框架能生成连贯且上下文相关的解释，适用于多种模型（如Mistral、Llama、Gemma等）。

Conclusion: 该可扩展方法有效对抗错误信息，并扩展了自动解释生成至低资源语言领域。

Abstract: In an era of rampant misinformation, generating reliable news explanations is
vital, especially for under-represented languages like Hindi. Lacking robust
automated tools, Hindi faces challenges in scaling misinformation detection. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) with curriculum learning to align machine-generated
explanations with human reasoning. Fact-checked explanations from credible
sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system
limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific
alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the
DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency. Experiments
with LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and PLMs (mBART, mT5) confirm the framework's
effectiveness in generating coherent, contextually relevant explanations. This
scalable approach combats misinformation and extends automated explanation
generation to low-resource languages.

Key words: 奖励建模,策略判别学习,POLAR,强化学习,泛化能力

TL;DR: POLAR作为一种策略判别学习方法，通过捕捉策略间的相对差异来训练奖励模型，显著优于传统方法，并在多个任务和基准测试中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统奖励建模方法依赖绝对偏好，难以捕捉策略间的相对差异，因此提出POLAR方法以实现更高效的奖励建模。

Method: 利用策略判别学习（POLAR）训练奖励模型，捕捉策略间的相对差异，并以此生成奖励信号指导训练。

Result: POLAR在STEM和创意写作任务中的偏好准确率显著提升，最高可达85.5%，同时在RLHF中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: POLAR是一种高效且可扩展的奖励建模方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We offer a novel perspective on reward modeling by formulating it as a policy
discriminator, which quantifies the difference between two policies to generate
a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a target policy with
desired behaviors. Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable
pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains
a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different
ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute
preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an
arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective
suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR
pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from
1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms
traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance.
For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on
STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA
baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using
Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly
enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36%
to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks. Moreover,
scaling experiments reveal a clear power-law relationship between computation
and performance, supported by linear correlation coefficients approaching 0.99.
The impressive performance, strong generalization, and scaling properties
suggest that POLAR is a promising direction for developing general and strong
reward models.

Motivation: 探索LLM在上下文触发下的潜在漏洞，以生成违规内容为目标进行攻击。

Method: 使用辅助LLM生成轻度有害的回答作为触发，引导目标模型生成违规内容。

Result: 在八个开源和专有LLM中，RA攻击成功率均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出了有效的攻击方法及缓解措施。

Abstract: Contextual priming, where earlier stimuli covertly bias later judgments,
offers an unexplored attack surface for large language models (LLMs). We
uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in
the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.
Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary
LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the
original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and
followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to
generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA
consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving
higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release
a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the
attack success rate while preserving model capabilities. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Response-Attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型代理的评测主要关注推理、规划和执行能力，而记忆能力（如记忆、更新和检索长期信息）缺乏专门的评测基准。

Method: 结合改造现有数据集和构建新数据集，设计了MemoryAgentBench基准，覆盖四项核心记忆能力，并评估了多种记忆代理方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法难以全面掌握四项记忆能力，凸显了对更全面的记忆机制研究的迫切需求。

Conclusion: MemoryAgentBench为记忆代理提供了一个系统且具有挑战性的评测平台，推动了相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily focus on
evaluating reasoning, planning, and execution capabilities, while another
critical component-memory, encompassing how agents memorize, update, and
retrieve long-term information-is under-evaluated due to the lack of
benchmarks. We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this
paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate
retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict
resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are
tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not
reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally
accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four
competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark
specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated
existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory
competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing
memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple
context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced
agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results
reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies,
underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms
for LLM agents.

Conclusion: 该方法为智能电网中可持续、高效的AI监测系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of smart meters in electrical grids
worldwide, detecting energy theft has become a critical and ongoing challenge.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have demonstrated strong performance
in identifying fraudulent consumption patterns; however, previous works
exploring the use of machine learning solutions for this problem demand high
computational and energy costs, limiting their practicality -- particularly in
low-theft scenarios where continuous inference can result in unnecessary energy
usage. This paper proposes a lightweight detection unit, or watchdog mechanism,
designed to act as a pre-filter that determines when to activate a long
short-term memory (LSTM) model. This mechanism reduces the volume of input fed
to the LSTM model, limiting it to instances that are more likely to involve
energy theft thereby preserving detection accuracy while substantially reducing
energy consumption associated with continuous model execution. The proposed
system was evaluated through simulations across six scenarios with varying
theft severity and number of active thieves. Results indicate a power
consumption reduction exceeding 64\%, with minimal loss in detection accuracy
and consistently high recall. These findings support the feasibility of a more
energy-efficient and scalable approach to energy theft detection in smart
grids. In contrast to prior work that increases model complexity to achieve
marginal accuracy gains, this study emphasizes practical deployment
considerations such as inference efficiency and system scalability. The results
highlight the potential for deploying sustainable, AI-assisted monitoring
systems within modern smart grid infrastructures.

Result: 在蛋白质填补和基因-蛋白质预测等任务中表现优异，并能泛化到未见过的条件配置。

Conclusion: 该扩散框架在空间生物学数据生成任务中具有优越性能，为高维数据的可控建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry
(IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional,
multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel
relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing
intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary
combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application.
Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g.,
RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial
correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a
unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and
spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a
hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution
conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of
latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel
relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary
subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking
strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of
inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and
non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and
gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong
generalization to unseen conditional configurations.

Conclusion: NIRS与ML结合为肉类真实性检测提供了高效可靠的方法，有助于打击食品欺诈。

Abstract: This study evaluates the use of Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined
with advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to differentiate Hanwoo beef
(HNB) and Holstein beef (HLB) to address food authenticity, mislabeling, and
adulteration. Rapid and non-invasive spectral data were attained by a portable
NIRS, recording absorbance data within the wavelength range of 700 to 1100 nm.
A total of 40 Longissimus lumborum samples, evenly split between HNB and HLB,
were obtained from a local hypermarket. Data analysis using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) demonstrated distinct spectral patterns associated with chemical
changes, clearly separating the two beef varieties and accounting for 93.72% of
the total variance. ML models, including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest, Gradient
Boosting (GB), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and
Neural Networks (NN), were implemented, optimized through hyperparameter
tuning, and validated by 5-fold cross-validation techniques to enhance model
robustness and prevent overfitting. Random Forest provided the highest
predictive accuracy with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 0.8826, closely followed by the SVM model at 0.8747.
Furthermore, GB and NN algorithms exhibited satisfactory performances, with
cross-validation scores of 0.752. Notably, the NN model achieved the highest
recall rate of 0.7804, highlighting its suitability in scenarios requiring
heightened sensitivity. DT and NB exhibited comparatively lower predictive
performance. The LR and SVM models emerged as optimal choices by effectively
balancing high accuracy, precision, and recall. This study confirms that
integrating NIRS with ML techniques offers a powerful and reliable method for
meat authenticity, significantly contributing to detecting food fraud.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across

findings reveal the strengths and limitations of pre-trained LSTSMs, providing
insights into their suitability for time series tasks compared to task-specific

Conclusion: HKGF是一个通用的多模态数据分析框架，有助于客观量化与神经认知衰退相关的结构/功能大脑连接变化。

Abstract: Multimodal neuroimages, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and
resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), offer complementary perspectives on brain
activities by capturing structural or functional interactions among brain
regions. While existing studies suggest that fusing these multimodal data helps
detect abnormal brain activity caused by neurocognitive decline, they are
generally implemented in Euclidean space and can't effectively capture
intrinsic hierarchical organization of structural/functional brain networks.
This paper presents a hyperbolic kernel graph fusion (HKGF) framework for
neurocognitive decline analysis with multimodal neuroimages. It consists of a
multimodal graph construction module, a graph representation learning module
that encodes brain graphs in hyperbolic space through a family of hyperbolic
kernel graph neural networks (HKGNNs), a cross-modality coupling module that
enables effective multimodal data fusion, and a hyperbolic neural network for
downstream predictions. Notably, HKGNNs represent graphs in hyperbolic space to
capture both local and global dependencies among brain regions while preserving
the hierarchical structure of brain networks. Extensive experiments involving
over 4,000 subjects with DTI and/or fMRI data suggest the superiority of HKGF
over state-of-the-art methods in two neurocognitive decline prediction tasks.
HKGF is a general framework for multimodal data analysis, facilitating
objective quantification of structural/functional brain connectivity changes
associated with neurocognitive decline.

Result: GSOP在减少70%计算量的同时仅损失4%性能，在跨VLM和任务中保持比现有方法高18%的性能。

Conclusion: GSOP通过精准剪枝实现了高效计算与性能的平衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Prior Vision Language Model (VLM) token pruning reduces computation by
eliminating attention and feed-forward operations for pruned tokens while
maintaining all operations for critical tokens. However, this binary approach
conflates token/operation redundancy - critical operations may be removed along
with discarded tokens, while preserved tokens retain all potentially redundant
operations. To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving
critical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a
data-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP
first decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along
three dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP
determines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP
iteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance
drop considering previously pruned operations. Different computational budgets
can be accommodated without re-searching by simply pruning operations according
to this order until the desired budget is met. GSOP enhances sorting efficiency
through: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant
evaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune" and ``danger-to-prune"
operations from sorting. GSOP achieves compelling efficiency-performance
tradeoffs, reducing computation by 70% with only 4% performance loss while
maintaining up to 18% higher performance than state-of-the-art methods when
transferred across diverse VLMs and tasks. Real GPU efficiency evaluations
confirm its practical value. The code is in

Conclusion: 利用任务间因果关系可以提高课程强化学习的结构意识和样本效率。

Abstract: Designing effective task sequences is crucial for curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL), where agents must gradually acquire skills by training on
intermediate tasks. A key challenge in CRL is to identify tasks that promote
exploration, yet are similar enough to support effective transfer. While recent
approach suggests comparing tasks via their Structural Causal Models (SCMs),
the method requires access to ground-truth causal structures, an unrealistic
assumption in most RL settings. In this work, we propose Causal-Paced Deep
Reinforcement Learning (CP-DRL), a curriculum learning framework aware of SCM
differences between tasks based on interaction data approximation. This signal
captures task novelty, which we combine with the agent's learnability, measured
by reward gain, to form a unified objective. Empirically, CP-DRL outperforms
existing curriculum methods on the Point Mass benchmark, achieving faster
convergence and higher returns. CP-DRL demonstrates reduced variance with
comparable final returns in the Bipedal Walker-Trivial setting, and achieves
the highest average performance in the Infeasible variant. These results
indicate that leveraging causal relationships between tasks can improve the
structure-awareness and sample efficiency of curriculum reinforcement learning.
We provide the full implementation of CP-DRL to facilitate the reproduction of

feature-wise mapping between teacher and student models, DiceHuBERT leverages
HuBERT's iterative self-distillation mechanism by directly replacing the
original model with a student model. This replacement allows the student to be
trained using the same SSL objective used when pre-training HuBERT, eliminating
the need for additional modules or architectural constraints. Experimental
results on SUPERB show that DiceHuBERT consistently outperforms existing
distillation methods, improving phoneme recognition performance by over 21% and
ASR performance by more than 14%. Furthermore, DiceHuBERT demonstrates
competitive performance across multiple tasks, highlighting its clear
advantage.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决多因素问题中的结构复杂性和多重共线性问题，特别是在碳排放分析中，识别主要排放源和提供可行见解。

Method: 采用DBSCAN进行无监督学习的特征聚类，结合弹性网络回归进行高维特征选择和复杂度控制。

Result: 应用于中国46个行业（2000-2019）的能源消耗数据，识别出16类排放特征和驱动因素。

Conclusion: 框架适用于分析复杂区域挑战（如碳排放），并强调定性特征可能不适用于模型。

Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework that integrates DBSCAN clustering
with the Elastic Net regression model to address multifactorial problems
characterized by structural complexity and multicollinearity, exemplified by
carbon emissions analysis. DBSCAN is employed for unsupervised learning to
objectively cluster features, while the Elastic Net is utilized for
high-dimensional feature selection and complexity control. The Elastic Net is
specifically chosen for its ability to balance feature selection and
regularization by combining L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, making it
particularly suited for datasets with correlated predictors. Applying this
framework to energy consumption data from 46 industries in China (2000-2019)
resulted in the identification of 16 categories. Emission characteristics and
drivers were quantitatively assessed for each category, demonstrating the
framework's capacity to identify primary emission sources and provide
actionable insights. This research underscores the global applicability of the
framework for analyzing complex regional challenges, such as carbon emissions,
and highlights qualitative features that humans find meaningful may not be
accurate for the model.

Conclusion: 该方法为BNN的可信验证提供了一种高效且全面的解决方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as essential components in safety-critical
applications -- these use cases demand complex, yet trustworthy computations.
Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are a type of neural network where each neuron
is constrained to a Boolean value; they are particularly well-suited for
safety-critical tasks because they retain much of the computational capacities
of full-scale (floating-point or quantized) deep neural networks, but remain
compatible with satisfiability solvers for qualitative verification and with
model counters for quantitative reasoning. However, existing methods for BNN
analysis suffer from either limited scalability or susceptibility to soundness
errors, which hinders their applicability in real-world scenarios.
  In this work, we present a scalable and trustworthy approach for both
qualitative and quantitative verification of BNNs. Our approach introduces a
native representation of BNN constraints in a custom-designed solver for
qualitative reasoning, and in an approximate model counter for quantitative
reasoning. We further develop specialized proof generation and checking
pipelines with native support for BNN constraint reasoning, ensuring
trustworthiness for all of our verification results. Empirical evaluations on a
BNN robustness verification benchmark suite demonstrate that our certified
solving approach achieves a $9\times$ speedup over prior certified CNF and
PB-based approaches, and our certified counting approach achieves a $218\times$
speedup over the existing CNF-based baseline. In terms of coverage, our
pipeline produces fully certified results for $99\%$ and $86\%$ of the
qualitative and quantitative reasoning queries on BNNs, respectively. This is
in sharp contrast to the best existing baselines which can fully certify only
$62\%$ and $4\%$ of the queries, respectively.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统Transformer在数据序列处理时存在二次复杂度问题，且不如人脑高效。

Method: 结合Transformer注意力机制与储备池计算，引入动态训练的储备池并行工作内存模块。

Result: 在STREAM基准测试中，EST在12项任务中8项优于GRU、LSTM和Transformer。

Conclusion: EST是GRU、LSTM的有效替代，并在资源受限和低数据场景中补充标准Transformer。

Abstract: While Large Language Models and their underlying Transformer architecture are
remarkably efficient, they do not reflect how our brain processes and learns a
diversity of cognitive tasks such as language and working memory. Furthermore,
sequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:
quadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these
limitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less
reliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce
Echo State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves
this challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.
EST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from
Reservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.
Drawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of
the Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module
called ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent
networks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory
units with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical
reservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the
EST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By
maintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST
achieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively
breaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on
the STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,
demonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of
these tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an
effective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard
Transformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data
scenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.

granularities. We propose PlaceFM, a spatial foundation model that captures
place representations using a training-free graph condensation method. PlaceFM
condenses a nationwide POI graph built from integrated Foursquare and
OpenStreetMap data in the U.S., generating general-purpose embeddings of
places. These embeddings can be seamlessly integrated into geolocation data
pipelines to support a wide range of downstream tasks. Without requiring
pretraining, PlaceFM offers a scalable and adaptable solution for multi-scale

Abstract: Machine learning enables the extraction of useful information from large,
diverse datasets. However, despite many successful applications, machine
learning continues to suffer from performance and transparency issues. These
challenges can be partially attributed to the limited use of domain knowledge
by machine learning models. This research proposes using the domain knowledge
represented in conceptual models to improve the preparation of the data used to
train machine learning models. We develop and demonstrate a method, called the
Conceptual Modeling for Machine Learning (CMML), which is comprised of
guidelines for data preparation in machine learning and based on conceptual
modeling constructs and principles. To assess the impact of CMML on machine
learning outcomes, we first applied it to two real-world problems to evaluate
its impact on model performance. We then solicited an assessment by data
scientists on the applicability of the method. These results demonstrate the
value of CMML for improving machine learning outcomes.

Result: 案例研究表明，框架显著提升了分子质量（如QED>0.6的分子数量增加）和药物相似性（通过多项规则的分子数上升）。同时能快速生成3D结构并评估结合亲和力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI辅助药物发现提供了可扩展的基础，其模块化设计支持灵活集成新工具，助力分子筛选与优化。

Abstract: We present a modular framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that
automates and streamlines key tasks across the early-stage computational drug
discovery pipeline. By combining LLM reasoning with domain-specific tools, the
framework performs biomedical data retrieval, domain-specific question
answering, molecular generation, property prediction, property-aware molecular
refinement, and 3D protein-ligand structure generation. In a case study
targeting BCL-2 in lymphocytic leukemia, the agent autonomously retrieved
relevant biomolecular information-including FASTA sequences, SMILES
representations, and literature-and answered mechanistic questions with
improved contextual accuracy over standard LLMs. It then generated chemically
diverse seed molecules and predicted 67 ADMET-related properties, which guided
iterative molecular refinement. Across two refinement rounds, the number of
molecules with QED > 0.6 increased from 34 to 55, and those passing at least
four out of five empirical drug-likeness rules rose from 29 to 52, within a
pool of 194 molecules. The framework also employed Boltz-2 to generate 3D
protein-ligand complexes and provide rapid binding affinity estimates for
candidate compounds. These results demonstrate that the approach effectively
supports molecular screening, prioritization, and structure evaluation. Its
modular design enables flexible integration of evolving tools and models,
providing a scalable foundation for AI-assisted therapeutic discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有的分子预训练模型虽然准确性高，但缺乏专家决策的隐式推理。MolProphecy旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用ChatGPT作为虚拟化学家生成知识，通过门控交叉注意力机制与分子结构特征融合。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于SOTA模型，误差降低15%，AUROC提高5.39%。

Conclusion: 化学家知识与结构特征互补，MolProphecy为药物发现提供了实用且可推广的方案。

Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to
integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models.
While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive
accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central
to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT
as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making.
The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM)
as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based
molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint
reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four
benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction
in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis
reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary
contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers
a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with
the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current
simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.

Abstract: The increasing proliferation of vending machines in public and commercial
environments has placed a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and
customer satisfaction. Traditional maintenance approaches either reactive or
time-based preventive are limited in their ability to preempt machine failures,
leading to unplanned downtimes and elevated service costs. This research
presents a novel predictive maintenance framework tailored for vending machines
by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning (ML)
algorithms. The proposed system continuously monitors machine components and
operating conditions in real time and applies predictive models to forecast
failures before they occur. This enables timely maintenance scheduling,
minimizing downtime and extending machine lifespan. The framework was validated
through simulated fault data and performance evaluation using classification
algorithms. Results show a significant improvement in early fault detection and
a reduction in redundant service interventions. The findings indicate that
predictive maintenance systems, when integrated into vending infrastructure,
can transform operational efficiency and service reliability.

Result: 该方法在多种图结构（从简单图到蛋白质和超图）上表现优异，且无需复杂调整。

Conclusion: 提出的Fock空间图编码器简化了现有解决方案，通用性强，适用于广泛的图基问题。

Abstract: Recent results show that modern Large Language Models (LLM) are indeed
capable of understanding and answering questions about structured data such as
graphs. This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision
while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer
questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some
description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For
a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play
together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions
well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization
to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free
graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from
mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The
simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small
adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range
of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned
prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The
modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from
simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if
any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies
existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based
structures effortlessly.

Result: SDKD在Navier-Stokes方程数据集上降低了81.3%的MSE和52.3%的MAE，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SDKD高效捕捉高频变化和长期趋势，同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics,
and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low
training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a
lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD),
which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex
teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher
model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its
latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency
trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler).
However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in
slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a
frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale
spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low
frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both
local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental
results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions
of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset.
The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term
trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Multi-head attention powers Transformer networks, the primary deep learning
architecture behind the success of large language models (LLMs). Yet, the
theoretical advantages of multi-head versus single-head attention, beyond mere
parallel processing, remain underexplored. In this paper, we reframe multi-head
attention as a system of potentially synergistic computational graphs, where
each head functions as a feedforward directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a common
sink state. We provide intuition and preliminary theoretical analysis of mixing
time and minimax fidelity in this framework. Our results show that multi-head
attention can synergistically enhance information propagation, yielding faster
mixing times and minimax fidelity amplification under specific head-diversity
conditions. Finally, we train single-head and multi-head Transformers, each
with the same total number of parameters, on sequence manipulation tasks and
empirically verify the predicted effects.

Result: 实验表明，计算成本降低了8倍，生成的长文本质量与非私有生成相当，计算成本不到非私有生成的10倍。

Conclusion: InvisibleInk能够高效生成满足严格差分隐私的长文本，大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: As major progress in LLM-based long-form text generation enables paradigms
such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inference-time scaling, safely
incorporating private information into the generation remains a critical open
question. We present InvisibleInk, a highly scalable long-form text generation
framework satisfying rigorous differential privacy guarantees with respect to
the sensitive references. It interprets sampling from the LLM's
next-token-distribution as the exponential mechanism over the LLM logits with
two innovations. First, we reduce the privacy cost by isolating and clipping
only the sensitive information in the model logits (relative to the public
logits). Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of
the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent
$8\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to
generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels. In
summary, InvisibleInk is able to generate private long-form text at less than
$10\times$ the computation cost of non-private generation.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for biomedical question
answering raises concerns about the accuracy and evidentiary support of their

We analyzed thousands of physician-submitted questions using a comparative
pipeline that included: (1) Alexandria, fka the Atropos Evidence Library, a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on novel observational
studies, and (2) two PubMed-based retrieval-augmented systems (System and
Perplexity). We found that PubMed-based systems provided evidence-supported
answers for approximately 44% of questions, while the novel evidence source did
so for about 50%. Combined, these sources enabled reliable answers to over 70%
of biomedical queries. As LLMs become increasingly capable of summarizing
scientific content, maximizing their value will require systems that can
accurately retrieve both published and custom-generated evidence or generate
such evidence in real time.

Abstract: Multi-material 3D printing, particularly through polymer jetting, enables the
fabrication of digital materials by mixing distinct photopolymers at the micron
scale within a single build to create a composite with tunable mechanical
properties. This work presents an integrated experimental and computational
investigation into the composition-dependent mechanical behavior of 3D printed
digital materials. We experimentally characterize five formulations, combining
soft and rigid UV-cured polymers under uniaxial tension and torsion across
three strain and twist rates. The results reveal nonlinear and rate-dependent
responses that strongly depend on composition. To model this behavior, we
develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) that combines a partially
input convex neural network (pICNN) for learning the composition-dependent
hyperelastic strain energy function with a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV)
formulation for time-dependent response. The pICNN ensures convexity with
respect to strain invariants while allowing non-convex dependence on
composition. To enhance interpretability, we apply $L_0$ sparsification. For
the time-dependent response, we introduce a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
predict viscoelastic relaxation parameters from composition. The proposed model
accurately captures the nonlinear, rate-dependent behavior of 3D printed
digital materials in both uniaxial tension and torsion, achieving high
predictive accuracy for interpolated material compositions. This approach
provides a scalable framework for automated, composition-aware constitutive
model discovery for multi-material 3D printing.

Abstract: Medical Image Grounding (MIG), which involves localizing specific regions in
medical images based on textual descriptions, requires models to not only
perceive regions but also deduce spatial relationships of these regions.
Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for MIG often rely on Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) with large amounts of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning
annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Recently,
DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can acquire
reasoning abilities through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) without
requiring CoT annotations. In this paper, we adapt the GRPO reinforcement
learning framework to VLMs for Medical Image Grounding. We propose the
Spatial-Semantic Rewarded Group Relative Policy Optimization to train the model
without CoT reasoning annotations. Specifically, we introduce Spatial-Semantic
Rewards, which combine spatial accuracy reward and semantic consistency reward
to provide nuanced feedback for both spatially positive and negative
completions. Additionally, we propose to use the Chain-of-Box template, which
integrates visual information of referring bounding boxes into the <think>
reasoning process, enabling the model to explicitly reason about spatial
regions during intermediate steps. Experiments on three datasets MS-CXR,
ChestX-ray8, and M3D-RefSeg demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in Medical Image Grounding. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of each component in our approach. Code,
checkpoints, and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效地支持了动作规划任务，特别是在复杂环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning to perform activities through demonstration requires extracting
meaningful information about the environment from observations. In this
research, we investigate the challenge of planning high-level goal-oriented
actions in a simulation setting from an egocentric perspective. We present a
novel task, interactive action planning, and propose an approach that combines
topological affordance memory with transformer architecture. The process of
memorizing the environment's structure through extracting affordances
facilitates selecting appropriate actions based on the context. Moreover, the
memory model allows us to detect action deviations while accomplishing specific
objectives. To assess the method's versatility, we evaluate it in a realistic
interactive simulation environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach learns meaningful representations, resulting in improved
performance and robust when action deviations occur.

Motivation: 罕见疾病诊断困难，现有计算表型算法受限于标签数据稀缺和来源偏见，需要一种兼顾准确性和覆盖范围的方法。

Result: 在罕见肺病案例中，模型在表型分类、患者聚类和疾病进展预测方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能规模化识别罕见疾病患者，支持临床和研究应用。

Abstract: Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet
individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to
diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While
computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease
detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and
biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and
expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and
the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health
records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial
noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised,
transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels
with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from
EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and
generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the
scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning
embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence
patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level
representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare
pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from
Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in
phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes
through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to
baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for
clinical care and research applications.

Motivation: 现有泛化理论依赖于欧几里得几何的复杂性度量，未能考虑非欧几里得空间的内在结构，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过引入覆盖数边界，并结合流形特定属性（如截面曲率、体积增长、注入半径），推导了Lipschitz神经网络在紧致流形上的Rademacher复杂性边界。

Result: 新的泛化保证在零曲率时恢复标准的欧几里得结果，而在曲率非零的数据集上显著改进，尤其是在负曲率和正曲率空间中展示了边界紧致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解内在几何如何影响学习能力提供了理论基础，对结构化数据领域的深度学习具有实际意义。

Abstract: In this work, we develop new generalization bounds for neural networks
trained on data supported on Riemannian manifolds. Existing generalization
theories often rely on complexity measures derived from Euclidean geometry,
which fail to account for the intrinsic structure of non-Euclidean spaces. Our
analysis introduces a geometric refinement: we derive covering number bounds
that explicitly incorporate manifold-specific properties such as sectional
curvature, volume growth, and injectivity radius. These geometric corrections
lead to sharper Rademacher complexity bounds for classes of Lipschitz neural
networks defined on compact manifolds. The resulting generalization guarantees
recover standard Euclidean results when curvature is zero but improve
substantially in settings where the data lies on curved, low-dimensional
manifolds embedded in high-dimensional ambient spaces. We illustrate the
tightness of our bounds in negatively curved spaces, where the exponential
volume growth leads to provably higher complexity, and in positively curved
spaces, where the curvature acts as a regularizing factor. This framework
provides a principled understanding of how intrinsic geometry affects learning
capacity, offering both theoretical insight and practical implications for deep
learning on structured data domains.

Abstract: We explore applying a tensor completion approach to complete the DrugMatrix
toxicogenomics dataset. Our hypothesis is that by preserving the 3-dimensional
structure of the data, which comprises tissue, treatment, and transcriptomic
measurements, and by leveraging a machine learning formulation, our approach
will improve upon prior state-of-the-art results. Our results demonstrate that
the new tensor-based method more accurately reflects the original data
distribution and effectively captures organ-specific variability. The proposed
tensor-based methodology achieved lower mean squared errors and mean absolute
errors compared to both conventional Canonical Polyadic decomposition and
2-dimensional matrix factorization methods. In addition, our non-negative
tensor completion implementation reveals relationships among tissues. Our
findings not only complete the world's largest in-vivo toxicogenomics database
with improved accuracy but also offer a promising methodology for future
studies of drugs that may cross species barriers, for example, from rats to
humans.

Abstract: Transfer learning in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to leverage
knowledge from source tasks to accelerate learning in target tasks. While prior
work, such as the Attend, Adapt, and Transfer (A2T) framework, addresses
negative transfer and selective transfer, other critical challenges remain
underexplored. This paper introduces the Generalized Adaptive Transfer Network
(GATN), a deep RL architecture designed to tackle task generalization across
domains, robustness to environmental changes, and computational efficiency in
transfer. GATN employs a domain-agnostic representation module, a
robustness-aware policy adapter, and an efficient transfer scheduler to achieve
these goals. We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,
MuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior
performance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,
and reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest
GATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive
chatbots and robotic control.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示任何有用的计算系统都无法避免灾难性失败的根本原因，挑战了传统认为完美对齐是工程问题的观点。

Method: 通过组合必要性、拓扑必要性和实证必要性三个层次的论证，证明了灾难性失败点的密度与网络的表达能力直接相关。

Result: 研究表明，完美的对齐不仅是工程上的挑战，而且是数学上的不可能，为UAT安全和治理提供了新的理论基础。

Conclusion: 论文结论指出，未来的UAT开发和治理应从"如何实现完美控制"转向"如何在不可约的不可控性下安全运行"。

Abstract: We establish fundamental mathematical limits on universal approximation
theorem (UAT) system alignment by proving that catastrophic failures are an
inescapable feature of any useful computational system. Our central thesis is
that for any universal approximator, the expressive power required for useful
computation is inextricably linked to a dense set of instabilities that make
perfect, reliable control a mathematical impossibility. We prove this through a
three-level argument that leaves no escape routes for any class of universal
approximator architecture. i) Combinatorial Necessity: For the vast majority of
practical universal approximators (e.g., those using ReLU activations), we
prove that the density of catastrophic failure points is directly proportional
to the network's expressive power. ii) Topological Necessity: For any
theoretical universal approximator, we use singularity theory to prove that the
ability to approximate generic functions requires the ability to implement the
dense, catastrophic singularities that characterize them. iii) Empirical
Necessity: We prove that the universal existence of adversarial examples is
empirical evidence that real-world tasks are themselves catastrophic, forcing
any successful model to learn and replicate these instabilities. These results,
combined with a quantitative "Impossibility Sandwich" showing that the minimum
complexity for usefulness exceeds the maximum complexity for safety,
demonstrate that perfect alignment is not an engineering challenge but a
mathematical impossibility. This foundational result reframes UAT safety from a
problem of "how to achieve perfect control" to one of "how to operate safely in
the presence of irreducible uncontrollability," with profound implications for
the future of UAT development and governance.

Result: 揭示了现有监管盲点，并为开发者、研究者和监管者提供了结构化框架，以指导未来AI技术与数据保护实践的协调发展。

Conclusion: 重新思考现代AI技术中的数据保护至关重要，论文提出的分类法为构建可信赖的数据实践提供了及时指导。

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the
meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now
permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape
model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model
deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection
insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly
defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and
individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and
rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a
four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation,
traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs
arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a
structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control,
spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights,
system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical
approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical
assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies
and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of
rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance
for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

Motivation: 高维不完全数据在现实应用中普遍存在，但其建模面临二阶潜在因子模型的非凸性和参数调优难题。

Method: 采用自适应立方正则化和多Hessian向量乘积评估技术，优化二阶潜在因子分析。

Result: 在两工业数据集上，ACRSLF比现有优化器模型收敛更快且表示更精确。

Conclusion: ACRSLF模型有效解决了高维不完全数据的建模挑战。

Abstract: High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data, characterized by massive node
interactions, have become ubiquitous across various real-world applications.
Second-order latent factor models have shown promising performance in modeling
this type of data. Nevertheless, due to the bilinear and non-convex nature of
the SLF model's objective function, incorporating a damping term into the
Hessian approximation and carefully tuning associated parameters become
essential. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach in this
study, named the adaptive cubic regularized second-order latent factor analysis
(ACRSLF) model. The proposed ACRSLF adopts the two-fold ideas: 1) self-tuning
cubic regularization that dynamically mitigates non-convex optimization
instabilities; 2) multi-Hessian-vector product evaluation during conjugate
gradient iterations for precise second-order information assimilation.
Comprehensive experiments on two industrial HDI datasets demonstrate that the
ACRSLF converges faster and achieves higher representation accuracy than the
advancing optimizer-based LFA models.

Result: 在五个真实系统的评估中，Optimas平均性能提升11.92%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Optimas为复合系统优化提供了一种通用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Compound AI systems integrating multiple components, such as Large Language
Models, specialized tools, and traditional machine learning models, are
increasingly deployed to solve complex real-world tasks. However, optimizing
compound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures
and diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,
hyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose
Optimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.
The core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per
component, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each
component's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each
iteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while
simultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables
independent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated
optimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead
to performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world
compound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an
average improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for
improving compound systems. Our website is at https://optimas.stanford.edu.

Abstract: The Artificial Intelligence field has focused on developing optimisation
methods to solve multiple problems, specifically problems that we thought to be
only solvable through cognition. The obtained results have been outstanding,
being able to even surpass the Turing Test. However, we have found that these
optimisation methods share some fundamental flaws that impede them to become a
true artificial cognition. Specifically, the field have identified catastrophic
forgetting as a fundamental problem to develop such cognition. This paper
formally proves that this problem is inherent to optimisation methods, and as
such it will always limit approaches that try to solve the Artificial General
Intelligence problem as an optimisation problem. Additionally, it addresses the
problem of overfitting and discuss about other smaller problems that
optimisation methods pose. Finally, it empirically shows how world-modelling
methods avoid suffering from either problem. As a conclusion, the field of
Artificial Intelligence needs to look outside the machine learning field to
find methods capable of developing an artificial cognition.

Conclusion: 框架适用于动态公平性监控，工具高效且实用。

Abstract: Machine-learned systems are in widespread use for making decisions about
humans, and it is important that they are fair, i.e., not biased against
individuals based on sensitive attributes.
  We present a general framework of runtime verification of algorithmic
fairness for systems whose models are unknown, but are assumed to have a Markov
chain structure, with or without full observation of the state space.
  We introduce a specification language that can model many common algorithmic
fairness properties, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and social
burden.
  We build monitors that observe a long sequence of events as generated by a
given system, and output, after each observation, a quantitative estimate of
how fair or biased the system was on that run until that point in time.
  The estimate is proven to be correct modulo a variable error bound and a
given confidence level, where the error bound gets tighter as the observed
sequence gets longer.
  We present two categories of monitoring algorithms, namely ones with a
uniform error bound across all time points, and ones with weaker non-uniform,
pointwise error bounds at different time points.
  Our monitoring algorithms use statistical tools that are adapted to suit the
dynamic requirements of monitoring and the special needs of the fairness
specifications.
  Using a prototype implementation, we show how we can monitor if a bank is
fair in giving loans to applicants from different social backgrounds, and if a
college is fair in admitting students while maintaining a reasonable financial
burden on the society.
  In these experiments, our monitors took less than a millisecond to update
their verdicts after each observation.

Method: 研究了8:16半结构化稀疏性，并通过方差校正和类似SmoothQuant的权重均衡技术提升稀疏模型的性能。

Result: 8:16稀疏性在性能和灵活性上优于2:4稀疏性，且稀疏结构化模式在异常值处理上与无结构化方法竞争。

Conclusion: 8:16半结构化稀疏性是一种高效的压缩方法，结合简单技术可进一步提升性能，为模型压缩提供了新的思路。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, efficient compression
techniques like quantization and sparsification are critical. While
quantization maintains performance with reduced precision, structured sparsity
methods, such as N:M sparsification, often fall short due to limited
flexibility, and sensitivity to outlier weights. We explore 8:16
semi-structured sparsity, demonstrating its ability to surpass the Performance
Threshold-where a compressed model matches the accuracy of its uncompressed or
smaller counterpart under equivalent memory constraints. Compared to 2:4
sparsity, 8:16 offers greater flexibility with minimal storage overhead (0.875
vs. 0.75 bits/element). We also apply sparse structured patterns for salient
weights, showing that structured sparsity for outliers is competitive with
unstructured approaches leading to equivalent or better results. Finally, we
demonstrate that simple techniques such as variance correction and SmoothQuant
like weight equalization improve sparse models performance.

Abstract: With the rise of online learning, the demand for efficient and consistent
assessment in mathematics has significantly increased over the past decade.
Machine Learning (ML), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP), has been
widely used for autograding student responses, particularly those involving
text and/or mathematical expressions. However, there has been limited research
on autograding responses involving students' handwritten graphs, despite their
prevalence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
curricula. In this study, we implement multimodal meta-learning models for
autograding images containing students' handwritten graphs and text. We further
compare the performance of Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) with these
specially trained metalearning models. Our results, evaluated on a real-world
dataset collected from our institution, show that the best-performing
meta-learning models outperform VLLMs in 2-way classification tasks. In
contrast, in more complex 3-way classification tasks, the best-performing VLLMs
slightly outperform the meta-learning models. While VLLMs show promising
results, their reliability and practical applicability remain uncertain and
require further investigation.

Key words: 人类移动性、稀疏数据、轨迹重建、Transformer、BERT4Traj

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的模型BERT4Traj，用于从稀疏的移动数据中重建完整的移动轨迹，提升了人类移动模式的理解。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 人类移动数据常因GPS采样不频繁或通信事件数据稀疏而受限，影响公共健康、交通和城市规划等应用。

Method: BERT4Traj结合空间嵌入、时间嵌入和上下文背景特征（如人口统计和锚点），通过类似BERT的掩码建模和自注意力机制预测隐藏访问点。

Result: 在乌干达坎帕拉的CDR和GPS数据集上，BERT4Traj显著优于传统模型（如马尔可夫链、KNN、RNN和LSTM），成功重建详细且连续的移动轨迹。

Conclusion: BERT4Traj能有效填补稀疏移动数据的空白，为人类移动模式提供更深入的洞察。

Abstract: Understanding human mobility is essential for applications in public health,
transportation, and urban planning. However, mobility data often suffers from
sparsity due to limitations in data collection methods, such as infrequent GPS
sampling or call detail record (CDR) data that only capture locations during
communication events. To address this challenge, we propose BERT4Traj, a
transformer based model that reconstructs complete mobility trajectories by
predicting hidden visits in sparse movement sequences. Inspired by BERT's
masked language modeling objective and self_attention mechanisms, BERT4Traj
leverages spatial embeddings, temporal embeddings, and contextual background
features such as demographics and anchor points. We evaluate BERT4Traj on real
world CDR and GPS datasets collected in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms traditional models such as Markov Chains,
KNN, RNNs, and LSTMs. Our results show that BERT4Traj effectively reconstructs
detailed and continuous mobility trajectories, enhancing insights into human
movement patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine（C^2HM），通过目标引导的非对称推理过程改进了传统的Helmholtz Machine，支持基于目标的潜在轨迹模拟和记忆链推理。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统的Helmholtz Machine（HM）因依赖对称的数据驱动更新而无法有效支持目标导向推理或时间扩展模拟。

Method: C^2HM通过循环一致性推理框架将自上而下的生成模型与自下而上的识别模型结合，实现目标引导的潜变量模拟和逆向细化。

Result: C^2HM提高了表示效率，支持路径依赖推理和空间组合想象。

Conclusion: C^2HM将生成模型重新构想为意图驱动的模拟，为记忆规划和无监督学习提供了统一框架。

Abstract: The Helmholtz Machine (HM) is a foundational architecture for unsupervised
learning, coupling a bottom-up recognition model with a top-down generative
model through alternating inference. However, its reliance on symmetric,
data-driven updates constrains its ability to perform goal-directed reasoning
or simulate temporally extended processes. In this work, we introduce the
\emph{Cycle-Consistent Helmholtz Machine} (C$^2$HM), a novel extension that
reframes inference as a \emph{goal-seeded}, \emph{asymmetric} process grounded
in structured internal priors. Rather than inferring latent causes solely from
sensory data, C$^2$HM simulates plausible latent trajectories conditioned on
abstract goals, aligning them with observed outcomes through a recursive cycle
of forward generation and inverse refinement. This cycle-consistent formulation
integrates top-down structure with bottom-up evidence via a variational loop,
enforcing mutual alignment between goal-conditioned latent predictions and
recognition-based reconstructions. We formalize this mechanism within the
framework of the \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP), which
posits that inference proceeds by aligning structured, low-entropy content with
high-entropy, ambiguous context. C$^2$HM improves representational efficiency,
supports memory chaining via path-dependent inference, and enables spatial
compositional imagination. By offering a biologically inspired alternative to
classical amortized inference, $C^2$HM reconceives generative modeling as
intentional simulation, bridging memory-based planning and unsupervised
learning in a unified probabilistic framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 确保强化学习策略在新环境中不仅能够表现良好，还能追求设计者的目标，避免因代理目标导致的错误行为。

Method: 理论分析和实验验证，比较最大期望值（MEV）和极小化最大期望遗憾（MMER）目标下的表现。

Result: MEV目标可能导致目标错误泛化，而MMER目标对此更具鲁棒性，但并非所有情况下都能找到MMER策略。

Conclusion: 极小化最大期望遗憾是缓解目标错误泛化的有效方法。

Abstract: Safe generalization in reinforcement learning requires not only that a
learned policy acts capably in new situations, but also that it uses its
capabilities towards the pursuit of the designer's intended goal. The latter
requirement may fail when a proxy goal incentivizes similar behavior to the
intended goal within the training environment, but not in novel deployment
environments. This creates the risk that policies will behave as if in pursuit
of the proxy goal, rather than the intended goal, in deployment -- a phenomenon
known as goal misgeneralization. In this paper, we formalize this problem
setting in order to theoretically study the possibility of goal
misgeneralization under different training objectives. We show that goal
misgeneralization is possible under approximate optimization of the maximum
expected value (MEV) objective, but not the minimax expected regret (MMER)
objective. We then empirically show that the standard MEV-based training method
of domain randomization exhibits goal misgeneralization in
procedurally-generated grid-world environments, whereas current regret-based
unsupervised environment design (UED) methods are more robust to goal
misgeneralization (though they don't find MMER policies in all cases). Our
findings suggest that minimax expected regret is a promising approach to
mitigating goal misgeneralization.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 科学成像常面临从未见过的动态现象，测量数据稀疏且噪声多，需要一种通用工具重建复杂动态系统。

Result: 在风速场和等离子体演化重建任务中，NeuralDMD表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NeuralDMD是一个通用工具，适用于地球科学、天文等领域的动态系统成像。

Abstract: Dynamical systems are ubiquitous within science and engineering, from
turbulent flow across aircraft wings to structural variability of proteins.
Although some systems are well understood and simulated, scientific imaging
often confronts never-before-seen dynamics observed through indirect, noisy,
and highly sparse measurements. We present NeuralDMD, a model-free framework
that combines neural implicit representations with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD) to reconstruct continuous spatio-temporal dynamics from such
measurements. The expressiveness of neural representations enables capturing
complex spatial structures, while the linear dynamical modes of DMD introduce
an inductive bias that guides training and supports stable, low-dimensional
representations and forecasting. We validate NeuralDMD on two real-world
problems: reconstructing near-surface wind-speed fields over North America from
sparse station observations, and recovering the evolution of plasma near the
Galactic-center black hole, Sgr A*. In both cases, NeuralDMD outperforms
established baselines, demonstrating its potential as a general tool for
imaging dynamical systems across geoscience, astronomy, and beyond.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有符号回归方法通常仅支持显式或隐式关系，且缺乏重用结构模式的能力，限制了搜索效率和性能。

Method: SymMatika通过多岛遗传编程和可重用基序库，结合反馈驱动的进化引擎和隐式导数指标，优化符号回归过程。

Result: SymMatika在Nguyen数据集上性能提升5.1%，首次恢复Nguyen-12，且在Feynman方程和Eureqa数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: SymMatika展示了结构感知进化搜索在科学发现中的潜力，并开源框架以促进可解释建模研究。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) seeks to recover closed-form mathematical
expressions that describe observed data. While existing methods have advanced
the discovery of either explicit mappings (i.e., $y = f(\mathbf{x})$) or
discovering implicit relations (i.e., $F(\mathbf{x}, y)=0$), few modern and
accessible frameworks support both. Moreover, most approaches treat each
expression candidate in isolation, without reusing recurring structural
patterns that could accelerate search. We introduce SymMatika, a hybrid SR
algorithm that combines multi-island genetic programming (GP) with a reusable
motif library inspired by biological sequence analysis. SymMatika identifies
high-impact substructures in top-performing candidates and reintroduces them to
guide future generations. Additionally, it incorporates a feedback-driven
evolutionary engine and supports both explicit and implicit relation discovery
using implicit-derivative metrics. Across benchmarks, SymMatika achieves
state-of-the-art recovery rates, achieving 5.1% higher performance than the
previous best results on Nguyen, the first recovery of Nguyen-12, and
competitive performance on the Feynman equations. It also recovers implicit
physical laws from Eureqa datasets up to $100\times$ faster. Our results
demonstrate the power of structure-aware evolutionary search for scientific
discovery. To support broader research in interpretable modeling and symbolic
discovery, we have open-sourced the full SymMatika framework.

Conclusion: BLaST通过减少能耗、内存占用和延迟，支持下一代大规模AI系统。

Abstract: The energy consumption of large-scale ML models is dominated by data movement
- shuffling billions of parameters across memory hierarchies and data centers.
Effective sparsification to prune redundant parameters is still challenging:
existing methods incur significant accuracy degradation, performance overhead,
or both. We introduce (Bl)ock (a)nd (S)parse (T)ransformers (BLaST), a general,
robust, and reliable sparsification method applicable to linear layers in all
settings. Our method iteratively sparsifies weight matrices into a block
sparsity pattern suitable for efficient sparse matrix-matrix (SpMM)
multiplication. BLaST achieves up to 95% sparsity in MLP weights with
negligible accuracy loss. Our fused, highly optimized Sparse MLP kernel
delivers up to 16.7x speedup over dense MLPs across 9 architectures and 8
datasets, resulting in up to 1.6x inference speedup, 1.11x pretraining speedup
and up to 3.12x inference memory usage reduction. BLaST enables the next
generation of large-scale AI systems by reducing energy use, memory footprint,
and latency.

Result: 神经网络在相同计算成本下达到与传统求解器相同的最小残余力，而增加成本后可达到更低的残余力，为力残差设定了新下限。

Conclusion: 神经网络方法不仅适用于单平衡计算，还能为连续分布的平衡提供有效模型，具有显著改进潜力。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to compute three-dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic
equilibria by parametrizing Fourier modes with artificial neural networks and
compare it to equilibria computed by conventional solvers. The full nonlinear
global force residual across the volume in real space is then minimized with
first order optimizers. Already,we observe competitive computational cost to
arrive at the same minimum residuals computed by existing codes. With increased
computational cost,lower minima of the residual are achieved by the neural
networks,establishing a new lower bound for the force residual. We use
minimally complex neural networks,and we expect significant improvements for
solving not only single equilibria with neural networks,but also for computing
neural network models valid over continuous distributions of equilibria.

Motivation: 探究LLMs在自信和怀疑之间的矛盾行为背后的机制，揭示其心理过程的非人类特性。

Method: 利用一种新实验范式，从LLMs中获取无记忆干扰的置信度估计，分析其对初始答案的固执和对矛盾反馈的敏感性。

Result: LLMs表现出强烈的选择支持偏差和对矛盾建议的过度重视，偏离了规范的贝叶斯更新。

Conclusion: LLMs的自信行为由其一致性维护机制和对矛盾反馈的异常敏感性共同驱动。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strikingly conflicting behaviors: they
can appear steadfastly overconfident in their initial answers whilst at the
same time being prone to excessive doubt when challenged. To investigate this
apparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the
unique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory
of their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We
show that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced
choice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence
in their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We
further demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to
consistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative
Bayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive
to maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to
contradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different
domain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM
confidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to
criticism.

Conclusion: 集合预测是提升领域泛化鲁棒性的有前景方向，理论框架和优化方法为此提供了支持。

Abstract: Despite the impressive advancements in modern machine learning, achieving
robustness in Domain Generalization (DG) tasks remains a significant challenge.
In DG, models are expected to perform well on samples from unseen test
distributions (also called domains), by learning from multiple related training
distributions. Most existing approaches to this problem rely on single-valued
predictions, which inherently limit their robustness. We argue that set-valued
predictors could be leveraged to enhance robustness across unseen domains,
while also taking into account that these sets should be as small as possible.
We introduce a theoretical framework defining successful set prediction in the
DG setting, focusing on meeting a predefined performance criterion across as
many domains as possible, and provide theoretical insights into the conditions
under which such domain generalization is achievable. We further propose a
practical optimization method compatible with modern learning architectures,
that balances robust performance on unseen domains with small prediction set
sizes. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets from the WILDS
benchmark, demonstrating its potential as a promising direction for robust
domain generalization.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理的扩展性受限于GPU内存，尤其是长上下文生成所需的KV缓存。现有方法存在CPU资源利用率低和精度损失的问题。

Method: HGCA结合GPU内存中的密集注意力与CPU内存中的并行稀疏注意力，采用log-sum-exp融合高效合并输出，并提出针对CPU优化的细粒度稀疏化策略。

Result: HGCA在多种模型和任务中表现出卓越的可扩展性，支持更长的序列和更大的批次，同时在性能和精度上优于现有稀疏注意力方法。

Conclusion: HGCA无需重训练即可集成到现有框架中，在普通GPU硬件上实现了高吞吐量和近全注意力质量的LLM推理。

Abstract: Scaling inference for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by limited GPU memory, especially due to growing key-value (KV)
caches required for long-context generation. While existing approaches offload
KV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they
often underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present
HGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,
high-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs
dense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and
parallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory. The
attention outputs are efficiently merged using log-sum-exp fusion, minimizing
PCIe transfer overhead. HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head
sparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual
relevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates
into existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments
across diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior
scalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms
existing sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on
commodity GPU hardware.

Result: 对比学习在三模态下表现优异，五模态时通过模态门控LSTM提升AUROC和AUPRC。

Conclusion: PiCME为模态选择和公平预测提供指导，是首个在MIMIC中全面扩展对比学习的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning holds promise for improving clinical prediction by
integrating diverse patient data, including text, imaging, time-series, and
structured demographics. Contrastive learning facilitates this integration by
producing a unified representation that can be reused across tasks, reducing
the need for separate models or encoders. Although contrastive learning has
seen success in vision-language domains, its use in clinical settings remains
largely limited to image and text pairs. We propose the Pipeline for
Contrastive Modality Evaluation and Encoding (PiCME), which systematically
assesses five clinical data types from MIMIC: discharge summaries, radiology
reports, chest X-rays, demographics, and time-series. We pre-train contrastive
models on all 26 combinations of two to five modalities and evaluate their
utility on in-hospital mortality and phenotype prediction. To address
performance plateaus with more modalities, we introduce a Modality-Gated LSTM
that weights each modality according to its contrastively learned importance.
Our results show that contrastive models remain competitive with supervised
baselines, particularly in three-modality settings. Performance declines beyond
three modalities, which supervised models fail to recover. The Modality-Gated
LSTM mitigates this drop, improving AUROC from 73.19% to 76.93% and AUPRC from
51.27% to 62.26% in the five-modality setting. We also compare contrastively
learned modality importance scores with attribution scores and evaluate
generalization across demographic subgroups, highlighting strengths in
interpretability and fairness. PiCME is the first to scale contrastive learning
across all modality combinations in MIMIC, offering guidance for modality
selection, training strategies, and equitable clinical prediction.

Motivation: 当前AI视觉系统与人类视觉存在显著差异，如过度依赖纹理特征、缺乏对形状信息的利用、鲁棒性不足等。为了解决这些问题，研究从人类视觉发展的角度出发，探索新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种人类启发的视觉学习方法（DVD），模拟人类从婴儿到成年的视觉发展过程，通过心理物理学和神经生理学的研究结果构建了一个动态的学习框架。

Result: 实验表明，通过DVD训练的AI模型在形状依赖、抽象形状识别、图像鲁棒性和对抗攻击抵抗力等方面均达到或超越了现有大参数模型的表现。

Conclusion: 研究表明，AI视觉系统的鲁棒性不仅依赖于数据量和模型规模，更可以通过优化学习方式实现，提供了一种资源高效且更接近人类视觉的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite years of research and the dramatic scaling of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems, a striking misalignment between artificial and human vision
persists. Contrary to humans, AI heavily relies on texture-features rather than
shape information, lacks robustness to image distortions, remains highly
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and struggles to recognise simple abstract
shapes within complex backgrounds. To close this gap, we here introduce a
solution that arises from a previously underexplored direction: rather than
scaling up, we take inspiration from how human vision develops from early
infancy into adulthood. We quantified the visual maturation by synthesising
decades of psychophysical and neurophysiological research into a novel
developmental visual diet (DVD) for AI vision. We show that guiding AI systems
through this human-inspired curriculum produces models that closely align with
human behaviour on every hallmark of robust vision tested yielding the
strongest reported reliance on shape information to date, abstract shape
recognition beyond the state of the art, higher robustness to image
corruptions, and stronger resilience to adversarial attacks. By outperforming
high parameter AI foundation models trained on orders of magnitude more data,
we provide evidence that robust AI vision can be achieved by guiding the way
how a model learns, not merely how much it learns, offering a
resource-efficient route toward safer and more human-like artificial visual
systems.

Conclusion: LaTF通过联合优化表示与生成，有效捕捉系统慢自由度并准确生成平衡分布，为复杂系统研究提供新工具。

Abstract: Accurate characterization of the equilibrium distributions of complex
molecular systems and their dependence on environmental factors such as
temperature is essential for understanding thermodynamic properties and
transition mechanisms. Projecting these distributions onto meaningful
low-dimensional representations enables interpretability and downstream
analysis. Recent advances in generative AI, particularly flow models such as
Normalizing Flows (NFs), have shown promise in modeling such distributions, but
their scope is limited without tailored representation learning. In this work,
we introduce Latent Thermodynamic Flows (LaTF), an end-to-end framework that
tightly integrates representation learning and generative modeling. LaTF
unifies the State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) with NFs to
simultaneously learn low-dimensional latent representations, referred to as
Collective Variables (CVs), classify metastable states, and generate
equilibrium distributions across temperatures beyond the training data. The two
components of representation learning and generative modeling are optimized
jointly, ensuring that the learned latent features capture the system's slow,
important degrees of freedom while the generative model accurately reproduces
the system's equilibrium behavior. We demonstrate LaTF's effectiveness across
diverse systems, including a model potential, the Chignolin protein, and
cluster of Lennard Jones particles, with thorough evaluations and benchmarking
using multiple metrics and extensive simulations. Finally, we apply LaTF to a
RNA tetraloop system, where despite using simulation data from only two
temperatures, LaTF reconstructs the temperature-dependent structural ensemble
and melting behavior, consistent with experimental and prior extensive
computational results.

Abstract: Transfer learning has become an essential paradigm in artificial
intelligence, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a source task to improve
performance on a target task. This approach, particularly through techniques
such as pretraining and fine-tuning, has seen significant success in fields
like computer vision and natural language processing. However, despite its
widespread use, how to reliably assess the transferability of knowledge remains
a challenge. Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of each
transferability metric is critical for ensuring the success of transfer
learning. In this survey, we provide a unified taxonomy of transferability
metrics, categorizing them based on transferable knowledge types and
measurement granularity. This work examines the various metrics developed to
evaluate the potential of source knowledge for transfer learning and their
applicability across different learning paradigms emphasizing the need for
careful selection of these metrics. By offering insights into how different
metrics work under varying conditions, this survey aims to guide researchers
and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate metric for specific
applications, contributing to more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI
systems. Finally, we discuss some open challenges in this field and propose
future research directions to further advance the application of
transferability metrics in trustworthy transfer learning.

Motivation: 解决现有零阶优化方法（如ZO2）在单设备执行和吞吐量上的局限性。

Method: 采用三种并行策略（Perturbation Parallelism、Distributed Data Parallelism和2D Parallelism）及硬件感知通信优化。

Result: 在OPT-175B上，DistZO2比ZO2快3倍。

Conclusion: DistZO2成功扩展了零阶微调的多GPU系统应用，提升效率。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to
their sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a
memory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to
multi-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute
throughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading
model parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with
dual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its
single-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we
present DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed
zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:
(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed
forward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted
to the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism
design that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication
bottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware
communication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them
across GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales
zeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory
efficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our
experiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with
distributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 动态路由模型需要基于神经元群体的信号选择架构，但现有方法缺乏对共享信号的抑制，导致模型无法有效选择专业路径。

Method: 引入神经抑制算法，抑制数据统计中共享信号，促使路由模型为每个数据样本选择更专业的路径。

Result: 实验证明神经抑制算法显著提升了通用任务的性能。

Conclusion: 神经抑制是实现混合专家、动态路由和Transformer语言模型的有效方法，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: To be effective, efficient, and diverse, deep learning models need to
dynamically choose its architecture based on signals from a population of
neurons. We hypothesize dynamic routing models can be improved with neural
inhibition in those neural populations. This means signals commonly shared
among the various modes of data statistics can be inhibited so that the routing
model can choose a specialized expert path for each data sample. Only through
inhibition is the routing mechanism able to effectively select neural pathways.
We believe this is an under-studied and under-verified implementation
methodology for Mixture-of-Experts, dynamic routing, and transformer language
models. We provide experimental evidence that the neural inhibition algorithm
significantly boosts the performance of general tasks and motivates more effort
to be invested in this research direction.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前基于信息增益的顺序查询策略（如信息追踪IP）因难以准确估计LLM的概率而表现不佳，需要一种更鲁棒的不确定性估计方法以提高查询效率和预测性能。

Method: 提出Conformal Information Pursuit (C-IP)，通过一致性预测集与条件熵的关系估计不确定性，替代传统的互信息或条件熵方法。

Result: 实验表明，C-IP在20 Questions数据集上优于传统IP和基于不确定性的思维链方法；在MediQ医疗数据集上，其表现接近单轮预测，且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: C-IP为交互式问答任务提供了一种分布无关且鲁棒的不确定性估计方法，显著提升了查询效率和预测性能。

Abstract: A significant use case of instruction-finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs)
is to solve question-answering tasks interactively. In this setting, an LLM
agent is tasked with making a prediction by sequentially querying relevant
information from the user, as opposed to a single-turn conversation. This paper
explores sequential querying strategies that aim to minimize the expected
number of queries. One such strategy is Information Pursuit (IP), a greedy
algorithm that at each iteration selects the query that maximizes information
gain or equivalently minimizes uncertainty. However, obtaining accurate
estimates of mutual information or conditional entropy for LLMs is very
difficult in practice due to over- or under-confident LLM probabilities, which
leads to suboptimal query selection and predictive performance. To better
estimate the uncertainty at each iteration, we propose Conformal Information
Pursuit (C-IP), an alternative approach to sequential information gain based on
conformal prediction sets. More specifically, C-IP leverages a relationship
between prediction sets and conditional entropy at each iteration to estimate
uncertainty based on the average size of conformal prediction sets. In contrast
to conditional entropy, we find that conformal prediction sets are a
distribution-free and robust method of measuring uncertainty. Experiments with
20 Questions show that C-IP obtains better predictive performance and shorter
query-answer chains compared to previous approaches to IP and uncertainty-based
chain-of-thought methods. Furthermore, extending to an interactive medical
setting between a doctor and a patient on the MediQ dataset, C-IP achieves
competitive performance with direct single-turn prediction while offering
greater interpretability.

Result: LRTM成功重建了缺失值，尤其在云遮挡和热点识别方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 张量填补方法在时空尺度扩展下有效，适用于动态大气变量的数据重建。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate for the first time the low-rank properties of a
tensorized large-scale spatio-temporal dynamic atmospheric variable. We focus
on the Sentinel-5P tropospheric NO2 product (S5P-TN) over a four-year period in
an area that encompasses the contiguous United States (CONUS). Here, it is
demonstrated that a low-rank approximation of such a dynamic variable is
feasible. We apply the low-rank properties of the S5P-TN data to inpaint gaps
in the Sentinel-5P product by adopting a low-rank tensor model (LRTM) based on
the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and alternating least squares (ALS).
Furthermore, we evaluate the LRTM's results by comparing them with spatial
interpolation using geostatistics, and conduct a comprehensive spatial
statistical and temporal analysis of the S5P-TN product. The results of this
study demonstrated that the tensor completion successfully reconstructs the
missing values in the S5P-TN product, particularly in the presence of extended
cloud obscuration, predicting outliers and identifying hotspots, when the data
is tensorized over extended spatial and temporal scales.

Conclusion: GVI-DA 在理论和实践上均具有优势，尤其在前连续性、码本大小和伪标签噪声容忍度的分析中展现了其理论严谨性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based domain adaptation (DA) methods have shown strong
performance by learning transferable representations. However, their reliance
on mini-batch training limits global distribution modeling, leading to unstable
alignment and suboptimal generalization. We propose Global Variational
Inference Enhanced Domain Adaptation (GVI-DA), a framework that learns
continuous, class-conditional global priors via variational inference to enable
structure-aware cross-domain alignment. GVI-DA minimizes domain gaps through
latent feature reconstruction, and mitigates posterior collapse using global
codebook learning with randomized sampling. It further improves robustness by
discarding low-confidence pseudo-labels and generating reliable target-domain
samples. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and thirty-eight DA tasks
demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance. We also derive the model's
evidence lower bound (ELBO) and analyze the effects of prior continuity,
codebook size, and pseudo-label noise tolerance. In addition, we compare GVI-DA
with diffusion-based generative frameworks in terms of optimization principles
and efficiency, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and practical
advantages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前低秩近似压缩方法通常对所有权重矩阵使用统一的压缩比例，忽略了其对模型性能的差异化影响。传统启发式搜索策略计算效率低且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 提出MGAA方法，包括两部分：1) 基于子层输入输出的余弦相似度分配压缩比例；2) 根据权重矩阵能量分布特性分配压缩比例。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和基准数据集上的实验表明MGAA性能优越，并在多模态模型LLaVA上实现了显著性能提升。

Conclusion: MGAA能够自适应分配参数，提高压缩效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: The enormous parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) has made model
compression a research hotspot, which aims to alleviate computational resource
demands during deployment and inference. As a promising direction, low-rank
approximation technique has made remarkable achievements. Nevertheless,
unfortunately, the vast majority of studies to low-rank approximation
compression generally apply uniform compression ratios across all weight
matrices, while disregarding their inherently differentiated impacts on the
model's performance. Although a few recent work attempts to employ heuristic
search strategies to achieve the optimal parameter allocation, such strategies
are computationally inefficient and lose the generalization ability in the era
of LLMs. In this study, we propose a novel parameter Multi-Granular Adaptive
Allocation (MGAA) method, which can adaptively allocate parameters between and
within sublayers without task-specific evaluations in the compression process.
MGAA consists of two components: 1) Among different sublayers, it assigns
compression ratios based on their cosine similarity between inputs and outputs,
allowing for a more tailored compression in sublayers with varying degrees of
importance, and 2) Within each sublayer, it allocates different compression
ratios to weight matrices based on their energy distribution characteristics,
ensuring a consistent energy retention ratio while optimizing compression
efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations of MGAA across multiple LLMs backbone
models and benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior performance.
Additionally, we apply our MGAA to multimodal model LLaVA, exhibiting
remarkable performance improvements.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，对象间的交互是动态核心，但现有对象中心世界模型主要在简单视觉环境测试，缺乏对多样化纹理和杂乱场景的泛化研究。

Method: 引入Dyn-O，通过对象中心表示改进动态建模和学习表示，并将对象特征分解为动态无关和动态感知组件。

Conclusion: Dyn-O在复杂环境中表现出色，提升了对象中心世界模型的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: World models aim to capture the dynamics of the environment, enabling agents
to predict and plan for future states. In most scenarios of interest, the
dynamics are highly centered on interactions among objects within the
environment. This motivates the development of world models that operate on
object-centric rather than monolithic representations, with the goal of more
effectively capturing environment dynamics and enhancing compositional
generalization. However, the development of object-centric world models has
largely been explored in environments with limited visual complexity (such as
basic geometries). It remains underexplored whether such models can generalize
to more complex settings with diverse textures and cluttered scenes. In this
paper, we fill this gap by introducing Dyn-O, an enhanced structured world
model built upon object-centric representations. Compared to prior work in
object-centric representations, Dyn-O improves in both learning representations
and modeling dynamics. On the challenging Procgen games, we find that our
method can learn object-centric world models directly from pixel observations,
outperforming DreamerV3 in rollout prediction accuracy. Furthermore, by
decoupling object-centric features into dynamics-agnostic and dynamics-aware
components, we enable finer-grained manipulation of these features and generate
more diverse imagined trajectories.

Abstract: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) are central to combinatorial optimization
with significant practical implications. Recent advancements in neural
combinatorial optimization (NCO) have demonstrated promising results by
leveraging neural networks to solve VRPs, yet the exploration of model scaling

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，ReTimeCausal在不规则采样和缺失数据条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReTimeCausal为解决复杂时间序列因果发现提供了有效的可解释框架。

Abstract: This paper studies causal discovery in irregularly sampled time series-a
pivotal challenge in high-stakes domains like finance, healthcare, and climate
science, where missing data and inconsistent sampling frequencies distort
causal mechanisms. Traditional methods (e.g., Granger causality, PCMCI) fail to
reconcile multi-scale interactions (e.g., hourly storms vs. decadal climate
shifts), while neural approaches (e.g., CUTS+) lack interpretability, stemming
from a critical gap: existing frameworks either rigidly assume temporal
regularity or aggregate dynamics into opaque representations, neglecting
real-world granularity and auditable logic. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReTimeCausal, a novel integration of Additive Noise Models (ANM) and
Expectation-Maximization (EM) that unifies physics-guided data imputation with
sparse causal inference. Through kernelized sparse regression and structural
constraints, ReTimeCausal iteratively refines missing values (E-step) and
causal graphs (M-step), resolving cross-frequency dependencies and missing data
issues. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that ReTimeCausal outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under
challenging irregular sampling and missing data conditions.

Abstract: Mixed-precision training has emerged as an indispensable tool for enhancing
the efficiency of neural network training in recent years. Concurrently, JAX
has grown in popularity as a versatile machine learning toolbox. However, it
currently lacks robust support for mixed-precision training. We propose MPX, a
mixed-precision training toolbox for JAX that simplifies and accelerates the
training of large-scale neural networks while preserving model accuracy. MPX
seamlessly integrates with popular toolboxes such as Equinox and Flax, allowing
users to convert full-precision pipelines to mixed-precision versions with
minimal modifications. By casting both inputs and outputs to half precision,
and introducing a dynamic loss-scaling mechanism, MPX alleviates issues like
gradient underflow and overflow that commonly arise in half precision
computations. Its design inherits critical features from JAX's type-promotion
behavior, ensuring that operations take place in the correct precision and
allowing for selective enforcement of full precision where needed (e.g., sums,
means, or softmax). MPX further provides wrappers for automatic creation and
management of mixed-precision gradients and optimizers, enabling
straightforward integration into existing JAX training pipelines. MPX's source

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches have been increasingly
applied in drug discovery to learn molecular representations and identify
substructures driving property predictions. However, building end-to-end
explainable machine learning models for structure-activity relationship (SAR)
modeling for compound property prediction faces many challenges, such as
limited activity data per target and the sensitivity of properties to subtle
molecular changes. To address this, we leveraged activity-cliff molecule pairs,
i.e., compounds sharing a common scaffold but differing sharply in potency,
targeting three proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src proteins (i.e., PDB
IDs 1O42, 2H8H, and 4MXO). We implemented graph neural network (GNN) methods to
obtain atom-level feature information and predict compound-protein affinity
(i.e., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50). In addition, we trained
GNN models with different structure-aware loss functions to adequately leverage
molecular property and structure information. We also utilized group lasso and
sparse group lasso to prune and highlight molecular subgraphs and enhance the
structure-specific model explainability for the predicted property difference
in molecular activity-cliff pairs. We improved drug property prediction by
integrating common and uncommon node information and using sparse group lasso,
reducing the average root mean squared error (RMSE) by 12.70%, and achieving
the lowest averaged RMSE=0.2551 and the highest PCC=0.9572. Furthermore,
applying regularization enhances feature attribution methods that estimate the
contribution of each atom in the molecular graphs by boosting global direction
scores and atom-level accuracy in atom coloring accuracy, which improves model
interpretability in drug discovery pipelines, particularly in investigating
important molecular substructures in lead optimization.

Abstract: Linear attention has attracted interest as a computationally efficient
approximation to softmax attention, especially for long sequences. Recent
studies have explored distilling softmax attention in pre-trained Transformers
into linear attention. However, a critical challenge remains: how to choose the
feature dimension that governs the approximation quality. Existing methods fix
this dimension uniformly across all attention layers, overlooking the diverse
roles and complexities of them. In this paper, we propose a principled method
to automatically determine the feature dimension in linear attention using the
concept of statistical degrees of freedom, which represent the effective
dimensionality of the inputs. We provide a theoretical bound on the
approximation error and show that the dimension chosen by our method achieves
smaller error under a fixed computational budget. Furthermore, we introduce an
efficient layerwise training strategy to learn nonlinear features tailored to
each layer. Experiments on multiple pre-trained transformers demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of distilled models compared to baselines
without increasing the inference cost. Our findings also provide insight into
how the complexity of the attention mechanism evolves across layers.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in sequential
decision tasks. However, recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of RL
policies to different perturbations, raising concerns about their effectiveness
and safety in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on the robustness
of RL policies against action perturbations and introduce a novel framework
called Optimal Adversary-aware Policy Iteration (OA-PI). Our framework enhances
action robustness under various perturbations by evaluating and improving
policy performance against the corresponding optimal adversaries. Besides, our
approach can be integrated into mainstream DRL algorithms such as Twin Delayed
DDPG (TD3) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), improving action robustness
effectively while maintaining nominal performance and sample efficiency.
Experimental results across various environments demonstrate that our method
enhances robustness of DRL policies against different action adversaries
effectively.

Abstract: Machine Learning is a diverse field applied across various domains such as
computer science, social sciences, medicine, chemistry, and finance. This
diversity results in varied evaluation approaches, making it difficult to
compare models effectively. Absolute evaluation measures offer a practical
solution by assessing a model's performance on a fixed scale, independent of
reference models and data ranges, enabling explicit comparisons. However, many
commonly used measures are not universally applicable, leading to a lack of
comprehensive guidance on their appropriate use. This survey addresses this gap
by providing an overview of absolute evaluation metrics in ML, organized by the
type of learning problem. While classification metrics have been extensively
studied, this work also covers clustering, regression, and ranking metrics. By
grouping these measures according to the specific ML challenges they address,
this survey aims to equip practitioners with the tools necessary to select
appropriate metrics for their models. The provided overview thus improves
individual model evaluation and facilitates meaningful comparisons across
different models and applications.

Result: 证明了$z$-变换方法在描述收敛行为方面的有效性，特别是通过谱维度表征收敛行为。

Conclusion: $z$-变换方法在优化算法中具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become
indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper
addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear
hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different
contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations
(pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China
(post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data
and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion
leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in
tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT),
ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked
Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to
generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust
under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to
broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain
management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation
are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency
analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how
large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making
processes.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is essential in drug discovery and
related fields. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle
to simultaneously capture both local and global molecular structures. In this
work, we propose a Multi-Level Fusion Graph Neural Network (MLFGNN) that
integrates Graph Attention Networks and a novel Graph Transformer to jointly
model local and global dependencies. In addition, we incorporate molecular
fingerprints as a complementary modality and introduce a mechanism of
interaction between attention to adaptively fuse information across
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MLFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both classification and regression tasks. Interpretability analysis further
reveals that the model effectively captures task-relevant chemical patterns,
supporting the usefulness of multi-level and multi-modal fusion in molecular
representation learning.

Abstract: The shape of a molecule determines its physicochemical and biological
properties. However, it is often underrepresented in standard molecular
representation learning approaches. Here, we propose using the Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) as a geometrical-topological descriptor.
Computed directly on a molecular graph derived from handcrafted atomic
features, the ECT enables the extraction of multiscale structural features,
offering a novel way to represent and encode molecular shape in the feature
space. We assess the predictive performance of this representation across nine
benchmark regression datasets, all centered around predicting the inhibition
constant $K_i$. In addition, we compare our proposed ECT-based representation
against traditional molecular representations and methods, such as molecular
fingerprints/descriptors and graph neural networks (GNNs). Our results show
that our ECT-based representation achieves competitive performance, ranking
among the best-performing methods on several datasets. More importantly, its
combination with traditional representations, particularly with the AVALON
fingerprint, significantly \emph{enhances predictive performance},
outperforming other methods on most datasets. These findings highlight the
complementary value of multiscale topological information and its potential for
being combined with established techniques. Our study suggests that hybrid
approaches incorporating explicit shape information can lead to more
informative and robust molecular representations, enhancing and opening new
avenues in molecular machine learning tasks. To support reproducibility and
foster open biomedical research, we provide open access to all experiments and
code used in this work.

Abstract: ObjectRL is an open-source Python codebase for deep reinforcement learning
(RL), designed for research-oriented prototyping with minimal programming
effort. Unlike existing codebases, ObjectRL is built on Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) principles, providing a clear structure that simplifies the
implementation, modification, and evaluation of new algorithms. ObjectRL lowers
the entry barrier for deep RL research by organizing best practices into
explicit, clearly separated components, making them easier to understand and
adapt. Each algorithmic component is a class with attributes that describe key
RL concepts and methods that intuitively reflect their interactions. The class
hierarchy closely follows common ontological relationships, enabling data
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are core features of OOP.
We demonstrate the efficiency of ObjectRL's design through representative use
cases that highlight its flexibility and suitability for rapid prototyping. The

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 动机：科学数据的特征生成需要领域专家知识且搜索空间巨大，传统方法效率低下，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Result: 结果：MAFG框架显著提升了科学数据挖掘任务的效果，实现了特征生成的自动化。

Conclusion: 结论：MAFG框架有效解决了特征生成的自动化问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Feature generation (FG) aims to enhance the prediction potential of original
data by constructing high-order feature combinations and removing redundant
features. It is a key preprocessing step for tabular scientific data to improve
downstream machine-learning model performance. Traditional methods face the
following two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific
data: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in
scientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.
Secondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space
expands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.
Advancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have
opened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by
that, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and
proposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in
the iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical
transformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature
combinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement
learning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration
phase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively
evaluate the generated features of each significant model performance
breakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate
that the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process
and significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.

Conclusion: RLRS是一种简单有效的优化大规模神经网络训练的方法，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for optimizing LLM training by
adjusting learning rates across weights of different components in Transformer
models. Traditional methods often apply a uniform learning rate across all
network layers, potentially overlooking the unique dynamics of each part.
Remarkably, our introduced relative learning rates, RLRS, method accelerates
the training process by up to $23\%$, particularly in complex models such as
Mixture of Experts (MoE). Hyperparameters of RLRS can be efficiently tuned on
smaller models and then effectively reused on models up to $27\times$ larger.
This simple and effective method results in a substantial reduction in training
time and computational resources, offering a practical and scalable solution
for optimizing large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has received increasing attention in recent
years, particularly with the emergence of foundation models for tabular data.
The breakthrough success of TabPFN (Hollmann et al.,2025), which leverages vast
quantities of synthetic tabular datasets derived from structural causal models
(SCMs), demonstrates the critical role synthetic data plays in developing
powerful tabular foundation models. However, most real-world tabular data
exists in relational formats spanning multiple interconnected tables - a
structure not adequately addressed by current generation methods. In this work,
we extend the SCM-based approach by developing a novel framework that generates
realistic synthetic relational tabular data including causal relationships
across tables. Our experiments confirm that this framework is able to construct
relational datasets with complex inter-table dependencies mimicking real-world
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 联邦学习中的差分隐私导致高维梯度传输和大规模噪声问题，而实际梯度更新具有时间相关性且存在于低维子空间，因此需要一种高效方法来降低通信和噪声成本。

Method: 提出DOME框架，客户端维护紧凑的投影草图，将梯度降维至ℝᵏ后进行隐私化和安全聚合，并通过正交随机探针防止投影空间退化。

Result: 将每轮通信从O(d)降至O(k)，梯度近似均方误差趋近σ²k，同时满足(ε,δ)-差分隐私。

Conclusion: DOME通过投影和正交探针技术，显著降低了联邦学习中差分隐私的通信和噪声开销，同时保持隐私保护效果。

Abstract: Federated learning with differential privacy suffers from two major costs:
each client must transmit $d$-dimensional gradients every round, and the
magnitude of DP noise grows with $d$. Yet empirical studies show that gradient
updates exhibit strong temporal correlations and lie in a $k$-dimensional
subspace with $k \ll d$. Motivated by this, we introduce DOME, a decentralized
DP optimization framework in which each client maintains a compact sketch to
project gradients into $\mathbb{R}^k$ before privatization and Secure
Aggregation. This reduces per-round communication from order $d$ to order $k$
and moves towards a gradient approximation mean-squared error of $\sigma^2 k$.
To allow the sketch to span new directions and prevent it from collapsing onto
historical gradients, we augment it with random probes orthogonal to historical
directions. We prove that our overall protocol satisfies
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-Differential Privacy.

Abstract: The Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) successfully bridges the gap between
kernel methods and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), addressing key challenges such
as the difficulty of training deep networks and the limitations of traditional
kernel methods. However, the existing layer-stacking strategy in GNTK
introduces redundant computations, significantly increasing computational
complexity and limiting scalability for practical applications. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the Simplified Graph Neural Tangent Kernel
(SGTK), which replaces the traditional multi-layer stacking mechanism with a
continuous $K$-step aggregation operation. This novel approach streamlines the
iterative kernel computation process, effectively eliminating redundant
calculations while preserving the kernel's expressiveness. By reducing the
dependency on layer stacking, SGTK achieves both computational simplicity and
efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce the Simplified Graph Neural Kernel
(SGNK), which models infinitely wide Graph Neural Networks as Gaussian
Processes. This allows kernel values to be directly determined from the
expected outputs of activation functions in the infinite-width regime,
bypassing the need for explicit layer-by-layer computation. SGNK further
reduces computational complexity while maintaining the capacity to capture
intricate structural patterns in graphs. Extensive experiments on node and
graph classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed SGTK and SGNK achieve
performance comparable to existing approaches while improving computational
efficiency. Implementation details are available at

Conclusion: KLDM通过创新性的坐标建模方法，为结晶材料的生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative modeling of crystalline materials using diffusion models presents
a series of challenges: the data distribution is characterized by inherent
symmetries and involves multiple modalities, with some defined on specific
manifolds. Notably, the treatment of fractional coordinates representing atomic
positions in the unit cell requires careful consideration, as they lie on a
hypertorus. In this work, we introduce Kinetic Langevin Diffusion for Materials
(KLDM), a novel diffusion model for crystalline materials generation, where the
key innovation resides in the modeling of the coordinates. Instead of resorting
to Riemannian diffusion on the hypertorus directly, we generalize Trivialized
Diffusion Model (TDM) to account for the symmetries inherent to crystals. By
coupling coordinates with auxiliary Euclidean variables representing
velocities, the diffusion process is now offset to a flat space. This allows us
to effectively perform diffusion on the hypertorus while providing a training
objective that accounts for the periodic translation symmetry of the true data
distribution. We evaluate KLDM on both Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and
De-novo Generation (DNG) tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance with
current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Accurate individual treatment-effect estimation in high-stakes applications
demands both reliable point predictions and interpretable uncertainty
quantification. We propose a factorized Monte Carlo Dropout framework for deep
twin-network models that splits total predictive variance into representation
uncertainty (sigma_rep) in the shared encoder and prediction uncertainty
(sigma_pred) in the outcome heads. Across three synthetic covariate-shift
regimes, our intervals are well-calibrated (ECE < 0.03) and satisfy sigma_rep^2
+ sigma_pred^2 ~ sigma_tot^2. Additionally, we observe a crossover: head
uncertainty leads on in-distribution data, but representation uncertainty
dominates under shift. Finally, on a real-world twins cohort with induced
multivariate shifts, only sigma_rep spikes on out-of-distribution samples
(delta sigma ~ 0.0002) and becomes the primary error predictor (rho_rep <=
0.89), while sigma_pred remains flat. This module-level decomposition offers a
practical diagnostic for detecting and interpreting uncertainty sources in deep
causal-effect models.

Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and

Method: MLASDO基于支持向量机算法，通过三步流程（分类、检测、解释）识别和描述组学数据中的异常样本。

Conclusion: MLASDO是一个强大的工具，可帮助临床医生检测和解释异常样本，支持后续研究。

Abstract: Inconsistencies between clinical and omics data may arise within medical
cohorts. The identification, annotation and explanation of anomalous
omics-based patients or individuals may become crucial to better reshape the
disease, e.g., by detecting early onsets signaled by the omics and undetectable
from observable symptoms. Here, we developed MLASDO (Machine Learning based
Anomalous Sample Detection on Omics), a new method and software tool to
identify, characterize and automatically describe anomalous samples based on
omics data. Its workflow is based on three steps: (1) classification of healthy
and cases individuals using a support vector machine algorithm; (2) detection
of anomalous samples within groups; (3) explanation of anomalous individuals
based on clinical data and expert knowledge. We showcase MLASDO using
transcriptomics data of 317 healthy controls (HC) and 465 Parkinson's disease
(PD) cases from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. In this cohort,
MLASDO detected 15 anomalous HC with a PD-like transcriptomic signature and
PD-like clinical features, including a lower proportion of CD4/CD8 naive
T-cells and CD4 memory T-cells compared to HC (P<3.5*10^-3). MLASDO also
identified 22 anomalous PD cases with a transcriptomic signature more similar
to that of HC and some clinical features more similar to HC, including a lower
proportion of mature neutrophils compared to PD cases (P<6*10^-3). In summary,
MLASDO is a powerful tool that can help the clinician to detect and explain
anomalous HC and cases of interest to be followed up. MLASDO is an open-source
R package available at: https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/MLASDO.

Motivation: 解决多物理场强耦合系统中的实时代理模型需求，填补神经算子在多物理场问题中应用的研究空白。

Abstract: Scientific applications increasingly demand real-time surrogate models that
can capture the behavior of strongly coupled multiphysics systems driven by
multiple input functions, such as in thermo-mechanical and electro-thermal
processes. While neural operator frameworks, such as Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets), have shown considerable success in single-physics settings, their
extension to multiphysics problems remains poorly understood. In particular,
the challenge of learning nonlinear interactions between tightly coupled
physical fields has received little systematic attention. This study addresses
a foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator
reflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we
present the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet
variants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly
coupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with
dual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional
coupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic
thermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient
phase-driven interactions. Two operator-learning frameworks, the classical
DeepONet and its sequential GRU-based extension, S-DeepONet, are benchmarked
using both single-branch and multi-branch (MIONet-style) architectures. Our
results demonstrate that architectural alignment with physical coupling is
crucial: single-branch networks significantly outperform multi-branch
counterparts in strongly coupled settings, whereas multi-branch encodings offer
advantages for decoupled or single-physics problems. Once trained, these
surrogates achieve full-field predictions up to 1.8e4 times faster than
high-fidelity finite-element solvers, without compromising solution accuracy.

Motivation: 研究目的是为了理解在特定领域微调LLMs时，为何会引发广泛的行为失准，从而为更鲁棒的微调策略提供理论基础。

Method: 通过一系列实验，包括输出概率分布、损失和梯度向量几何、逐层激活动态以及激活空间维度分析，研究了微调对LLMs内部机制的影响。

Result: 研究发现，微调不安全代码会引发与对齐性相悖的内部变化，并识别出一个共享潜在维度，该维度在模型激活空间中对对齐行为起到关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了微调对LLMs对齐性的脆弱性，并强调了开发能够跨领域保持预期行为的鲁棒微调策略的必要性。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on code
with security vulnerabilities can result in misaligned and unsafe behaviors
across broad domains. These results prompted concerns about the emergence of
harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we
contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts
the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series
of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient
vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space
dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be
better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning
on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we
identify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs
alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and
by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can
degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.
Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed
misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The
results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that
preserve intended behavior across domains.

Motivation: 准确的电力消耗预测对电网稳定和发电优化至关重要，传统方法如GAMs难以捕捉空间依赖性，GNNs提供了解决方案。

Method: 研究评估了多种GNN架构（如GCN、GraphSAGE、GAT等）在法国和英国的实际电力消耗数据集上的表现，并分析了注意机制和集成策略。

Conclusion: 注意机制虽非万能，但在空间依赖性强时具有解释优势，集成策略能提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate electricity consumption forecasting is crucial for ensuring grid
stability and optimizing power generation, particularly in increasingly
decentralized and complex systems. While classical approaches such as
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail to
capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by
directly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of
GNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,
TransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two
real-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our
experiments show that while complex architectures like GATv2 and
TransformerConv do not consistently outperform their simpler counterparts,
models such as GCN and APPNP achieve strong results in low-data or highly
disaggregated settings. Nonetheless, the vanilla GAT remains highly competitive
across both datasets and offers an additional interpretability layer via
attention mechanisms. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,
revealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and
meteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is
not universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial
dependencies are prominent. Finally, we benchmark ensemble-based expert
aggregation strategies, showing that uniform or learned combinations can
enhance robustness and outperform individual models under data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决天使投资人决策的主观性和耗时问题，同时克服CFA工具因人力需求高而难以广泛使用的限制。

Method: 使用大型语言模型(LLMs)为600个初创企业路演转录文本生成CFA分数，并以此训练机器学习分类模型。

Result: 最优模型预测准确率达85.0%，与传统人工评分显著相关（Spearman's r = 0.896）。

Conclusion: AI结合CFA框架可提供可扩展、可靠且低偏见的初创企业评估工具。

Abstract: External funding is crucial for early-stage ventures, particularly technology
startups that require significant R&D investment. Business angels offer a
critical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and
resource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has
investigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels
consider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more
than 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated
post-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own
decisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals
and several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work
validating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its
adoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we
prompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors
to a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business
angel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated
machine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as
input features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy
(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant
correlation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional
human-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a
structured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,
reliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the
constraints that previously limited adoption.

Conclusion: FAROS是一种高效且有效的框架，能够在生成图数据时直接优化公平性，无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph diffusion models (GDMs) have enabled the
synthesis of realistic network structures, yet ensuring fairness in the
generated data remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions attempt to
mitigate bias by re-training the GDMs with ad-hoc fairness constraints.
Conversely, with this work, we propose FAROS, a novel FAir graph geneRatiOn
framework leveraging attribute Switching mechanisms and directly running in the
generation process of the pre-trained GDM. Technically, our approach works by
altering nodes' sensitive attributes during the generation. To this end, FAROS
calculates the optimal fraction of switching nodes, and selects the diffusion
step to perform the switch by setting tailored multi-criteria constraints to
preserve the node-topology profile from the original distribution (a proxy for
accuracy) while ensuring the edge independence on the sensitive attributes for
the generated graph (a proxy for fairness). Our experiments on benchmark
datasets for link prediction demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively
reduces fairness discrepancies while maintaining comparable (or even higher)
accuracy performance to other similar baselines. Noteworthy, FAROS is also able
to strike a better accuracy-fairness trade-off than other competitors in some
of the tested settings under the Pareto optimality concept, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the imposed multi-criteria constraints.

Conclusion: 该统计框架为LLM评估提供了更可靠和可解释的自动评分器使用方法，支持性能分析和偏见检测。

Abstract: The evaluation of large language model (LLM) outputs is increasingly
performed by other LLMs, a setup commonly known as "LLM-as-a-judge", or
autograders. While autograders offer a scalable alternative to human
evaluation, they have shown mixed reliability and may exhibit systematic
biases, depending on response type, scoring methodology, domain specificity,
and other factors. In this paper we propose a statistical framework based on
Bayesian generalised linear models (GLMs) that enables researchers to
simultaneously assess their autograders while also addressing their primary
research questions (e.g., LLM evaluation). Our approach models evaluation
outcomes (e.g., scores or pairwise preferences) as a function of properties of
the grader (e.g., human vs. autograder) and the evaluated item (e.g., response
length or the LLM that generated it), allowing for explicit quantification of
scoring differences and potential biases within a unified framework. In
addition, our method can be used to augment traditional reliability metrics
such as inter-rater agreement, by providing uncertainty estimates and
clarifying the source of disagreement. Overall, this approach contributes to
more robust and interpretable use of autograders in LLM evaluation, enabling
both performance analysis and bias detection.

Conclusion: GNN-Ceff为VLSI设计提供了一种高效且准确的有效电容建模方法，显著提升了设计流程的效率。

Abstract: Static timing analysis is a crucial stage in the VLSI design flow that
verifies the timing correctness of circuits. Timing analysis depends on the
placement and routing of the design, but at the same time, placement and
routing efficiency depend on the final timing performance. VLSI design flows
can benefit from timing-related prediction to better perform the earlier stages
of the design flow. Effective capacitance is an essential input for gate delay
calculation, and finding exact values requires routing or routing estimates. In
this work, we propose the first GNN-based post-layout effective capacitance
modeling method, GNN-Ceff, that achieves significant speed gains due to GPU
parallelization while also providing better accuracy than current heuristics.
GNN-Ceff parallelization achieves 929x speedup on real-life benchmarks over the
state-of-the-art method run serially.

Motivation: 大型语言模型因尺寸难以部署于资源受限环境，现有压缩方法假设权重低秩但不符合实际，需转向激活重建优化。

Method: IMPACT框架结合激活结构和梯度敏感性，通过重要性加权激活协方差矩阵的特征向量进行最优重建。

Result: 实验表明，IMPACT在多种模型和任务中将模型大小减少多达48.6%，同时保持与基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: IMPACT提供了一种原则性方法，通过重要性感知激活重建有效压缩模型，提升部署效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains
but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size.
Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model
size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption
that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in
LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a
shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions
contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm
performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware
activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their
impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that
considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a
closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the
eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This
enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.
Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to
48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: 生成的算法在相同分布的矩阵上具有可证明的泛化能力，并在数值实验中优于文献中的基准方法。

Conclusion: MatRL能自动优化迭代算法，显著提升计算矩阵函数的性能。

Abstract: Iterative methods for computing matrix functions have been extensively
studied and their convergence speed can be significantly improved with the
right tuning of parameters and by mixing different iteration types. Handtuning
the design options for optimal performance can be cumbersome, especially in
modern computing environments: numerous different classical iterations and
their variants exist, each with non-trivial per-step cost and tuning
parameters. To this end, we propose MatRL -- a reinforcement learning based
framework that automatically discovers iterative algorithms for computing
matrix functions. The key idea is to treat algorithm design as a sequential
decision-making process. Monte-Carlo tree search is then used to plan a hybrid
sequence of matrix iterations and step sizes, tailored to a specific input
matrix distribution and computing environment. Moreover, we also show that the
learned algorithms provably generalize to sufficiently large matrices drawn
from the same distribution. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical results
with numerical experiments demonstrating that MatRL produces algorithms that
outperform various baselines in the literature.

Conclusion: 分布式eGNN为大规模电子结构预测提供高效解决方案，突破GPU内存限制。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (eGNNs) trained on density-functional
theory (DFT) data can potentially perform electronic structure prediction at
unprecedented scales, enabling investigation of the electronic properties of
materials with extended defects, interfaces, or exhibiting disordered phases.
However, as interactions between atomic orbitals typically extend over 10+
angstroms, the graph representations required for this task tend to be densely
connected, and the memory requirements to perform training and inference on
these large structures can exceed the limits of modern GPUs. Here we present a
distributed eGNN implementation which leverages direct GPU communication and
introduce a partitioning strategy of the input graph to reduce the number of
embedding exchanges between GPUs. Our implementation shows strong scaling up to
128 GPUs, and weak scaling up to 512 GPUs with 87% parallel efficiency for
structures with 3,000 to 190,000 atoms on the Alps supercomputer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在医疗成本模型中，高维度的ICD-10代码可能导致OLS模型的系数不稳定，而传统的正则化方法可能丢失重要预测变量，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过截断ICD-10代码（从7字符减少到6字符或更少），降低回归问题的维度，同时保留所有诊断类别的表征。数学上，这种合并预测变量的方法增加了Hessian矩阵的迹，从而减少系数估计的方差。

Result: 截断ICD-10代码有效地平衡了模型的可解释性、准确性和一致性，解释了为什么现实中的风险调整和成本模型更倾向于使用较宽泛的诊断分组（如DRGs和HCC代码）。

Conclusion: 降低ICD-10代码的细粒度是一种有效的正则化策略，可以用于提升OLS模型的性能，为医疗成本建模提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy,
and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to
achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for
high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable
regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic
codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are
infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge
can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we
demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective
regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all
diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters
(e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the
dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model
interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in
OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance
of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic
groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes
in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate hallucinations: statements
that are syntactically plausible but lack factual grounding. This research
presents KEA (Kernel-Enriched AI) Explain: a neurosymbolic framework that
detects and explains such hallucinations by comparing knowledge graphs
constructed from LLM outputs with ground truth data from Wikidata or contextual
documents. Using graph kernels and semantic clustering, the method provides
explanations for detected hallucinations, ensuring both robustness and
interpretability. Our framework achieves competitive accuracy in detecting
hallucinations across both open- and closed-domain tasks, and is able to
generate contrastive explanations, enhancing transparency. This research
advances the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains and provides a
foundation for future work on precision improvements and multi-source knowledge
integration.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法大多局限于中性、闭壳层分子，无法处理真实世界中复杂的电荷、自旋和环境效应。

Method: OrbitAll结合自旋极化轨道特征与SE(3)-等变图神经网络，构建了一种几何和物理信息驱动的深度学习框架。

Result: OrbitAll在带电、开壳层和溶剂化分子的预测中表现出色，且能泛化到远大于训练数据的分子，同时比DFT快10^3-10^4倍。

Conclusion: OrbitAll是一种高效、通用的量子化学表示方法，显著提升了复杂分子系统的建模能力。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning methods in quantum chemistry, their
representational capacity is most often confined to neutral, closed-shell
molecules. However, real-world chemical systems often exhibit complex
characteristics, including varying charges, spins, and environments. We
introduce OrbitAll, a geometry- and physics-informed deep learning framework
that can represent all molecular systems with electronic structure information.
OrbitAll utilizes spin-polarized orbital features from the underlying quantum
mechanical method, and combines it with graph neural networks satisfying
SE(3)-equivariance. The resulting framework can represent and process any
molecular system with arbitrary charges, spins, and environmental effects.
OrbitAll demonstrates superior performance and generalization on predicting
charged, open-shell, and solvated molecules, while also robustly extrapolating
to molecules significantly larger than the training data by leveraging a
physics-informed architecture. OrbitAll achieves chemical accuracy using 10
times fewer training data than competing AI models, with a speedup of
approximately $10^3$ - $10^4$ compared to density functional theory.

### [241] [Latent FxLMS: Accelerating Active Noise Control with Neural Adaptive Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03854)

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统FxLMS在主动噪声控制（ANC）中虽广泛应用，但缺乏对噪声源空间区域先验知识的利用。通过利用低维流形约束滤波权重，有望提升性能。

Method: 训练自编码器对稳态自适应滤波器系数进行编码和解码，在潜在空间更新权重，并通过解码器生成消除滤波器。研究了神经网络约束和归一化技术的影响。

Result: 在特定条件下，隐式FxLMS比标准FxLMS收敛更快，稳态均方误差相当。

Conclusion: 利用低维流形约束的自编码器方法能有效优化FxLMS性能，尤其在收敛速度方面表现突出。

Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC),
wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior
knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could
improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible
adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of
the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from
a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be
the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we
perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the
cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and
normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean
squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in
fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决不规则几何域上复杂空间相关性和非线性时间动态的联合建模问题。

Result: TK-GCN 在心脏动力学预测任务中表现优异，预测精度高。

Conclusion: TK-GCN 能有效建模复杂空间结构和非线性时间动态。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal dynamics forecasting is inherently challenging, particularly
in systems defined over irregular geometric domains, due to the need to jointly
capture complex spatial correlations and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To tackle
these challenges, we propose TK-GCN, a two-stage framework that integrates
geometry-aware spatial encoding with long-range temporal modeling. In the first
stage, a Koopman-enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (K-GCN) is developed to
embed the high-dimensional dynamics distributed on spatially irregular domains
into a latent space where the evolution of system states is approximately
linear. By leveraging Koopman operator theory, this stage enhances the temporal
consistency during the latent learning. In the second stage, a Transformer
module is employed to model the temporal progression within the Koopman-encoded
latent space. Through the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer captures
long-range temporal dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting over extended
horizons. We evaluate TK-GCN in spatiotemporal cardiac dynamics forecasting and
benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results and ablation studies show that TK-GCN consistently
delivers superior predictive accuracy across a range of forecast horizons,
demonstrating its capability to effectively model complex spatial structures
and nonlinear temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: 所提出的高阶PINN方法在ODE求解中表现优异，且有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning neural network models for Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) with parametric uncertainties. Such neural
network models capture the solution to the ODE over a given set of parameters,
initial conditions, and range of times. Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for learning such models that
combine data-driven deep learning with symbolic physics models in a principled
manner. However, the accuracy of PINNs degrade when they are used to solve an
entire family of initial value problems characterized by varying parameters and
initial conditions.
  In this paper, we combine symbolic differentiation and Taylor series methods
to propose a class of higher-order models for capturing the solutions to ODEs.
These models combine neural networks and symbolic terms: they use higher order
Lie derivatives and a Taylor series expansion obtained symbolically, with the
remainder term modeled as a neural network. The key insight is that the
remainder term can itself be modeled as a solution to a first-order ODE. We
show how the use of these higher order PINNs can improve accuracy using
interesting, but challenging ODE benchmarks. We also show that the resulting
model can be quite useful for situations such as controlling uncertain physical
systems modeled as ODEs.

Motivation: 传统数值求解PDE系统的计算成本高，而机器学习代理模型在自回归推理中容易因误差累积而影响长期准确性，因此需要一种新方法解决这一问题。

Conclusion: 深度集成方法在多种物理系统中表现出鲁棒性，可作为高效且准确的传统求解器替代方案。

Abstract: Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require
computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field
evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions,
autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over
successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep
ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate
models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and
aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model
predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive
strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We
validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution
in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and
planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in
error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the
method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory
predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers.
Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical
systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to
traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub

Conclusion: 通过自然语言描述和LLM扩展RL状态空间，是提升健康行为干预效果的有效途径。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) methods to support health behavior
change via personalized and just-in-time adaptive interventions is of
significant interest to health and behavioral science researchers focused on
problems such as smoking cessation support and physical activity promotion.
However, RL methods are often applied to these domains using a small collection
of context variables to mitigate the significant data scarcity issues that
arise from practical limitations on the design of adaptive intervention trials.
In this paper, we explore an approach to significantly expanding the state
space of an adaptive intervention without impacting data efficiency. The
proposed approach enables intervention participants to provide natural language
descriptions of aspects of their current state. It then leverages inference
with pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to better align the policy of a
base RL method with these state descriptions. To evaluate our method, we
develop a novel physical activity intervention simulation environment that
generates text-based state descriptions conditioned on latent state variables
using an auxiliary LLM. We show that this approach has the potential to
significantly improve the performance of online policy learning methods.

Conclusion: 神经网络泛化能力由局部极值决定，极值增量算法为解决传统问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We point out that neural networks are not black boxes, and their
generalization stems from the ability to dynamically map a dataset to the local
extrema of the model function. We further prove that the number of local
extrema in a neural network is positively correlated with the number of its
parameters, and on this basis, we give a new algorithm that is different from
the back-propagation algorithm, which we call the extremum-increment algorithm.
Some difficult situations, such as gradient vanishing and overfitting, can be
reasonably explained and dealt with in this framework.

images. GPI leverages open-source Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)
models - such as large language models and diffusion models - not only to
generate unstructured data at scale but also to extract low-dimensional
representations that capture their underlying structure. Applying machine
learning to these representations, GPI enables estimation of causal and
predictive effects while quantifying associated estimation uncertainty. Unlike
existing approaches to representation learning, GPI does not require
fine-tuning of generative models, making it computationally efficient and
broadly accessible. We illustrate the versatility of the GPI framework through
three applications: (1) analyzing Chinese social media censorship, (2)
estimating predictive effects of candidates' facial appearance on electoral
outcomes, and (3) assessing the persuasiveness of political rhetoric. An
open-source software package is available for implementing GPI.

Conclusion: 该Transformer模型为早期诊断提供了有力工具，有望改善患者预后。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure
that affects tens of millions of people worldwide. Early detection of AD is
critical for timely intervention to halt or slow the progression of the
disease. In this study, we propose a Transformer model for predicting the stage
of AD progression at a subject's next clinical visit using features from a
sequence of visits extracted from the subject's visit history. We also
rigorously compare our model to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as long
short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and minimalRNN and assess
their performances based on factors such as the length of prior visits and data
imbalance. We test the importance of different feature categories and visit
history, as well as compare the model to a newer Transformer-based model
optimized for time series. Our model demonstrates strong predictive performance
despite missing visits and missing features in available visits, particularly
in identifying converter subjects -- individuals transitioning to more severe
disease stages -- an area that has posed significant challenges in longitudinal
prediction. The results highlight the model's potential in enhancing early
diagnosis and patient outcomes.

Result: 理论证明了有限状态-动作设置下的收敛性，实验表明算法在多种领域中优于现有风险敏感方法。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了风险敏感策略的优化问题，并在理论和实践中表现优异。

Abstract: The development of Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has introduced
a natural way to incorporate risk sensitivity into value-based and actor-critic
methods by employing risk measures other than expectation in the value
function. While this approach is widely adopted in many online and offline RL
algorithms due to its simplicity, the naive integration of risk measures often
results in suboptimal policies. This limitation can be particularly harmful in
scenarios where the need for effective risk-sensitive policies is critical and
worst-case outcomes carry severe consequences. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel framework for optimizing static Spectral Risk Measures (SRM), a
flexible family of risk measures that generalizes objectives such as CVaR and
Mean-CVaR, and enables the tailoring of risk preferences. Our method is
applicable to both online and offline RL algorithms. We establish theoretical
guarantees by proving convergence in the finite state-action setting. Moreover,
through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithms
consistently outperform existing risk-sensitive methods in both online and
offline environments across diverse domains.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation in the latent space of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
is a powerful framework for optimisation tasks over complex structured domains,
such as the space of scientifically interesting molecules. However, existing
approaches tightly couple the surrogate and generative models, which can lead
to suboptimal performance when the latent space is not tailored to specific
tasks, which in turn has led to the proposal of increasingly sophisticated
algorithms. In this work, we explore a new direction, instead proposing a
decoupled approach that trains a generative model and a Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogate separately, then combines them via a simple yet principled Bayesian
update rule. This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths --
structure generation from the VAE and predictive modelling by the GP. We show
that our decoupled approach improves our ability to identify high-potential
candidates in molecular optimisation problems under constrained evaluation
budgets.

Conclusion: CAPIMAC为多模态数据的不平衡和未对齐问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal representation is faithful and highly effective in describing
real-world data samples' characteristics by describing their complementary
information. However, the collected data often exhibits incomplete and
misaligned characteristics due to factors such as inconsistent sensor
frequencies and device malfunctions. Existing research has not effectively
addressed the issue of filling missing data in scenarios where multiview data
are both imbalanced and misaligned. Instead, it relies on class-level alignment
of the available data. Thus, it results in some data samples not being
well-matched, thereby affecting the quality of data fusion. In this paper, we
propose the Consistency-Aware Padding for Incomplete Multimodal Alignment
Clustering Based on Self-Repellent Greedy Anchor Search(CAPIMAC) to tackle the
problem of filling imbalanced and misaligned data in multimodal datasets.
Specifically, we propose a self-repellent greedy anchor search module(SRGASM),
which employs a self-repellent random walk combined with a greedy algorithm to
identify anchor points for re-representing incomplete and misaligned multimodal
data. Subsequently, based on noise-contrastive learning, we design a
consistency-aware padding module (CAPM) to effectively interpolate and align
imbalanced and misaligned data, thereby improving the quality of multimodal
data fusion. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method
over benchmark datasets. The code will be publicly released at

Conclusion: 结合GNN和MILP的mol-infer-GNN框架在分子推断中表现出色，尤其在性能和灵活性方面。

Abstract: Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of
chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property
values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using
mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process
of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient
conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches
usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors
to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of
descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation,
the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A
lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred
chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great
importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising
machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input,
and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction
problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to
the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we
develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely
mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great
flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of
the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on
the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying
learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can
infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within
reasonable computational time.

Conclusion: MCST-Mamba模型在多变量交通预测中表现优异，参数效率高，更贴近实际拥堵情景。

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction plays a vital role in intelligent transportation
systems by enabling efficient routing, congestion mitigation, and proactive
traffic control. However, forecasting is challenging due to the combined
effects of dynamic road conditions, varying traffic patterns across different
locations, and external influences such as weather and accidents. Traffic data
often consists of several interrelated measurements - such as speed, flow and
occupancy - yet many deep-learning approaches either predict only one of these
variables or require a separate model for each. This limits their ability to
capture joint patterns across channels. To address this, we introduce the
Multi-Channel Spatio-Temporal (MCST) Mamba model, a forecasting framework built
on the Mamba selective state-space architecture that natively handles
multivariate inputs and simultaneously models all traffic features. The
proposed MCST-Mamba model integrates adaptive spatio-temporal embeddings and
separates the modeling of temporal sequences and spatial sensor interactions
into two dedicated Mamba blocks, improving representation learning. Unlike
prior methods that evaluate on a single channel, we assess MCST-Mamba across
all traffic features at once, aligning more closely with how congestion arises
in practice. Our results show that MCST-Mamba achieves strong predictive
performance with a lower parameter count compared to baseline models.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs offer a structured representation of real-world entities and
their relationships, enabling a wide range of applications from information
retrieval to automated reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
comparison between traditional rule-based approaches and modern deep learning
methods for link prediction. We focus on KBGAT, a graph neural network model
that leverages multi-head attention to jointly encode both entity and relation
features within local neighborhood structures. To advance this line of
research, we introduce \textbf{GCAT} (Graph Collaborative Attention Network), a
refined model that enhances context aggregation and interaction between
heterogeneous nodes. Experimental results on four widely-used benchmark
datasets demonstrate that GCAT not only consistently outperforms rule-based
methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
existing neural embedding models. Our findings highlight the advantages of
attention-based architectures in capturing complex relational patterns for
knowledge graph completion tasks.

performance can be significantly boosted by a targeted continued pre-training
phase. Specifically, we demonstrate that leveraging a small, curated collection
of large, real-world datasets for continued pre-training yields superior
downstream predictive accuracy compared to using broader, potentially noisier
corpora like CommonCrawl or GitTables. Our resulting model, Real-TabPFN,
achieves substantial performance gains on 29 datasets from the OpenML AutoML
Benchmark.

Abstract: A lightweight, edge-deployable pipeline is proposed for detecting sensor
anomalies in chemistry and biology laboratories. A custom PCB captures seven
sensor channels and streams them over the local network. An Attention-based
One-Class Autoencoder reaches a usable state after training on only thirty
minutes of normal data. Despite the small data set, the model already attains
an F1 score of 0.72, a precision of 0.89, and a recall of 0.61 when tested on
synthetic micro-anomalies. The trained network is converted into a
TensorFlow-Lite binary of about 31 kB and runs on an Advantech ARK-1221L, a
fan-less x86 edge device without AVX instructions; end-to-end inference latency
stays below two seconds. The entire collect-train-deploy workflow finishes
within one hour, which demonstrates that the pipeline adapts quickly whenever a

Result: 在MLM预训练和克隆检测微调任务中，Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa在损失、准确率、F1分数等指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 显式嵌入源代码的结构信息能显著提升Transformer模型的表示能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated significant success in various
source code representation tasks. Nonetheless, traditional positional
embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical
structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax
Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional
embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived
from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical
embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically
enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model
through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection
fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced
CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy,
F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating
explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of
source code.

Abstract: Urban socioeconomic modeling has predominantly concentrated on extensive
location and neighborhood-based features, relying on the localized population
footprint. However, networks in urban systems are common, and many urban
modeling methods don't account for network-based effects. In this study, we
propose using commute information records from the census as a reliable and
comprehensive source to construct mobility networks across cities. Leveraging
deep learning architectures, we employ these commute networks across U.S. metro
areas for socioeconomic modeling. We show that mobility network structures
provide significant predictive performance without considering any node
features. Consequently, we use mobility networks to present a supervised
learning framework to model a city's socioeconomic indicator directly,
combining Graph Neural Network and Vanilla Neural Network models to learn all
parameters in a single learning pipeline. Our experiments in 12 major U.S.
cities show the proposed model outperforms previous conventional machine
learning models. This work provides urban researchers methods to incorporate
network effects in urban modeling and informs stakeholders of wider
network-based effects in urban policymaking and planning.

Method: 开发了两种基于影响函数（IF）的数据评估方法，分别是基于Hessian的IF和基于梯度轨迹的IF。

Result: 实验证明这两种方法在数据评估和参数调优中有效，适用于识别错误标签数据、模型编辑等任务。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在SAM框架下提供了更准确和高效的数据评估方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in large-scale
model training by linking loss landscape geometry to generalization. However,
challenges such as mislabeled noisy data and privacy concerns have emerged as
significant issues. Data attribution, which identifies the contributions of
specific training samples, offers a promising solution. However, directly
rendering existing data influence evaluation tools such as influence functions
(IF) to SAM will be inapplicable or inaccurate as SAM utilizes an inner loop to
find model perturbations that maximize loss, which the outer loop then
minimizes, resulting in a doubled computational structure. Additionally, this
bilevel structure complicates the modeling of data influence on the parameters.
In this paper, based on the IF, we develop two innovative data valuation
methods for SAM, each offering unique benefits in different scenarios: the
Hessian-based IF and the Gradient Trajectory-based IF. The first one provides a
comprehensive estimation of data influence using a closed-form measure that
relies only on the trained model weights. In contrast, the other IF for SAM
utilizes gradient trajectory information during training for more accurate and
efficient data assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate their
effectiveness in data evaluation and parameter tuning, with applications in
identifying mislabeled data, model editing, and enhancing interpretability.

Result: 在Crafter基准测试中达到最新性能，首次在10M环境步内超越人类专家表现，并解锁所有22项成就。

Conclusion: EMERALD展示了高效准确的世界建模方法在改进代理性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: The Dreamer algorithm has recently obtained remarkable performance across
diverse environment domains by training powerful agents with simulated
trajectories. However, the compressed nature of its world model's latent space
can result in the loss of crucial information, negatively affecting the agent's
performance. Recent approaches, such as $\Delta$-IRIS and DIAMOND, address this
limitation by training more accurate world models. However, these methods
require training agents directly from pixels, which reduces training efficiency
and prevents the agent from benefiting from the inner representations learned
by the world model. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to world
modeling that is both accurate and efficient. We introduce EMERALD (Efficient
MaskEd latent tRAnsformer worLD model), a world model using a spatial latent
state with MaskGIT predictions to generate accurate trajectories in latent
space and improve the agent performance. On the Crafter benchmark, EMERALD
achieves new state-of-the-art performance, becoming the first method to surpass
human experts performance within 10M environment steps. Our method also
succeeds to unlock all 22 Crafter achievements at least once during evaluation.

Abstract: Inductive learning aims to construct general models from specific examples,
guided by biases that influence hypothesis selection and determine

relational inductive biases present in attention mechanisms, understood as
assumptions about the underlying relationships between data elements. From the
perspective of geometric deep learning, we analyze the most common attention
mechanisms in terms of their equivariance properties with respect to
permutation subgroups, which allows us to propose a classification based on
their relational biases. Under this perspective, we show that different
attention layers are characterized by the underlying relationships they assume
on the input data.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有的DFKD方法通常假设教师模型是可信的，而忽略了从未经信任的教师模型中进行知识蒸馏时的鲁棒性和安全性问题。本文首次研究了从非可转移学习（NTL）教师模型中蒸馏知识的问题。

Method: 提出Adversarial Trap Escaping（ATEsc）方法，基于NTL教师对ID和OOD样本的不同对抗鲁棒性，将合成样本分为两组：ID类样本用于正常蒸馏，OOD类样本用于遗忘OOD知识。

Result: 实验表明，ATEsc能有效提升DFKD在面对NTL教师时的性能。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了NTL教师在DFKD中的误导行为，并提出了ATEsc方法来解决这一问题，为DFKD的鲁棒性和安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access the real in-distribution (ID) data. Its common
solution is to use a generator to synthesize fake data and use them as a
substitute for real ID data. However, existing works typically assume teachers
are trustworthy, leaving the robustness and security of DFKD from untrusted
teachers largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first investigation
into distilling non-transferable learning (NTL) teachers using DFKD, where the
transferability from an ID domain to an out-of-distribution (OOD) domain is
prohibited. We find that NTL teachers fool DFKD through divert the generator's
attention from the useful ID knowledge to the misleading OOD knowledge. This
hinders ID knowledge transfer but prioritizes OOD knowledge transfer. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Adversarial Trap Escaping (ATEsc) to benefit
DFKD by identifying and filtering out OOD-like synthetic samples. Specifically,
inspired by the evidence that NTL teachers show stronger adversarial robustness
on OOD samples than ID samples, we split synthetic samples into two groups
according to their robustness. The fragile group is treated as ID-like data and
used for normal knowledge distillation, while the robust group is seen as
OOD-like data and utilized for forgetting OOD knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of ATEsc for improving DFKD against NTL teachers.

Result: 实验表明GNN在性能上与Transformer相当，但计算资源消耗更少。

Conclusion: 挑战了Transformer是最优选择的观念，为单细胞转录组学提供了新视角。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers share significant similarities
in their encoding strategies for interacting with features from nodes of
interest, where Transformers use query-key scores and GNNs use edges. Compared
to GNNs, which are unable to encode relative positions, Transformers leverage
dynamic attention capabilities to better represent relative relationships,
thereby becoming the standard backbones in large-scale sequential pre-training.
However, the subtle difference prompts us to consider: if positions are no
longer crucial, could we substitute Transformers with Graph Neural Networks in
some fields such as Single-Cell Transcriptomics? In this paper, we first
explore the similarities and differences between GNNs and Transformers,
specifically in terms of relative positions. Additionally, we design a
synthetic example to illustrate their equivalence where there are no relative
positions between tokens in the sample. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on a large-scale position-agnostic dataset-single-cell
transcriptomics-finding that GNNs achieve competitive performance compared to
Transformers while consuming fewer computation resources. These findings
provide novel insights for researchers in the field of single-cell
transcriptomics, challenging the prevailing notion that the Transformer is
always the optimum choice.

Result: TM的概率评分与数据的基础概率相关，且在训练数据域外表现谨慎，避免了神经网络的外推现象。

Conclusion: 该方法为TM提供了更深入的解释性，并在图像分类任务中展现了潜在改进空间。

Abstract: Data modeling using Tsetlin machines (TMs) is all about building logical
rules from the data features. The decisions of the model are based on a
combination of these logical rules. Hence, the model is fully transparent and
it is possible to get explanations of its predictions. In this paper, we
present a probability score for TM predictions and develop new techniques for
uncertainty quantification to increase the explainability further. The
probability score is an inherent property of any TM variant and is derived
through an analysis of the TM learning dynamics. Simulated data is used to show
a clear connection between the learned TM probability scores and the underlying
probabilities of the data. A visualization of the probability scores also
reveals that the TM is less confident in its predictions outside the training
data domain, which contrasts the typical extrapolation phenomenon found in
Artificial Neural Networks. The paper concludes with an application of the
uncertainty quantification techniques on an image classification task using the
CIFAR-10 dataset, where they provide new insights and suggest possible
improvements to current TM image classification models.

Abstract: Differentiable programming that enables automatic differentiation through
simulation pipelines has emerged as a powerful paradigm in scientific
computing, supporting both forward and inverse modeling and facilitating
integration with deep learning frameworks. We present JAX-MPM, a
general-purpose differentiable meshfree solver within a hybrid
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework, tailored for simulating complex continuum
mechanics involving large deformations, frictional contact, and inelastic
material behavior, with emphasis on geomechanics and geophysical hazard
applications. Built on the material point method (MPM) and implemented using
the JAX computing framework, JAX-MPM is fully differentiable and
GPU-accelerated, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization directly
through time-stepping solvers. It supports joint training of physical models
and neural networks, allowing the learning of embedded closures and neural
constitutive models. We validate JAX-MPM on several 2D and 3D benchmarks,
including dam-breaks and granular collapses, demonstrating its accuracy and
performance. A high-resolution 3D granular cylinder collapse with 2.7 million
particles completes 1000 steps in ~22 seconds (single precision) and ~98
seconds (double precision) on a single GPU. Beyond forward modeling, we
demonstrate inverse modeling capabilities such as velocity field reconstruction
and spatially varying friction estimation. These results establish JAX-MPM as a
unified, scalable platform for differentiable meshfree simulation and
data-driven geomechanical inference.

Abstract: Air pollution poses a critical health threat in cities worldwide, with
nitrogen dioxide levels in Cork, Ireland exceeding World Health Organization
safety standards by up to $278\%$. This study leverages artificial intelligence
to predict air pollution with unprecedented accuracy, analyzing nearly ten
years of data from five monitoring stations combined with 30 years of weather
records. We evaluated 17 machine learning algorithms, with Extra Trees emerging
as the optimal solution, achieving $77\%$ prediction accuracy and significantly
outperforming traditional forecasting methods. Our analysis reveals that
meteorological conditions particularly temperature, wind speed, and humidity
are the primary drivers of pollution levels, while traffic patterns and
seasonal changes create predictable pollution cycles. Pollution exhibits
dramatic seasonal variations, with winter levels nearly double those of summer,
and daily rush-hour peaks reaching $120\%$ above normal levels. While Cork's
air quality shows concerning violations of global health standards, our models
detected an encouraging $31\%$ improvement from 2014 to 2022. This research
demonstrates that intelligent forecasting systems can provide city planners and
environmental officials with powerful prediction tools, enabling life-saving
early warning systems and informed urban planning decisions. The technology
exists today to transform urban air quality management. All research materials

Result: 显式表达形式展示了前向过程噪声对学习预测器的影响，新证明为扩散模型的理论提供了更严格的数学基础。

Conclusion: 本研究为DDPMs的理论分析提供了新的视角，有助于进一步理解和设计扩散模型。

Abstract: In denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), the learned noise
predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ is trained to approximate the
forward-process noise $\epsilon_t$. The equality $\nabla_{{\bf x}_t} \log
q({\bf x}_t) = -\frac 1 {\sqrt {1- {\bar \alpha}_t} } \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$ plays a fundamental role in both theoretical analyses and
algorithmic design, and thus is frequently employed across diffusion-based
generative models. In this paper, an explicit formulation of $
\epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf x}_t , t)$ in terms of the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ is derived. This result show how the forward-process noise
$\epsilon_t$ contributes to the learned predictor $ \epsilon_{\theta} ( {\bf
x}_t , t)$. Furthermore, based on this formulation, we present a novel and
mathematically rigorous proof of the fundamental equality above, clarifying its
origin and providing new theoretical insight into the structure of diffusion
models.

Key words: LLM, unlearning, privacy, Partial Model Collapse, sensitive data

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法-Partial Model Collapse (PMC)，通过部分触发模型崩溃来删除敏感数据，无需在目标中显式优化遗忘数据，有效解决了现有方法的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘方法在训练目标中引入敏感数据，可能强化其暴露风险，违背最小化使用原则，因此需要一种更安全的遗忘方法。

Method: 提出PMC，利用生成模型在自身生成数据上训练导致分布崩溃的特性，部分触发崩溃以删除敏感数据，无需显式优化遗忘目标。

Result: 理论分析表明PMC能收敛到预期结果，实证显示其有效删除了模型输出中的隐私信息，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: PMC为实现更全面的遗忘提供了一种新思路，符合实际隐私约束要求。

Abstract: Current unlearning methods for LLMs optimize on the private information they
seek to remove by incorporating it into their training objectives. We argue
this not only risks reinforcing exposure to sensitive data, it also
fundamentally contradicts the principle of minimizing its use. As a remedy, we
propose a novel unlearning method - Partial Model Collapse (PMC), which does
not require unlearning targets in the unlearning objective. Our approach is
inspired by recent observations that training generative models on their own
generations leads to distribution collapse, effectively removing information
from the model. Our core idea is to leverage this collapse for unlearning by
triggering collapse partially on the sensitive data. We theoretically analyze
that our approach converges to the desired outcome, i.e. the LLM unlearns the
information in the forget set. We empirically demonstrate that PMC overcomes
two key limitations of existing unlearning approaches that explicitly optimize
on unlearning targets, and more effectively removes private information from
model outputs. Overall, our contributions represent an important step toward
more comprehensive unlearning that aligns with real-world privacy constraints.

Result: 模型能够生成目标结合的环肽，成功率随环化策略不同介于38%至84%之间。

Conclusion: CP-Composer为环肽设计提供了零样本生成的新方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Cyclic peptides, characterized by geometric constraints absent in linear
peptides, offer enhanced biochemical properties, presenting new opportunities
to address unmet medical needs. However, designing target-specific cyclic
peptides remains underexplored due to limited training data. To bridge the gap,
we propose CP-Composer, a novel generative framework that enables zero-shot
cyclic peptide generation via composable geometric constraints. Our approach
decomposes complex cyclization patterns into unit constraints, which are
incorporated into a diffusion model through geometric conditioning on nodes and
edges. During training, the model learns from unit constraints and their random
combinations in linear peptides, while at inference, novel constraint
combinations required for cyclization are imposed as input. Experiments show
that our model, despite trained with linear peptides, is capable of generating
diverse target-binding cyclic peptides, reaching success rates from 38% to 84%
on different cyclization strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 低秩恢复在压缩感知中已有广泛应用，但传统方法难以处理高阶张量数据，因此需要扩展迭代硬阈值方法以支持张量恢复。

Result: 数值实验表明TNIHT在合成数据、图像和视频上的恢复性能优于现有算法。

Conclusion: TNIHT是一种高效的低秩张量恢复方法，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: Low-rank recovery builds upon ideas from the theory of compressive sensing,
which predicts that sparse signals can be accurately reconstructed from
incomplete measurements. Iterative thresholding-type algorithms-particularly
the normalized iterative hard thresholding (NIHT) method-have been widely used
in compressed sensing (CS) and applied to matrix recovery tasks. In this paper,
we propose a tensor extension of NIHT, referred to as TNIHT, for the recovery
of low-rank tensors under two widely used tensor decomposition models. This
extension enables the effective reconstruction of high-order low-rank tensors
from a limited number of linear measurements by leveraging the inherent
low-dimensional structure of multi-way data. Specifically, we consider both the
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) rank and the Tucker rank to characterize tensor
low-rankness within the TNIHT framework. At the same time, we establish a
convergence theorem for the proposed TNIHT method under the tensor restricted
isometry property (TRIP), providing theoretical support for its recovery
guarantees. Finally, we evaluate the performance of TNIHT through numerical
experiments on synthetic, image, and video data, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有Transformer和次二次架构在处理长序列时存在成本过高或过低的问题，且滑动窗口注意力等方法会损害上下文学习效果。

Method: 提出了“power attention”架构，提供线性成本的序列建模，并开发了高效的GPU内核以避免内存和带宽瓶颈。

Result: 实验表明，“power attention”在长上下文训练中优于指数注意力和线性注意力。

Conclusion: “power attention”是一种高效且灵活的序列建模解决方案，适用于长序列任务。

Abstract: We argue that neither transformers nor sub-quadratic architectures are well
suited to training at long sequence lengths: the cost of processing the context
is too expensive in the former, too inexpensive in the latter. Approaches such
as sliding window attention which reduce the cost-per-token of a transformer
impair in-context learning, and so are also unsuitable. To address these
limitations, we introduce power attention, an architectural layer for
linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,
identifying a novel pattern of operation fusion to avoid memory and bandwidth
bottlenecks. Our experiments on the in-context learning of power attention
shows that these models dominate both exponential attention and linear
attention at long-context training.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在安全对齐中的过度拒绝问题，提升用户体验和模型实用性。

Method: 利用多样查询的内部激活模式，微调单一模型层以减少过度拒绝。

Result: 在多基准测试中有效减少过度拒绝，同时保持对有害查询的处理能力和模型实用性。

Conclusion: ACTOR框架在减少过度拒绝和保持模型安全性之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: Safety alignment is crucial for large language models (LLMs) to resist
malicious instructions but often results in over-refusals, where benign prompts
are unnecessarily rejected, impairing user experience and model utility. We
introduce ACTOR (Activation-Based Training for Over-Refusal Reduction), a
robust and compute- and data-efficient training framework that minimizes
over-refusals by leveraging internal activation patterns from diverse queries.
ACTOR precisely identifies and adjusts the activation components that trigger
refusals, providing stronger control over the refusal mechanism. By fine-tuning
only a single model layer, ACTOR effectively reduces over-refusals across
multiple benchmarks while maintaining the model's ability to handle harmful
queries and preserve overall utility.

Conclusion: Retformer结合可解释技术为AD早期诊断提供了新途径，验证了视网膜影像的诊断价值。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects
millions worldwide. In the absence of effective treatment options, early
diagnosis is crucial for initiating management strategies to delay disease
onset and slow down its progression. In this study, we propose Retformer, a
novel transformer-based architecture for detecting AD using retinal imaging
modalities, leveraging the power of transformers and explainable artificial
intelligence. The Retformer model is trained on datasets of different
modalities of retinal images from patients with AD and age-matched healthy
controls, enabling it to learn complex patterns and relationships between image
features and disease diagnosis. To provide insights into the decision-making
process of our model, we employ the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
algorithm to visualize the feature importance maps, highlighting the regions of
the retinal images that contribute most significantly to the classification
outcome. These findings are compared to existing clinical studies on detecting
AD using retinal biomarkers, allowing us to identify the most important
features for AD detection in each imaging modality. The Retformer model
outperforms a variety of benchmark algorithms across different performance
metrics by margins of up to 11\.

Abstract: Feedback control of fluid-based systems poses significant challenges due to
their high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics, which demand
real-time, three-dimensional, multi-component measurements for sensing. While
such measurements are feasible in digital simulations, they are often only
partially accessible in the real world. In this paper, we propose a method to
adapt feedback control policies obtained from full-state measurements to setups
with only partial measurements. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated
environment by minimising the aerodynamic drag of a simplified road vehicle.
Reinforcement learning algorithms can optimally solve this control task when
trained on full-state measurements by placing sensors in the wake. However, in
real-world applications, sensors are limited and typically only on the vehicle,
providing only partial measurements. To address this, we propose to train a
Domain Specific Feature Transfer (DSFT) map reconstructing the full
measurements from the history of the partial measurements. By applying this
map, we derive optimal policies based solely on partial data. Additionally, our
method enables determination of the optimal history length and offers insights
into the architecture of optimal control policies, facilitating their
implementation in real-world environments with limited sensor information.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，ProtoNorm能更好地分离原型，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProtoNorm继承了PBFL的通信效率，适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Heterogeneity in data distributions and model architectures remains a
significant challenge in federated learning (FL). Various heterogeneous FL
(HtFL) approaches have recently been proposed to address this challenge. Among
them, prototype-based FL (PBFL) has emerged as a practical framework that only
shares per-class mean activations from the penultimate layer. However, PBFL
approaches often suffer from suboptimal prototype separation, limiting their
discriminative power. We propose Prototype Normalization (ProtoNorm), a novel
PBFL framework that addresses this limitation through two key components:
Prototype Alignment (PA) and Prototype Upscaling (PU). The PA method draws
inspiration from the Thomson problem in classical physics, optimizing global
prototype configurations on a unit sphere to maximize angular separation;
subsequently, the PU method increases prototype magnitudes to enhance
separation in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show
that our approach better separates prototypes and thus consistently outperforms
existing HtFL approaches. Notably, since ProtoNorm inherits the communication
efficiency of PBFL and the PA is performed server-side, it is particularly
suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 在资源受限环境中，联邦学习的通信效率是关键挑战。现有原型方法在大特征维度和多类别时效率下降。

Result: 实验表明，TinyProto通信成本降低至现有方法的4倍，且不影响性能。

Conclusion: TinyProto在通信效率和资源受限异构环境中表现优越。

Abstract: Communication efficiency in federated learning (FL) remains a critical
challenge for resource-constrained environments. While prototype-based FL
reduces communication overhead by sharing class prototypes-mean activations in
the penultimate layer-instead of model parameters, its efficiency decreases
with larger feature dimensions and class counts. We propose TinyProto, which
addresses these limitations through Class-wise Prototype Sparsification (CPS)
and adaptive prototype scaling. CPS enables structured sparsity by allocating
specific dimensions to class prototypes and transmitting only non-zero
elements, while adaptive scaling adjusts prototypes based on class
distributions. Our experiments show TinyProto reduces communication costs by up
to 4x compared to existing methods while maintaining performance. Beyond its
communication efficiency, TinyProto offers crucial advantages: achieving
compression without client-side computational overhead and supporting
heterogeneous architectures, making it ideal for resource-constrained
heterogeneous FL.

Abstract: Numerous algorithms have been developed for Conditional Average Treatment
Effect (CATE) estimation. In this paper, we first highlight a common issue
where many algorithms exhibit inconsistent learning behavior for the same
instance across different group assignments. We introduce a metric to quantify
and visualize this inconsistency. Next, we present a theoretical analysis
showing that this inconsistency indeed contributes to higher test errors and
cannot be resolved through conventional machine learning techniques. To address
this problem, we propose a general method called \textbf{Consistent Labeling
Across Group Assignments} (CLAGA), which eliminates the inconsistency and is
applicable to any existing CATE estimation algorithm. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance
improvements with CLAGA.

Conclusion: 交互式可视化与主动学习显著提升了RLHF的效果，为人类-AI对齐研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
enabling technology for aligning AI behavior with human preferences. The
traditional way to collect data in RLHF is via pairwise comparisons: human
raters are asked to indicate which one of two samples they prefer. We present
an interactive visualization that better exploits the human visual ability to
compare and explore whole groups of samples. The interface is comprised of two
linked views: 1) an exploration view showing a contextual overview of all
sampled behaviors organized in a hierarchical clustering structure; and 2) a
comparison view displaying two selected groups of behaviors for user queries.
Users can efficiently explore large sets of behaviors by iterating between
these two views. Additionally, we devised an active learning approach
suggesting groups for comparison. As shown by our evaluation in six simulated
robotics tasks, our approach increases the final policy returns by 69.34%. It
leads to lower error rates and better policies. We open-source the code that
can be easily integrated into the RLHF training loop, supporting research on
human-AI alignment.

Abstract: Understanding the contribution of individual features in predictive models
remains a central goal in interpretable machine learning, and while many
model-agnostic methods exist to estimate feature importance, they often fall
short in capturing high-order interactions and disentangling overlapping
contributions. In this work, we present an information-theoretic extension of
the High-order interactions for Feature importance (Hi-Fi) method, leveraging
Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) estimated via a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
approach working on mixed discrete and continuous random variables. Our
framework decomposes feature contributions into unique, synergistic, and
redundant components, offering a richer, model-independent understanding of
their predictive roles. We validate the method using synthetic datasets with
known Gaussian structures, where ground truth interaction patterns are
analytically derived, and further test it on non-Gaussian and real-world gene
expression data from TCGA-BRCA. Results indicate that the proposed estimator
accurately recovers theoretical and expected findings, providing a potential
use case for developing feature selection algorithms or model development based
on interaction analysis.

Result: FF在作物分类任务上达到69.6% IoU，FP将产量预测误差降至30.7% MAPE；FF在印度全国尺度的田界划分任务上也优于基线，达到54.2% IoU。

Conclusion: 农业专用预训练任务能有效利用时间特性，显著提升农业遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: Self Supervised Learning(SSL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
label-efficient learning, and has been widely utilized by remote sensing
foundation models(RSFMs). Recent RSFMs including SatMAE, DoFA, primarily rely
on masked autoencoding(MAE), contrastive learning or some combination of them.
However, these pretext tasks often overlook the unique temporal characteristics
of agricultural landscape, namely nature's cycle. Motivated by this gap, we
propose three novel agriculture-specific pretext tasks, namely Time-Difference
Prediction(TD), Temporal Frequency Prediction(FP), and Future-Frame
Prediction(FF). Comprehensive evaluation on SICKLE dataset shows FF achieves
69.6% IoU on crop mapping and FP reduces yield prediction error to 30.7% MAPE,
outperforming all baselines, and TD remains competitive on most tasks. Further,
we also scale FF to the national scale of India, achieving 54.2% IoU
outperforming all baselines on field boundary delineation on FTW India dataset.

Method: 将恶意软件分类建模为马尔可夫决策过程，采用Dueling Double Deep Q-Network（D3QN）框架进行动态特征选择。

Result: 在Microsoft Big2015和BODMAS数据集上，D3QN分别达到99.22%和98.83%的准确率，平均仅使用61和56个特征，计算效率提升30.1倍和42.5倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习的动态特征选择方法在恶意软件分类中实现了高准确性和计算效率，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Traditional malware detection methods exhibit computational inefficiency due
to exhaustive feature extraction requirements, creating accuracy-efficiency
trade-offs that limit real-time deployment. We formulate malware classification
as a Markov Decision Process with episodic feature acquisition and propose a
Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) framework for adaptive sequential feature
selection. The agent learns to dynamically select informative features per
sample before terminating with classification decisions, optimizing both
detection accuracy and computational cost through reinforcement learning.
  We evaluate our approach on Microsoft Big2015 (9-class, 1,795 features) and
BODMAS (binary, 2,381 features) datasets. D3QN achieves 99.22% and 98.83%
accuracy while utilizing only 61 and 56 features on average, representing 96.6%
and 97.6% dimensionality reduction. This yields computational efficiency
improvements of 30.1x and 42.5x over traditional ensemble methods.
Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent superiority over Random
Forest, XGBoost, and static feature selection approaches.
  Quantitative analysis demonstrates that D3QN learns non-random feature
selection policies with 62.5% deviation from uniform baseline distributions.
The learned policies exhibit structured hierarchical preferences, utilizing
high-level metadata features for initial assessment while selectively
incorporating detailed behavioral features based on classification uncertainty.
Feature specialization analysis reveals 57.7% of examined features demonstrate
significant class-specific discrimination patterns. Our results validate
reinforcement learning-based sequential feature selection for malware
classification, achieving superior accuracy with substantial computational
reduction through learned adaptive policies.

Conclusion: 论文通过理论与实验验证了因果层次强化学习框架的优越性，尤其在训练效率方面。

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) improves the efficiency of
long-horizon reinforcement-learning tasks with sparse rewards by decomposing
the task into a hierarchy of subgoals. The main challenge of HRL is efficient
discovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this
structure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the
subgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to
learn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random
during exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize
subgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.
These targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in
terms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked
theoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.
Specifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements. Our
experimental results on HRL tasks also illustrate that our proposed framework
outperforms existing work in terms of training cost.

Result: APCs在重建质量、嵌入表示和缺失数据处理上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: APCs展示了PCs在表示学习中的潜力，为鲁棒推理和知识蒸馏提供新方向。

Abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are powerful probabilistic models that enable
exact and tractable inference, making them highly suitable for probabilistic
reasoning and inference tasks. While dominant in neural networks,
representation learning with PCs remains underexplored, with prior approaches
relying on external neural embeddings or activation-based encodings. To address
this gap, we introduce autoencoding probabilistic circuits (APCs), a novel
framework leveraging the tractability of PCs to model probabilistic embeddings
explicitly. APCs extend PCs by jointly modeling data and embeddings, obtaining
embedding representations through tractable probabilistic inference. The PC
encoder allows the framework to natively handle arbitrary missing data and is
seamlessly integrated with a neural decoder in a hybrid, end-to-end trainable
architecture enabled by differentiable sampling. Our empirical evaluation
demonstrates that APCs outperform existing PC-based autoencoding methods in
reconstruction quality, generate embeddings competitive with, and exhibit
superior robustness in handling missing data compared to neural autoencoders.
These results highlight APCs as a powerful and flexible representation learning
method that exploits the probabilistic inference capabilities of PCs, showing
promising directions for robust inference, out-of-distribution detection, and
knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: 揭示了IRL在揭示偏好和贝叶斯框架下的潜力，为动态环境中的自适应IRL提供了新方法。

Abstract: This monograph, spanning three chapters, explores Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL). The first two chapters view inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) through the lens of revealed preferences from microeconomics while the
third chapter studies adaptive IRL via Langevin dynamics stochastic gradient
algorithms.
  Chapter uses classical revealed preference theory (Afriat's theorem and
extensions) to identify constrained utility maximizers based on observed agent
actions. This allows for the reconstruction of set-valued estimates of an
agent's utility. We illustrate this procedure by identifying the presence of a
cognitive radar and reconstructing its utility function. The chapter also
addresses the construction of a statistical detector for utility maximization
behavior when agent actions are corrupted by noise.
  Chapter 2 studies Bayesian IRL. It investigates how an analyst can determine
if an observed agent is a rationally inattentive Bayesian utility maximizer
(i.e., simultaneously optimizing its utility and observation likelihood). The
chapter discusses inverse stopping-time problems, focusing on reconstructing
the continuation and stopping costs of a Bayesian agent operating over a random
horizon. We then apply this IRL methodology to identify the presence of a
Bayes-optimal sequential detector. Additionally, Chapter 2 provides a concise
overview of discrete choice models, inverse Bayesian filtering, and inverse
stochastic gradient algorithms for adaptive IRL.
  Finally, Chapter 3 introduces an adaptive IRL approach utilizing passive
Langevin dynamics. This method aims to track time-varying utility functions
given noisy and misspecified gradients. In essence, the adaptive IRL algorithms
presented in Chapter 3 can be conceptualized as inverse stochastic gradient
algorithms, as they learn the utility function in real-time while a stochastic
gradient algorithm is in operation.

Conclusion: VGD条件比传统条件更弱，且实验表明其在实际环境中具有相关性。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) in the agnostic policy learning setting,
where the goal is to find a policy whose performance is competitive with the
best policy in a given class of interest $\Pi$ -- crucially, without assuming
that $\Pi$ contains the optimal policy. We propose a general policy learning
framework that reduces this problem to first-order optimization in a
non-Euclidean space, leading to new algorithms as well as shedding light on the
convergence properties of existing ones. Specifically, under the assumption
that $\Pi$ is convex and satisfies a variational gradient dominance (VGD)
condition -- an assumption known to be strictly weaker than more standard
completeness and coverability conditions -- we obtain sample complexity upper
bounds for three policy learning algorithms: \emph{(i)} Steepest Descent Policy
Optimization, derived from a constrained steepest descent method for non-convex
optimization; \emph{(ii)} the classical Conservative Policy Iteration algorithm
\citep{kakade2002approximately} reinterpreted through the lens of the
Frank-Wolfe method, which leads to improved convergence results; and
\emph{(iii)} an on-policy instantiation of the well-studied Policy Mirror
Descent algorithm. Finally, we empirically evaluate the VGD condition across
several standard environments, demonstrating the practical relevance of our key
assumption.

Abstract: A hierarchical labeling system for mobile applications (apps) benefits a wide
range of downstream businesses that integrate the labeling with their
proprietary user data, to improve user modeling. Such a label hierarchy can
define more granular labels that capture detailed app features beyond the
limitations of traditional broad app categories. In this paper, we address the
problem of hierarchical multilabel classification for apps by using their
textual information such as names and descriptions. We present: 1) HMCN
(Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Network) for handling the
classification from two perspectives: the first focuses on a multilabel
classification without hierarchical constraints, while the second predicts
labels sequentially at each hierarchical level considering such constraints; 2)
HMCL (Hierarchical Multilabel Contrastive Learning), a scheme that is capable
of learning more distinguishable app representations to enhance the performance
of HMCN. Empirical results on our Tencent App Store dataset and two public
datasets demonstrate that our approach performs well compared with
state-of-the-art methods. The approach has been deployed at Tencent and the
multilabel classification outputs for apps have helped a downstream
task--credit risk management of user--improve its performance by 10.70% with
regard to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric, for over one year.

Conclusion: 尾部风险感知的攻击和评估方法对准确评估和加强LLM安全性至关重要。

Abstract: To guarantee safe and robust deployment of large language models (LLMs) at
scale, it is critical to accurately assess their adversarial robustness.
Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in
single-point, greedy generations, overlooking the inherently stochastic nature
of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adversarial robustness
evaluation that explicitly models the entire output distribution, including
tail-risks, providing better estimates for model robustness at scale. By
casting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between
optimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that
integrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves
efficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to
analyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.
Surprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on
output harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept
objective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware
perspective enables new optimization targets. Overall, our findings highlight
the importance of tail-aware attacks and evaluation protocols to accurately
assess and strengthen LLM safety.

Abstract: We develop a theory of transfer learning in infinitely wide neural networks
where both the pretraining (source) and downstream (target) task can operate in
a feature learning regime. We analyze both the Bayesian framework, where
learning is described by a posterior distribution over the weights, and
gradient flow training of randomly initialized networks trained with weight
decay. Both settings track how representations evolve in both source and target
tasks. The summary statistics of these theories are adapted feature kernels
which, after transfer learning, depend on data and labels from both source and
target tasks. Reuse of features during transfer learning is controlled by an
elastic weight coupling which controls the reliance of the network on features
learned during training on the source task. We apply our theory to linear and
polynomial regression tasks as well as real datasets. Our theory and
experiments reveal interesting interplays between elastic weight coupling,
feature learning strength, dataset size, and source and target task alignment
on the utility of transfer learning.

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ESSA比梯度方法（如GRPO）更快收敛且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: ESSA为LLM对齐提供了一种高效的替代方案，支持大规模模型的稳定训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relying on alignment techniques
to ensure that their outputs match human preferences. Although reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) is the dominant approach, it has high
computational costs, memory requirements, and training instability,
particularly when scaling to larger models. This paper introduces ESSA
(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses
Evolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for
gradient computation. ES is well-suited for LLM alignment due to its favorable
properties, such as high parallelizability, memory efficiency, robustness to
sparse rewards, and fewer data samples required for convergence, especially
when starting from a strong pre-trained policy. Moreover, ES eliminates the
need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, making the alignment process simpler
and more stable. Although ES excels in low-dimensional optimization, it poses a
challenge when applied to high-dimensional LLMs. To address this challenge, we
propose a parameter-efficient architectural modification that reduces the
dimensionality of optimization through low-rank adaptation. We evaluated our
approach on mathematical reasoning tasks with verifiable accuracy-based
metrics, demonstrating that ESSA converges faster and is more data efficient
than gradient-based methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our
findings establish ES as a promising and scalable alternative to gradient-based
alignment, paving the way for efficient post-training of large language models.

effectiveness of adapting Shapley-based attribution to identify influential
retrieved documents in RAG. We compare Shapley with more computationally
tractable approximations and some existing attribution methods for LLM. Our
work aims to: (1) systematically apply established attribution principles to
the RAG document-level setting; (2) quantify how well SHAP approximations can
mirror exact attributions while minimizing costly LLM interactions; and (3)
evaluate their practical explainability in identifying critical documents,
especially under complex inter-document relationships such as redundancy,
complementarity, and synergy. This study seeks to bridge the gap between
powerful attribution techniques and the practical constraints of LLM-based RAG
systems, offering insights into achieving reliable and affordable RAG
explainability.

Key words: PEFT, LoRA, LoSiA, 参数高效, 微调

TL;DR: 论文提出LoSiA和LoSiA-Pro方法，通过动态定位和优化关键参数，减少训练参数和计算开销，提高微调效率和性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）在领域专业化任务中计算效率低、微调性能不理想，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 通过梯度稀疏分析动态定位关键参数子网络，仅优化子网络参数以减少矩阵乘法，提出LoSiA和更快的LoSiA-Pro实现。

Result: LoSiA-Pro比LoRA减少约27%训练延迟，性能接近全微调，且在持续训练中减少遗忘。

Conclusion: LoSiA系列方法在训练效率和性能上表现优异，适用于领域专业化和常识推理任务。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly
reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition
matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in
domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and
sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources
Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes
and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it
identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as
the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by
updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix
multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA,
which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive
evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to
full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain
specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that
LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在许多异常检测任务中，存在影响目标变量的正常性的上下文变量，但这些变量本身并不异常。当前方法未能充分建模不确定性，导致检测效果受限。

Method: 基于异方差高斯过程回归，将Z分数作为随机变量建模，提供反映异常评估可靠性的置信区间。

Result: 在基准数据集和心脏病学的实际应用中，NS在检测准确性和可解释性上优于现有CAD方法。

Conclusion: NS框架通过不确定性驱动的决策过程，在医疗等领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Contextual anomaly detection (CAD) aims to identify anomalies in a target
(behavioral) variable conditioned on a set of contextual variables that
influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves indicators
of anomaly. In many anomaly detection tasks, there exist contextual variables
that influence the normalcy of the target variable but are not themselves
indicators of anomaly. In this work, we propose a novel framework for CAD,
normalcy score (NS), that explicitly models both the aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Built on heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression, our method
regards the Z-score as a random variable, providing confidence intervals that
reflect the reliability of the anomaly assessment. Through experiments on
benchmark datasets and a real-world application in cardiology, we demonstrate
that NS outperforms state-of-the-art CAD methods in both detection accuracy and
interpretability. Moreover, confidence intervals enable an adaptive,
uncertainty-driven decision-making process, which may be very important in
domains such as healthcare.

Result: DOTResize在多种大型语言模型上表现优于现有压缩方法，并显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: DOTResize是一种有效的模型压缩方法，适用于Transformer架构，能够保留并重新分配有用信号。

Abstract: Model compression offers a promising path to reducing the cost and
inaccessibility of large pre-trained models, without significantly compromising
their impressive performance. Large Transformer models, including large
language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve
as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically
target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar
neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal
Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression
method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model
weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we
motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into
the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches
which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the
entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal
across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or
state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform
these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving
measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.

Conclusion: 该模型在资源受限的边缘设备上实现了高精度的自动调制分类，展示了其实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Efficient spectrum utilization is critical to meeting the growing data
demands of modern wireless communication networks. Automatic Modulation
Classification (AMC) plays a key role in enhancing spectrum efficiency by
accurately identifying modulation schemes in received signals-an essential
capability for dynamic spectrum allocation and interference mitigation,
particularly in cognitive radio (CR) systems. With the increasing deployment of
smart edge devices, such as IoT nodes with limited computational and memory
resources, there is a pressing need for lightweight AMC models that balance low
complexity with high classification accuracy. This paper proposes a
low-complexity, lightweight deep learning (DL) AMC model optimized for
resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a dual-path deep residual
shrinkage network (DP-DRSN) with Garrote thresholding for effective signal
denoising and design a compact hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture comprising only
27,000 training parameters. The proposed model achieves average classification
accuracies of 61.20%, 63.78%, and 62.13% on the RML2016.10a, RML2016.10b, and

Abstract: We present Photon Splatting, a physics-guided neural surrogate model for
real-time wireless channel prediction in complex environments. The proposed
framework introduces surface-attached virtual sources, referred to as photons,
which carry directional wave signatures informed by the scene geometry and
transmitter configuration. At runtime, channel impulse responses (CIRs) are
predicted by splatting these photons onto the angular domain of the receiver
using a geodesic rasterizer. The model is trained to learn a physically
grounded representation that maps transmitter-receiver configurations to full
channel responses. Once trained, it generalizes to new transmitter positions,
antenna beam patterns, and mobile receivers without requiring model retraining.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a series of
experiments, from canonical 3D scenes to a complex indoor cafe with 1,000
receivers. Results show 30 millisecond-level inference latency and accurate CIR
predictions across a wide range of configurations. The approach supports
real-time adaptability and interpretability, making it a promising candidate
for wireless digital twin platforms and future 6G network planning.

Result: 在稀疏奖励的困难探索环境中实现了当前最佳的样本效率。

Conclusion: 合理利用专家演示和模拟器资源可以显著提升RL的样本效率，尤其是通过安全性概念指导的起始状态分布选择。

Abstract: A long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL) is of ensuring
sample efficiency, which stems from an inability to explore environments
efficiently. Most attempts at efficient exploration tackle this problem in a
setting where learning begins from scratch, without prior information available
to bootstrap learning. However, such approaches fail to leverage expert
demonstrations and simulators that can reset to arbitrary states. These
affordances are valuable resources that offer enormous potential to guide
exploration and speed up learning. In this paper, we explore how a small number
of expert demonstrations and a simulator allowing arbitrary resets can
accelerate learning during online RL. We find that training with a suitable
choice of an auxiliary start state distribution that may differ from the true
start state distribution of the underlying Markov Decision Process can
significantly improve sample efficiency. We find that using a notion of safety
to inform the choice of this auxiliary distribution significantly accelerates
learning. By using episode length information as a way to operationalize this
notion, we demonstrate state-of-the-art sample efficiency on a sparse-reward
hard-exploration environment.

Method: any4通过学习实现4位权重量化，支持任意数值表示，无需预处理权重或激活。此外，any4还测试了any3和any2在更低比特位下的性能。

Result: 在Llama 2、Llama 3、Mistral和Mixtral等模型上，any4的精度优于其他4位量化方法，并与需要预处理的AWQ和GPTQ竞争。此外，仅需单个样本即可完成校准。

Abstract: We present any4, a learned 4-bit weight quantization solution for large

compared to other related 4-bit numeric representation types: int4, fp4 and
nf4, as evaluated on a range of model sizes, generations and families (Llama 2,
Llama 3, Mistral and Mixtral). While any4 does not require preprocessing of
weights or activations, it is also competitive with orthogonal techniques that
require such preprocessing (e.g., AWQ and GPTQ). We also experiment with any3
and any2 and show competitiveness at lower bits. Additionally, we show that we
can calibrate using a single curated diverse sample rather than hundreds of
samples from a dataset as done in most quantization approaches. We also open
source tinygemm, a latency optimized GPU matrix multiplication library for
LLMs, that implements any4 using a GPU-efficient lookup table strategy along
with other common quantization methods. We open source our code at

Result: 在Tiny ImageNet和ImageNet子集上IGDS显著优于现有方法，尤其在低IPC环境下。

Conclusion: IGDS有效解决低IPC多样性问题，提升数据集蒸馏性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to create a compact dataset that retains essential
information while maintaining model performance. Diffusion models (DMs) have
shown promise for this task but struggle in low images-per-class (IPC)
settings, where generated samples lack diversity. In this paper, we address
this issue from an information-theoretic perspective by identifying two key
types of information that a distilled dataset must preserve: ($i$) prototype
information $\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$, which captures label-relevant features; and
($ii$) contextual information $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$, which preserves intra-class
variability. Here, $(X,Y)$ represents the pair of random variables
corresponding to the input data and its ground truth label, respectively.
Observing that the required contextual information scales with IPC, we propose
maximizing $\mathrm{I}(X;Y) + \beta \mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ during the DM sampling
process, where $\beta$ is IPC-dependent. Since directly computing
$\mathrm{I}(X;Y)$ and $\mathrm{H}(X | Y)$ is intractable, we develop
variational estimations to tightly lower-bound these quantities via a
data-driven approach. Our approach, information-guided diffusion sampling
(IGDS), seamlessly integrates with diffusion models and improves dataset
distillation across all IPC settings. Experiments on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet
subsets show that IGDS significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly
in low-IPC regimes. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: 6G networks promise revolutionary immersive communication experiences
including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and holographic
communications. These applications demand high-dimensional multimodal data
transmission and intelligent data processing in real-time, which is extremely
challenging over resource-limited wireless communication systems. Moreover, a
joint understanding of the environment, context, and user intent is essential
to deliver task-relevant content effectively. This article presents a novel
multimodal large language model (MLLM) integrated semantic communications
framework, termed MLLM-SC, which fully leverages reasoning and generative
capabilities of pre-trained foundation models for context-aware and
task-oriented wireless communication. The MLLM-SC framework adopts a
device-edge collaborative architecture. At the edge, MLLM-empowered semantic
guidance module analyzes multimodal inputs, user intents, and channel
conditions to generate importance-aware attention maps prioritizing
semantically critical information. An importance-aware semantic encoder and a
resource-adaptive semantic decoder are jointly designed and optimized, which
can utilize the semantic guidance for adaptive bandwidth allocation and
high-quality content reconstruction or generation. Extensive case studies on
visual question answering for AR/VR applications and diffusion-driven image
generation validate the effectiveness of MLLM-SC.

Method: 受物理学启发，SOSAE通过惩罚特征向量的幅值和位置索引，结构化地引入稀疏性，从而动态压缩特征空间。

Result: 实验表明，SOSAE将特征空间维度的计算量（FLOPs）减少至其他基线的130分之一，且性能不变。

Conclusion: SOSAE提供了一种高效且性能优越的自编码器特征空间优化方法。

Abstract: The process of tuning the size of the hidden layers for autoencoders has the
benefit of providing optimally compressed representations for the input data.
However, such hyper-parameter tuning process would take a lot of computation
and time effort with grid search as the default option. In this paper, we
introduce the Self-Organization Regularization for Autoencoders that
dynamically adapts the dimensionality of the feature space to the optimal size.
Inspired by physics concepts, Self-Organizing Sparse AutoEncoder (SOSAE)
induces sparsity in feature space in a structured way that permits the
truncation of the non-active part of the feature vector without any loss of
information. This is done by penalizing the autoencoder based on the magnitude
and the positional index of the feature vector dimensions, which during
training constricts the feature space in both terms. Extensive experiments on
various datasets show that our SOSAE can tune the feature space dimensionality
up to 130 times lesser Floating-point Operations (FLOPs) than other baselines
while maintaining the same quality of tuning and performance.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by the heavy reliance of multi-output models
on preset probability distributions and embedded prior knowledge in
non-injective regression tasks, this paper proposes a cycle consistency-based
data-driven training framework. The method jointly optimizes a forward model
{\Phi}: X to Y and a backward model {\Psi}: Y to X, where the cycle consistency
loss is defined as L _cycleb equal L(Y reduce {\Phi}({\Psi}(Y))) (and vice
versa). By minimizing this loss, the framework establishes a closed-loop
mechanism integrating generation and validation phases, eliminating the need
for manual rule design or prior distribution assumptions. Experiments on
normalized synthetic and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves a cycle reconstruction error below 0.003, achieving an
improvement of approximately 30% in evaluation metrics compared to baseline
models without cycle consistency. Furthermore, the framework supports
unsupervised learning and significantly reduces reliance on manual
intervention, demonstrating potential advantages in non-injective regression
tasks.

excels in 1D force signal generation, particularly for high-frequency signals,
achieving >0.85 wavelet coherence through Fourier-domain optimization. By
combining generated signals with machining parameters, prediction accuracy
significantly improves. Experiments with traditional ML (SVR, RF, LSTM) and

performance consistency across diverse platforms remains challenging. We
propose DANCE (Dynamic Architectures with Neural Continuous Evolution), which
reformulates architecture search as a continuous evolution problem through
learning distributions over architectural components. DANCE introduces three
key innovations: a continuous architecture distribution enabling smooth
adaptation, a unified architecture space with learned selection gates for
efficient sampling, and a multi-stage training strategy for effective
deployment optimization. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate
DANCE's effectiveness. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS
approaches in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing search costs.
Under varying computational constraints, DANCE maintains robust performance
while smoothly adapting architectures to different hardware requirements. The

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在幻觉问题，限制了其可信度和应用潜力。现有方法依赖外部工具或多轮推理，效率低下。

Method: 提出SEED方法，包括内知识幻觉识别、蒸馏纯化、Mode-Seeking Evolving蒸馏和幻觉消除适配器。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5等模型上显著减少了幻觉问题，POPE-Random指标的F1分数从81.3提升到88.3。

Conclusion: SEED有效且高效地解决了LVLMs的幻觉问题，为模型自进化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
advancements in numerous areas such as multimedia. However, hallucination
issues significantly limit their credibility and application potential.
Existing mitigation methods typically rely on external tools or the comparison
of multi-round inference, which significantly increase inference time. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SE}lf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{D}istillation
(\textbf{SEED}), which identifies hallucinations within the inner knowledge of
LVLMs, isolates and purges them, and then distills the purified knowledge back
into the model, enabling self-evolution. Furthermore, we identified that
traditional distillation methods are prone to inducing void spaces in the
output space of LVLMs. To address this issue, we propose a Mode-Seeking
Evolving approach, which performs distillation to capture the dominant modes of
the purified knowledge distribution, thereby avoiding the chaotic results that
could emerge from void spaces. Moreover, we introduce a Hallucination
Elimination Adapter, which corrects the dark knowledge of the original model by
learning purified knowledge. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks
validate the superiority of our SEED, demonstrating substantial improvements in
mitigating hallucinations for representative LVLM models such as LLaVA-1.5 and
InternVL2. Remarkably, the F1 score of LLaVA-1.5 on the hallucination
evaluation metric POPE-Random improved from 81.3 to 88.3.

Key words: 塑性损失, 权重增长, SWR, 神经网络, 图像分类

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为软权重重新缩放（SWR）的方法，用于防止神经网络训练中的权重无界增长问题，从而避免塑性损失。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有研究表明，神经网络的权重无界增长会引发塑性损失，影响泛化能力和优化动态。传统的网络重新初始化方法会导致已学信息丢失。

Method: 提出软权重重新缩放（SWR），通过在训练过程中逐步缩放权重，防止权重无界增长。理论上证明了该方法能够限制权重大小并平衡层间权重。

Result: 实验表明，SWR在热启动学习、持续学习和单任务学习等多种学习范式下，均能提升标准图像分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: SWR是一种有效的解决塑性损失的方法，能够在不同学习场景中提升性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that as training progresses, neural networks
gradually lose their capacity to learn new information, a phenomenon known as
plasticity loss. An unbounded weight growth is one of the main causes of
plasticity loss. Furthermore, it harms generalization capability and disrupts
optimization dynamics. Re-initializing the network can be a solution, but it
results in the loss of learned information, leading to performance drops. In
this paper, we propose Soft Weight Rescaling (SWR), a novel approach that
prevents unbounded weight growth without losing information. SWR recovers the
plasticity of the network by simply scaling down the weight at each step of the
learning process. We theoretically prove that SWR bounds weight magnitude and
balances weight magnitude between layers. Our experiment shows that SWR
improves performance on warm-start learning, continual learning, and
single-task learning setups on standard image classification benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决KAN网络的局限性，如高计算成本和分类任务性能不足。

Method: 集成FiLM机制和RBF激活函数，构建混合架构。

Result: 在函数回归中表现优于MLP，图像和文本分类中性能与MLP相当，但需谨慎调整基函数数量。

Conclusion: MJKAN兼具KAN的理论优势和高效实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have garnered attention for replacing fixed
activation functions with learnable univariate functions, but they exhibit
practical limitations, including high computational costs and performance
deficits in general classification tasks. In this paper, we propose the
Modulation Joint KAN (MJKAN), a novel neural network layer designed to overcome
these challenges. MJKAN integrates a FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)-like
mechanism with Radial Basis Function (RBF) activations, creating a hybrid
architecture that combines the non-linear expressive power of KANs with the
efficiency of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We empirically validated MJKAN's
performance across a diverse set of benchmarks, including function regression,
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100), and natural language processing (AG
News, SMS Spam). The results demonstrate that MJKAN achieves superior
approximation capabilities in function regression tasks, significantly
outperforming MLPs, with performance improving as the number of basis functions
increases. Conversely, in image and text classification, its performance was
competitive with MLPs but revealed a critical dependency on the number of basis
functions. We found that a smaller basis size was crucial for better
generalization, highlighting that the model's capacity must be carefully tuned
to the complexity of the data to prevent overfitting. In conclusion, MJKAN
offers a flexible architecture that inherits the theoretical advantages of KANs
while improving computational efficiency and practical viability.

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上表现出优于基线方法的可解释性和样本效率。

Conclusion: CB-RM为更透明、可审计且与人对齐的奖励模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce Concept Bottleneck Reward Models (CB-RM), a reward modeling
framework that enables interpretable preference learning through selective
concept annotation. Unlike standard RLHF methods that rely on opaque reward
functions, CB-RM decomposes reward prediction into human-interpretable
concepts. To make this framework efficient in low-supervision settings, we
formalize an active learning strategy that dynamically acquires the most
informative concept labels. We propose an acquisition function based on
Expected Information Gain and show that it significantly accelerates concept
learning without compromising preference accuracy. Evaluated on the
UltraFeedback dataset, our method outperforms baselines in interpretability and
sample efficiency, marking a step towards more transparent, auditable, and
human-aligned reward models.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在BLAS代码生成任务中表现出色，能够有效生成并优化代码。

Abstract: Generative AI technology based on Large Language Models (LLM) has been
developed and applied to assist or automatically generate program codes. In
this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs
provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model,
and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released
in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate
(1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic
performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and
cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance
optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that
correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are
given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD
vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that
the code is faster than the reference code.

Result: 在多种复杂度的真实城市任务中验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为实现未来城市环境中的通用LLM智能体迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Urban general intelligence (UGI) refers to the capacity of AI systems to
autonomously perceive, reason, and act within dynamic and complex urban
environments. In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.
Central to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual
Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates
domain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term
adaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel
optimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent
sub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either
independently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework
is highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise
optimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive
under data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating
mechanism. Evaluations on real-world urban tasks of a variety of complexity
verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This work presents a
promising step toward the realization of general-purpose LLM agents in future
urban environments.

toy localization task with a convolutional architecture and show that
normalization layers enable an iterative message passing procedure, allowing
information aggregation from well outside the local receptive field. Our
results suggest that normalization layers should be employed with caution in
applications such as diffusion-based trajectory generation, where maintaining a
spatially limited receptive field is crucial.

Conclusion: ABench-Physics为提升LLMs的科学推理能力提供了挑战性诊断框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Method: 采用原型对抗学习统一特征空间，通过协作学习强化特征中的类别信息，并利用全局原型与局部特征的混合特征增强全局分类器。

Result: 在三个特征漂移数据集上的评估表明，FedPall在FL场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: FedPall能有效应对特征漂移，提升联邦学习模型的分类性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a global model in
the centralized server with data from multiple parties while preserving
privacy. However, data heterogeneity can significantly degrade the performance
of the global model when each party uses datasets from different sources to
train a local model, thereby affecting personalized local models. Among various
cases of data heterogeneity, feature drift, feature space difference among
parties, is prevalent in real-life data but remains largely unexplored. Feature
drift can distract feature extraction learning in clients and thus lead to poor
feature extraction and classification performance. To tackle the problem of
feature drift in FL, we propose FedPall, an FL framework that utilizes
prototype-based adversarial learning to unify feature spaces and collaborative
learning to reinforce class information within the features. Moreover, FedPall
leverages mixed features generated from global prototypes and local features to
enhance the global classifier with classification-relevant information from a
global perspective. Evaluation results on three representative feature-drifted
datasets demonstrate FedPall's consistently superior performance in
classification with feature-drifted data in the FL scenario.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 大规模标记数据的获取和训练成本高，而小数据集可能导致模型结果不稳定、过拟合和虚假相关性学习。现有数据标签缺乏分类依据的说明，使模型可能学习任意分类规则。

Method: 采用两阶段训练循环，交替提升模型预测精度和优化其注意力以匹配解释信号，从而帮助模型理解标签分配背后的逻辑。

Result: 该方法加速了模型收敛，使模型在小数据、类别不平衡或具有虚假特征的数据上表现更准确可靠。

Conclusion: 通过结合解释信号的两阶段训练，可以有效提升小数据集上分类模型的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Acquiring and training on large-scale labeled data can be impractical due to
cost constraints. Additionally, the use of small training datasets can result
in considerable variability in model outcomes, overfitting, and learning of
spurious correlations. A crucial shortcoming of data labels is their lack of
any reasoning behind a specific label assignment, causing models to learn any
arbitrary classification rule as long as it aligns data with labels. To
overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative approach for training
reliable classification models on smaller datasets, by using simple explanation
signals such as important input features from labeled data. Our method centers
around a two-stage training cycle that alternates between enhancing model
prediction accuracy and refining its attention to match the explanations. This
instructs models to grasp the rationale behind label assignments during their
learning phase. We demonstrate that our training cycle expedites the
convergence towards more accurate and reliable models, particularly for small,
class-imbalanced training data, or data with spurious features.

Abstract: The growing adoption of domain-specific architectures in edge computing
platforms for deep learning has highlighted the efficiency of hardware
accelerators. However, integrating custom accelerators into modern machine
learning (ML) compilers remains a complex challenge due to the need for
significant modifications in compilation layers and specialized scheduling
techniques. Existing frameworks offer partial solutions and require users to
navigate intricate compiler internals.
  In this paper, we introduce a TVM-based compilation integration approach that
targets GEMM-based deep learning accelerators. Our approach abstracts the
complexities of compiler integration, enabling seamless integration of
accelerators without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying compiler.
Furthermore, we extend and incorporate design space exploration tools,
specifically CoSA, to automate efficient tensor scheduling, accounting for
factors such as uneven mapping and double buffering. Our framework is
benchmarked on the Gemmini accelerator, demonstrating performance comparable to
its specialized manually implemented toolchain.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have demonstrated great promise in modeling various
sequence data, ranging from human language to biological sequences. Inspired by
the success of RL in language models, there is growing interest in further
improving the models by alignment with a certain reward. In this work, we
propose a novel preference optimization method for masked discrete diffusion
models through a principled diffusion trajectory alignment. Instead of applying
the reward on the final output and backpropagating the gradient to the entire
discrete denoising process, we decompose the problem into a set of stepwise
alignment objectives. This framework enables efficient diffusion optimization,
is compatible with arbitrary reward functions, and importantly, guarantees an
equivalent optimal solution under additive factorization of the trajectory
reward. Experiments across multiple domains including DNA sequence design,
protein inverse folding, and language modeling consistently demonstrate the
superiority of our approach. Notably, it achieves an up to 12\% improvement
over the most competitive RL-based baseline in terms of predicted activity on
DNA sequence design, and further improves the GSM8K score from 78.6 to 80.7 on
LLaDA-8B-Instruct for language modeling.

Conclusion: NTSFormer通过自学习和多模态融合，有效提升了冷启动节点的分类性能。

Abstract: Cold-start node classification on multimodal graphs is challenging because
cold-start nodes are isolated (i.e., no edges) and often have missing
modalities (e.g., absent text or image features). Existing methods address
structural isolation by degrading graph learning models to MLPs for cold-start
inference, using a teacher model (with graph access) to guide the MLP. However,
this results in limited model capacity in the student, which is further
challenged when modalities are missing. In this paper, we propose
Neighbor-to-Self Graph Transformer (NTSFormer), a unified Graph Transformer
framework that jointly tackles the isolation and missing-modality issues via a
self-teaching paradigm. Specifically, NTSFormer uses a cold-start attention
mask to simultaneously make two predictions for each node: a "student"
prediction based only on self-information (i.e., the node's own features), and
a "teacher" prediction incorporating both self and neighbor information. This
enables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby
fully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To
handle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a
one-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature
data into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.
Experimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior
performance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks.

Result: 在六种Atari环境中实验证明，两种攻击方法与现有训练时攻击效果相当，且能绕过主流防御。

Conclusion: 研究突显了当前防御措施的不足，亟需更鲁棒的安全方案。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) systems are increasingly used in
safety-critical applications, yet their security remains severely
underexplored. This work investigates backdoor attacks, which implant hidden
triggers that cause malicious actions only when specific inputs appear in the
observation space. Existing DRL backdoor research focuses solely on
training-time attacks requiring unrealistic access to the training pipeline. In
contrast, we reveal critical vulnerabilities across the DRL supply chain where
backdoors can be embedded with significantly reduced adversarial privileges. We
introduce two novel attacks: (1) TrojanentRL, which exploits component-level
flaws to implant a persistent backdoor that survives full model retraining; and
(2) InfrectroRL, a post-training backdoor attack which requires no access to
training, validation, nor test data. Empirical and analytical evaluations
across six Atari environments show our attacks rival state-of-the-art
training-time backdoor attacks while operating under much stricter adversarial
constraints. We also demonstrate that InfrectroRL further evades two leading
DRL backdoor defenses. These findings challenge the current research focus and
highlight the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,

a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and
data-efficient method for instilling specific stylistic behaviors, offering a
preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications
requiring nuanced response styles.

Result: 模型能处理多条件任务，并在推理时适应对象数量和轨迹长度的变化。

Conclusion: 该架构高效灵活，适用于复杂物理推理任务。

Abstract: Reasoning about the trajectories of multiple, interacting objects is integral
to physical reasoning tasks in machine learning. This involves conditions
imposed on the objects at different time steps, for instance initial states or
desired goal states. Existing approaches in physical reasoning generally rely
on autoregressive modeling, which can only be conditioned on initial states,
but not on later states. In fields such as planning for reinforcement learning,
similar challenges are being addressed with denoising diffusion models. In this
work, we propose an object-centric denoising diffusion model architecture for
physical reasoning that is translation equivariant over time, permutation
equivariant over objects, and can be conditioned on arbitrary time steps for
arbitrary objects. We demonstrate how this model can solve tasks with multiple
conditions and examine its performance when changing object numbers and
trajectory lengths during inference.

Result: 实验表明，新策略能够减少主动学习迭代次数和获取成本，并在某些情况下优于无约束基线。

Conclusion: ConBatch-BAL在实际具有成本和地理约束的场景中表现出色，为主动学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Varying annotation costs among data points and budget constraints can hinder
the adoption of active learning strategies in real-world applications. This
work introduces two Bayesian active learning strategies for batch acquisition
under constraints (ConBatch-BAL), one based on dynamic thresholding and one
following greedy acquisition. Both select samples using uncertainty metrics
computed via Bayesian neural networks. The dynamic thresholding strategy
redistributes the budget across the batch, while the greedy one selects the
top-ranked sample at each step, limited by the remaining budget. Focusing on
scenarios with costly data annotation and geospatial constraints, we also
release two new real-world datasets containing geolocated aerial images of
buildings, annotated with energy efficiency or typology classes. The
ConBatch-BAL strategies are benchmarked against a random acquisition baseline
on these datasets under various budget and cost scenarios. The results show
that the developed ConBatch-BAL strategies can reduce active learning
iterations and data acquisition costs in real-world settings, and even
outperform the unconstrained baseline solutions.

Result: 模型在SLE和RA诊断中AUC分别达98.95%和97.76%，能识别疾病相关基因并区分严重程度。

Conclusion: EAMil为自身免疫病检测提供了新工具，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires encode critical immunological signatures
for autoimmune diseases, yet their clinical application remains limited by
sequence sparsity and low witness rates. We developed EAMil, a multi-instance
deep learning framework that leverages TCR sequencing data to diagnose systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with exceptional
accuracy. By integrating PrimeSeq feature extraction with ESMonehot encoding
and enhanced gate attention mechanisms, our model achieved state-of-the-art
performance with AUCs of 98.95% for SLE and 97.76% for RA. EAMil successfully
identified disease-associated genes with over 90% concordance with established
differential analyses and effectively distinguished disease-specific TCR genes.
The model demonstrated robustness in classifying multiple disease categories,
utilizing the SLEDAI score to stratify SLE patients by disease severity as well
as to diagnose the site of damage in SLE patients, and effectively controlling
for confounding factors such as age and gender. This interpretable framework
for immune receptor analysis provides new insights for autoimmune disease
detection and classification with broad potential clinical applications across
immune-mediated conditions.

Abstract: In-context learning enables transformer models to generalize to new tasks
based solely on input prompts, without any need for weight updates. However,
existing training paradigms typically rely on large, unstructured datasets that
are costly to store, difficult to evaluate for quality and balance, and pose
privacy and ethical concerns due to the inclusion of sensitive information.
Motivated by these limitations and risks, we propose an alternative training
strategy where we leverage a collection of multiple, small-scale, and
domain-specific datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the increased quality
and diversity of such data improve the generalization abilities of in-context
learners beyond their training domain, while achieving comparable performance
with models trained on a single large-scale dataset. We investigate this
paradigm by leveraging meta-learning to train an in-context learner on the
Meta-Album collection under several settings. Firstly, we show the performance
in a controlled environment, where the test domain is completely excluded from
the training knowledge. Secondly, we explore the robustness of these models to
forgetting in a continual scenario where the information is accessible for a
limited time. Finally, we explore the more challenging unsupervised scenario.
Our findings demonstrate that transformers still generalize for in-context
prediction when trained on a curated dataset collection while offering
advantages in modularity and replaceability.

Result: 发现尽管内部模型动态行为相反，但性能扩展指数可能相似；量化了核驱动与特征驱动扩展模式之间的过渡，并确定了支持特征学习的最大模型宽度。

Conclusion: 性能扩展本身不足以解释神经网络的机制，研究为理解有限宽度模型的扩展行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the relationship between neural
network performance and computational cost, yet their underlying mechanisms
remain poorly understood. In this work, we empirically analyze how neural
networks behave under data and model scaling through the lens of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK). This analysis establishes a link between performance
scaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard
vision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even
though the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates
that performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying
mechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in
neural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling
behavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature
learning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition
between kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes. We identify the
maximum model width that supports feature learning, which, in our setups, we
find to be more than ten times smaller than typical large language model
widths.

Conclusion: 多轮交互设计为大型语言模型在推理时高效利用额外计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances have established a new machine learning paradigm based on
scaling up compute at inference time as well as at training time. In that line
of work, a combination of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic
demonstrations and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is
used for training Large Language Models to expend extra compute during
inference in the form of "thoughts" expressed in natural language. In this
paper, we propose to instead format these tokens as a multi-turn interaction
trace with a stateful tool. At each turn, the new state of the tool is appended
to the context of the model, whose job is to generate the tokens necessary to
control the tool via a custom DSL. We benchmark this approach on the problem of
repairing malfunctioning Python code, and show that this constrained setup
allows for faster sampling of experience and a denser reward signal, allowing
even models of size up to 3B parameters to learn how to proficiently expend
additional compute on the task.

Result: 在数据分布较“好”时，泛化误差界不随维度增加而恶化，且优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 在特定分布假设下，本文方法显著提升了高维数据的泛化性能。

Abstract: Modern regression problems often involve high-dimensional data and a careful
tuning of the regularization hyperparameters is crucial to avoid overly complex
models that may overfit the training data while guaranteeing desirable
properties like effective variable selection. We study the recently introduced
direction of tuning regularization hyperparameters in linear regression across
multiple related tasks. We obtain distribution-dependent bounds on the
generalization error for the validation loss when tuning the L1 and L2
coefficients, including ridge, lasso and the elastic net. In contrast, prior
work develops bounds that apply uniformly to all distributions, but such bounds
necessarily degrade with feature dimension, d. While these bounds are shown to
be tight for worst-case distributions, our bounds improve with the "niceness"
of the data distribution. Concretely, we show that under additional assumptions
that instances within each task are i.i.d. draws from broad well-studied
classes of distributions including sub-Gaussians, our generalization bounds do
not get worse with increasing d, and are much sharper than prior work for very
large d. We also extend our results to a generalization of ridge regression,
where we achieve tighter bounds that take into account an estimate of the mean
of the ground truth distribution.

Conclusion: 该方法可服务于自动驾驶测试中场景的高效选择，提升测试的多样性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is an indispensable instrument for the comprehensive
validation and verification of automated vehicles (AVs). However, finding a
manageable and finite, yet representative subset of scenarios in a scalable,
possibly unsupervised manner is notoriously challenging. Our work is meant to
constitute a cornerstone to facilitate sample-efficient testing, while still
capturing the diversity of relevant operational design domains (ODDs) and
accounting for the "long tail" phenomenon in particular. To this end, we first
propose an expressive and flexible heterogeneous, spatio-temporal graph model
for representing traffic scenarios. Leveraging recent advances of graph neural
networks (GNNs), we then propose a self-supervised method to learn a universal
embedding space for scenario graphs that enables clustering and similarity
search. In particular, we implement contrastive learning alongside a
bootstrapping-based approach and evaluate their suitability for partitioning
the scenario space. Experiments on the nuPlan dataset confirm the model's
ability to capture semantics and thus group related scenarios in a meaningful
way despite the absence of discrete class labels. Different scenario types
materialize as distinct clusters. Our results demonstrate how variable-length
traffic scenarios can be condensed into single vector representations that
enable nearest-neighbor retrieval of representative candidates for distinct
scenario categories. Notably, this is achieved without manual labeling or bias
towards an explicit objective such as criticality. Ultimately, our approach can
serve as a basis for scalable selection of scenarios to further enhance the
efficiency and robustness of testing AVs in simulation.

Method: PRING 提供了一个高质量的多物种PPI网络数据集，并设计了两种互补的评估范式：拓扑导向和功能导向任务。

Result: 研究表明当前PPI模型在恢复PPI网络的结构和功能特性上存在局限性。

Conclusion: PRING为开发更有效的PPI预测模型提供了可靠平台。

Abstract: Deep learning-based computational methods have achieved promising results in
predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs). However, existing benchmarks
predominantly focus on isolated pairwise evaluations, overlooking a model's
capability to reconstruct biologically meaningful PPI networks, which is
crucial for biology research. To address this gap, we introduce PRING, the
first comprehensive benchmark that evaluates protein-protein interaction
prediction from a graph-level perspective. PRING curates a high-quality,
multi-species PPI network dataset comprising 21,484 proteins and 186,818
interactions, with well-designed strategies to address both data redundancy and
leakage. Building on this golden-standard dataset, we establish two
complementary evaluation paradigms: (1) topology-oriented tasks, which assess
intra and cross-species PPI network construction, and (2) function-oriented
tasks, including protein complex pathway prediction, GO module analysis, and
essential protein justification. These evaluations not only reflect the model's
capability to understand the network topology but also facilitate protein
function annotation, biological module detection, and even disease mechanism
analysis. Extensive experiments on four representative model categories,
consisting of sequence similarity-based, naive sequence-based, protein language
model-based, and structure-based approaches, demonstrate that current PPI
models have potential limitations in recovering both structural and functional
properties of PPI networks, highlighting the gap in supporting real-world
biological applications. We believe PRING provides a reliable platform to guide
the development of more effective PPI prediction models for the community. The
dataset and source code of PRING are available at

Motivation: 为了高效且稳定地学习种群动态，避免传统方法在训练中因时间条件限制而带来的高成本和复杂性。

Method: 开发了一种离散反向连续性方程（DICE）方法，其损失函数对时空常数具有不变性，提升了训练稳定性，并直接生成时间区间内的样本轨迹。

Result: DICE在训练稳定性和生成样本效率上优于传统方法，且计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: DICE为学习复杂随机过程的种群动态提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Inverse Continuity Equation (DICE) method, a
generative modeling approach that learns the evolution of a stochastic process
from given sample populations at a finite number of time points. Models learned
with DICE capture the typically smooth and well-behaved population dynamics,
rather than the dynamics of individual sample trajectories that can exhibit
complex or even chaotic behavior. The DICE loss function is developed
specifically to be invariant, even in discrete time, to spatially constant but
time-varying spurious constants that can emerge during training; this
invariance increases training stability and robustness. Generating a trajectory
of sample populations with DICE is fast because samples evolve directly in the
time interval over which the stochastic process is formulated, in contrast to
approaches that condition on time and then require multiple sampling steps per
time step. DICE is stable to train, in situations where other methods for
learning population dynamics fail, and DICE generates representative samples
with orders of magnitude lower costs than methods that have to condition on
time. Numerical experiments on a wide range of problems from random waves,
Vlasov-Poisson instabilities and high-dimensional chaos are included to justify
these assertions.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision
learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)
AGI system enabled by such a model.

Conclusion: 该教程有助于初学者深入理解KFAC，并降低其在实践中的使用难度。

Abstract: Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (KFAC) is arguably one of the most
prominent curvature approximations in deep learning. Its applications range
from optimization to Bayesian deep learning, training data attribution with
influence functions, and model compression or merging. While the intuition
behind KFAC is easy to understand, its implementation is tedious: It comes in
many flavours, has common pitfalls when translating the math to code, and is
challenging to test, which complicates ensuring a properly functioning
implementation. Some of the authors themselves have dealt with these challenges
and experienced the discomfort of not being able to fully test their code.
Thanks to recent advances in understanding KFAC, we are now able to provide
test cases and a recipe for a reliable KFAC implementation. This tutorial is
meant as a ground-up introduction to KFAC. In contrast to the existing work,
our focus lies on providing both math and code side-by-side and providing test
cases based on the latest insights into KFAC that are scattered throughout the
literature. We hope this tutorial provides a contemporary view of KFAC that
allows beginners to gain a deeper understanding of this curvature approximation
while lowering the barrier to its implementation, extension, and usage in
practice.

Abstract: We present a deep learning approach to extract physical parameters (e.g.,
mobility, Schottky contact barrier height, defect profiles) of two-dimensional
(2D) transistors from electrical measurements, enabling automated parameter
extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural
network on electrical data generated from physics-based simulations of ~500
devices, a factor >40$\times$ fewer than other recent efforts. Consequently,
fitting can be achieved by training on physically rigorous TCAD models,
including complex geometry, self-consistent transport, and electrostatic
effects, and is not limited to computationally inexpensive compact models. We
apply our approach to reverse-engineer key parameters from experimental
monolayer WS$_2$ transistors, achieving a median coefficient of determination
($R^2$) = 0.99 when fitting measured electrical data. We also demonstrate that
this approach generalizes and scales well by reverse-engineering electrical
data on high-electron-mobility transistors while fitting 35 parameters
simultaneously. To facilitate future research on deep learning approaches for
inverse transistor design, we have published our code and sample data sets
online.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 神经符号AI（NSAI）可以弥补深度学习模型的不足，如量化不确定性和显式推理，但现有TinyML硬件对符号模型的支持不足，限制了其在嵌入式场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了一种框架，包括：（1）训练硬件高效的确定性概率电路（PCs）；（2）使用n次根压缩技术压缩PC模型以适应TinyML硬件；（3）将完整的NSAI模型部署到TinyML硬件上。

Result: 与64位精度的基准相比，该框架在FPGA上显著减少了硬件资源（FF减少82.3%，LUT减少52.6%，Flash使用减少18.0%），并在ESP32微控制器上实现了平均4.67倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: 该框架通过硬件/软件协同设计，成功解决了符号模型在资源受限硬件上的计算瓶颈，为NSAI在嵌入式场景中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) has recently emerged to mitigate limitations
associated with deep learning (DL) models, e.g. quantifying their uncertainty
or reason with explicit rules. Hence, TinyML hardware will need to support
these symbolic models to bring NSAI to embedded scenarios. Yet, although
symbolic models are typically compact, their sparsity and computation
resolution contrasts with low-resolution and dense neuro models, which is a
challenge on resource-constrained TinyML hardware severely limiting the size of
symbolic models that can be computed. In this work, we remove this bottleneck
leveraging a tight hardware/software integration to present a complete
framework to compute NSAI with TinyML hardware. We focus on symbolic models
realized with tractable probabilistic circuits (PCs), a popular subclass of
probabilistic models for hardware integration. This framework: (1) trains a
specific class of hardware-efficient \emph{deterministic} PCs, chosen for the
symbolic task; (2) \emph{compresses} this PC until it can be computed on TinyML
hardware with minimal accuracy degradation, using our $n^{th}$-root compression
technique, and (3) \emph{deploys} the complete NSAI model on TinyML hardware.
Compared to a 64b precision baseline necessary for the PC without compression,
our workflow leads to significant hardware reduction on FPGA (up to 82.3\% in
FF, 52.6\% in LUTs, and 18.0\% in Flash usage) and an average inference speedup

### [344] [Logit Reweighting for Topic-Focused Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05235)
*Joschka Braun,Bálint Mucsányi,Seyed Ali Bahrainian*

Key words: 摘要生成, 主题相关性, logits重新加权, 轻量级方法

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过直接重新加权主题相关标记的logits来提升摘要的主题相关性，避免了传统微调的资源消耗。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 生成符合特定主题的摘要仍是一个挑战，传统方法如微调资源密集，提示工程难以保持主题焦点。

Method: 提出三种重新加权技术：恒定偏移、因子缩放和阈值选择，以增强主题相关性。

Result: 在NEWTS数据集上，阈值选择方法显著提升了主题焦点且未降低摘要质量。

Conclusion: 直接重新加权logits是一种高效且实用的替代微调方法，能精确控制生成文本的主题内容。

Abstract: Generating abstractive summaries that adhere to a specific topic remains a
significant challenge for language models. While standard approaches, such as
fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering
often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To
address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance
by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation.
We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a
constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor;
and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a
probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset,
using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques
effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the
Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without
compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches. Our
findings demonstrate that directly reweighting logits is a practical and
resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, offering a promising pathway for
precisely controlling the thematic content of generated text.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 目标是为同时包含连续和分类分量的随机变量构建随机场模型，并量化不确定性。

Method: 采用广义Wasserstein-2距离度量，设计了一种广义局部平方Wasserstein-2损失函数来高效训练随机神经网络。

Result: 随机神经网络可以在非限制条件下近似随机场模型，并在分类、混合随机变量分布重建等任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 所提方法在不确定性量化任务中具有高效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generalized Wasserstein-2 distance approach
for efficiently training stochastic neural networks to reconstruct random field
models, where the target random variable comprises both continuous and
categorical components. We prove that a stochastic neural network can
approximate random field models under a Wasserstein-2 distance metric under
nonrestrictive conditions. Furthermore, this stochastic neural network can be
efficiently trained by minimizing our proposed generalized local squared
Wasserstein-2 loss function. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed
approach in various uncertainty quantification tasks, including classification,
reconstructing the distribution of mixed random variables, and learning complex
noisy dynamical systems from spatiotemporal data.

Key words: 语言模型, 基准测试, 训练-测试前, 排名一致性

TL;DR: 论文提出通过“训练-测试前”方法显著改善语言模型基准测试的排名一致性，支持将其作为默认的LLM评估组件。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有语言模型基准测试中模型排名存在矛盾，阻碍模型选择和比较，因此需要一种解决方案统一排名。

Method: 采用“训练-测试前”方法，对61个模型在24个基准测试上进行统一的微调后再评估。

Result: 该方法显著提高了排名一致性，并揭示了基准性能的潜在因素。

Conclusion: 建议将“训练-测试前”作为语言模型基准测试的默认组成部分。

Abstract: Existing language model benchmarks provide contradictory model rankings, even
for benchmarks that aim to capture similar skills. This dilemma of conflicting
rankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion
to a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking
disagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,
different models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test
task. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model
the same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary
contribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24
benchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves
ranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have
little external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of
external validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer
gracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,
train-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect
agreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to
essentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of
benchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make
train-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking.

TL;DR: 本文主张从预测范式转向干预范式，以更全面地评估自动化决策系统（ADS）对社会系统的影响。

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前ADS设计过于关注预测问题，忽略了其在现实部署中作为政策干预工具的作用及其对社会系统的长期影响。

Method: 提出从预测为中心转向干预为中心的范式，将预测视为决策支持、最终决策和结果的综合部分，并统一现代统计框架和其他工具。

Result: 突出了预测孤岛任务的局限性，并提出了一个更干预导向的ADS开发和部署方法。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究以操作化这一范式转变，并推动ADS设计和评估的更全面视角。

Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction
problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population
and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these
prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment.
Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective
policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past
and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing
organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work,
we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm
to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social
systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond
prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final
decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern
statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to
operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the
limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation
for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 机器学习模型的预测可以补充稀缺数据，但现有工具仅适用于均值或单一分位数，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出QuEst框架，支持多种分位度量，并提供置信区间，扩展到多维度量并引入优化技术降低方差。

Result: 实验证明QuEst在经济建模、民意调查和语言模型自评估中具有实用性。

Conclusion: QuEst为多领域提供了一种灵活的统计推断工具，填补了现有方法的空白。

Abstract: As machine learning models grow increasingly competent, their predictions can
supplement scarce or expensive data in various important domains. In support of
this paradigm, algorithms have emerged to combine a small amount of
high-fidelity observed data with a much larger set of imputed model outputs to
estimate some quantity of interest. Yet current hybrid-inference tools target
only means or single quantiles, limiting their applicability for many critical
domains and use cases. We present QuEst, a principled framework to merge
observed and imputed data to deliver point estimates and rigorous confidence
intervals for a wide family of quantile-based distributional measures. QuEst
covers a range of measures, from tail risk (CVaR) to population segments such
as quartiles, that are central to fields such as economics, sociology,
education, medicine, and more. We extend QuEst to multidimensional metrics, and
introduce an additional optimization technique to further reduce variance in
this and other hybrid estimators. We demonstrate the utility of our framework
through experiments in economic modeling, opinion polling, and language model
auto-evaluation.

Key words: LLM, 第三方推理, 隐私保护, Cascade协议, 序列分片

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cascade的新型多方推理协议，通过序列维度分片来保护隐私，牺牲部分密码学隐私保证以提升性能和可扩展性，显著优于现有方案。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 随着LLM参数规模增长，计算资源需求导致第三方推理服务流行，但数据隐私问题突出。现有安全方案如SMPC成本高且无法扩展，亟需高效替代方案。

Method: 利用序列维度分片技术设计Cascade协议，在隐私保证与性能之间取得平衡，避免SMPC的高昂开销。

Result: Cascade能抵御最新攻击及其他基于学习的攻击，计算速度较现有方案快数个数量级。

Conclusion: Cascade为现代LLM的安全部署提供了实用解决方案，兼顾隐私与效率。

Abstract: As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.

Motivation: 传统GWAS方法在捕捉非线性遗传交互作用方面存在不足，深度学习虽然提供了新机会，但现有方法在特征选择和协变量处理上存在问题。

Method: 研究比较了不同的深度学习架构选择，并扩展为多标签框架，联合建模五种疾病，利用共享遗传架构提升效率。

Result: 在37,000样本和五百万SNPs上，该方法实现了0.68-0.96的AUC，预测性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为多疾病GWAS分析提供了一种可扩展、无泄漏且具有生物学意义的新途径。

Abstract: Traditional GWAS has advanced our understanding of complex diseases but often
misses nonlinear genetic interactions. Deep learning offers new opportunities
to capture complex genomic patterns, yet existing methods mostly depend on
feature selection strategies that either constrain analysis to known pathways
or risk data leakage when applied across the full dataset. Further, covariates
can inflate predictive performance without reflecting true genetic signals. We
explore different deep learning architecture choices for GWAS and demonstrate
that careful architectural choices can outperform existing methods under strict
no-leakage conditions. Building on this, we extend our approach to a
multi-label framework that jointly models five diseases, leveraging shared
genetic architecture for improved efficiency and discovery. Applied to five
million SNPs across 37,000 samples, our method achieves competitive predictive
performance (AUC 0.68-0.96), offering a scalable, leakage-free, and
biologically meaningful approach for multi-disease GWAS analysis.

Abstract: Algorithms are the engine for reproducible problem-solving. We present a
framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences
of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained
using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated
procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement
learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens.
This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that
substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as
Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the
computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces
algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely
classes.

Motivation: 手动设计系统指令 (SIs) 资源消耗大且效果不佳，现有的自动化方法生成的提示难以理解。需要一种既能保持可读性又能提升性能的新方法。

Method: SI-Agent 由三个协作智能体组成：Instructor Agent（生成指令）、Instruction Follower Agent（执行任务）、Feedback/Reward Agent（评估性能与可读性）。通过迭代循环和反馈优化指令。

Result: 实验证明 SI-Agent 能生成高效且易读的 SIs，在性能和可解释性之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: SI-Agent 为 LLM 定制化和透明度提供了新途径，但计算成本和反馈可靠性仍需改进。

Abstract: System Instructions (SIs), or system prompts, are pivotal for guiding Large
Language Models (LLMs) but manual crafting is resource-intensive and often
suboptimal. Existing automated methods frequently generate non-human-readable
"soft prompts," sacrificing interpretability. This paper introduces SI-Agent, a
novel agentic framework designed to automatically generate and iteratively
refine human-readable SIs through a feedback-driven loop. SI-Agent employs
three collaborating agents: an Instructor Agent, an Instruction Follower Agent
(target LLM), and a Feedback/Reward Agent evaluating task performance and
optionally SI readability. The framework utilizes iterative cycles where
feedback guides the Instructor's refinement strategy (e.g., LLM-based editing,
evolutionary algorithms). We detail the framework's architecture, agent roles,
the iterative refinement process, and contrast it with existing methods. We
present experimental results validating SI-Agent's effectiveness, focusing on
metrics for task performance, SI readability, and efficiency. Our findings
indicate that SI-Agent generates effective, readable SIs, offering a favorable
trade-off between performance and interpretability compared to baselines.
Potential implications include democratizing LLM customization and enhancing
model transparency. Challenges related to computational cost and feedback
reliability are acknowledged.

Result: 在SAP数据集上表现优于传统RAG方法，性能接近LLM生成的知识图，同时显著降低成本。

Conclusion: GraphRAG框架证明了在大规模企业应用中部署的可行性，兼具成本效益和可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While
GraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,
its adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing
knowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of
graph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core
innovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that
leverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from
unstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a
lightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node
identification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency
subgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on
legacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system
achieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based
on LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based
construction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge
graphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving
scalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG
systems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring
prohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,
and domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: CodeAgents显著提升多代理系统的规划能力和效率，证实令牌感知评估的重要性。

Abstract: Effective prompt design is essential for improving the planning capabilities
of large language model (LLM)-driven agents. However, existing structured
prompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,
and often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking
critical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in
multi-agent environments. To address these limitations, we introduce
CodeAgents, a prompting framework that codifies multi-agent reasoning and
enables structured, token-efficient planning in multi-agent systems. In
CodeAgents, all components of agent interaction - Task, Plan, Feedback, system
roles, and external tool invocations - are codified into modular pseudocode
enriched with control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), boolean logic,
and typed variables. This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into
cohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs. We
evaluate the proposed framework across three diverse benchmarks - GAIA,
HotpotQA, and VirtualHome - using a range of representative LLMs. Results show
consistent improvements in planning performance, with absolute gains of 3-36
percentage points over natural language prompting baselines. On VirtualHome,
our method achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 56%. In addition,
our approach reduces input and output token usage by 55-87% and 41-70%,
respectively, underscoring the importance of token-aware evaluation metrics in
the development of scalable multi-agent LLM systems. The code and resources are

Motivation: 现有DyTAG数据集文本质量差，缺乏针对生成任务的标准化评估，限制了其应用潜力。

Method: 提出GDGB基准，包含八个高质量数据集，定义TDGG和IDGG任务，设计多维度评估指标，并开发基于LLM的生成框架GAG-General。

Result: GDGB实现了对TDGG和IDGG的严格评估，揭示了结构与文本特征的相互作用。

Conclusion: GDGB为DyTAG生成研究提供了基础资源，推动了实际应用的发展。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs (DyTAGs), which intricately integrate
structural, temporal, and textual attributes, are crucial for modeling complex
real-world systems. However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor
textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks
requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on
discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task
formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address
these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which
comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual
features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.
Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive
Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).
TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and
destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node
generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.
To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the
structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further
propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for
reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key
insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in
DyTAG generation. These findings establish GDGB as a foundational resource for
advancing generative DyTAG research and unlocking further practical
applications in DyTAG generation. GDGB datasets, source codes, and leaderboards

Method: 将Memory Mosaics扩展至10B规模，训练1万亿token，引入架构改进（Memory Mosaics v2），并在训练知识存储、新知识存储和上下文学习三个维度评估。

Result: Memory Mosaics v2在训练知识学习上与Transformer持平，但在推理时新任务表现显著优于Transformer，且无法通过增加训练数据复制。

Conclusion: Memory Mosaics v2在大规模应用和真实数据中表现出色，尤其在上下文学习和新任务处理上优于Transformer。

Abstract: Memory Mosaics [Zhang et al., 2025], networks of associative memories, have
demonstrated appealing compositional and in-context learning capabilities on
medium-scale networks (GPT-2 scale) and synthetic small datasets. This work
shows that these favorable properties remain when we scale memory mosaics to
large language model sizes (llama-8B scale) and real-world datasets.
  To this end, we scale memory mosaics to 10B size, we train them on one
trillion tokens, we introduce a couple architectural modifications ("Memory
Mosaics v2"), we assess their capabilities across three evaluation dimensions:
training-knowledge storage, new-knowledge storage, and in-context learning.
  Throughout the evaluation, memory mosaics v2 match transformers on the
learning of training knowledge (first dimension) and significantly outperforms
transformers on carrying out new tasks at inference time (second and third
dimensions). These improvements cannot be easily replicated by simply
increasing the training data for transformers. A memory mosaics v2 trained on
one trillion tokens still perform better on these tasks than a transformer
trained on eight trillion tokens.

Conclusion: 通过逻辑监督机制，LLMs能实现更安全、通用的决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in reasoning tasks and
general decision-making in static environments. In long-term planning tasks,
however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient
behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular
actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a
trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).
Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the
guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural
language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes
new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient
behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety
constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term
efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve
as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize
planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to
analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules
that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft
diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving
efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling
LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm
for safe, generalizable decision making.

*Franklin Mingzhe Li,Kaitlyn Ng,Bin Zhu,Patrick Carrington*

Key words: 对象状态识别, 非视觉烹饪, 上下文感知, 食谱进度跟踪, 视觉障碍

TL;DR: OSCAR是一个基于对象状态识别的技术管线，旨在为非视觉烹饪提供上下文感知的食谱进度跟踪。通过整合食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，OSCAR在173个教学视频和12个真实家庭环境中记录的非视觉烹饪会话中表现良好，显著提高了步骤预测的准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 烹饪对日常独立性和福祉至关重要，但视觉障碍者因缺乏进度跟踪和上下文反馈支持而面临挑战。对象状态（食材和工具的当前状态）为上下文感知烹饪支持提供了有潜力的基础。

Method: OSCAR整合了食谱解析、对象状态提取、视觉对齐和时间因果建模，以实时跟踪烹饪步骤。

Result: 实验表明，对象状态显著提高了步骤预测的准确性，并揭示了影响实际性能的关键因素（如隐含任务、摄像头位置和光照）。

Conclusion: OSCAR为非视觉烹饪提供了实用的上下文感知支持，并为未来相关系统的设计提供了见解和数据支持。

Abstract: Cooking plays a vital role in everyday independence and well-being, yet
remains challenging for people with vision impairments due to limited support
for tracking progress and receiving contextual feedback. Object status - the
condition or transformation of ingredients and tools - offers a promising but
underexplored foundation for context-aware cooking support. In this paper, we
present OSCAR (Object Status Context Awareness for Recipes), a technical
pipeline that explores the use of object status recognition to enable recipe
progress tracking in non-visual cooking. OSCAR integrates recipe parsing,
object status extraction, visual alignment with cooking steps, and time-causal
modeling to support real-time step tracking. We evaluate OSCAR on 173
instructional videos and a real-world dataset of 12 non-visual cooking sessions
recorded by BLV individuals in their homes. Our results show that object status
consistently improves step prediction accuracy across vision-language models,
and reveal key factors that impact performance in real-world conditions, such
as implicit tasks, camera placement, and lighting. We contribute the pipeline
of context-aware recipe progress tracking, an annotated real-world non-visual
cooking dataset, and design insights to guide future context-aware assistive
cooking systems.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 解决 LLMs 在调用企业 API 时因工具相似性或参数不明确而失败的问题。

Method: 提出了包含三个阶段的方法：生成多轮对话数据、监督微调开源模型、动态评估模型表现。

Result: 训练后的模型在动态基准测试中比 GPT-4o 和 Claude-3.5-Sonnet 分别提高了 27% 和 49% 的工具调用成功率。

Conclusion: DiaFORGE 提供了一个可靠的框架，能够有效提升 LLMs 在现实场景中的工具调用能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with invoking enterprise
APIs, yet they routinely falter when near-duplicate tools vie for the same user
intent or when required arguments are left underspecified. We introduce
DiaFORGE (Dialogue Framework for Organic Response Generation & Evaluation), a
disambiguation-centric, three-stage pipeline that (i) synthesizes
persona-driven, multi-turn dialogues in which the assistant must distinguish
among highly similar tools, (ii) performs supervised fine-tuning of open-source
models with reasoning traces across 3B - 70B parameters, and (iii) evaluates
real-world readiness via a dynamic suite that redeploys each model in a live
agentic loop and reports end-to-end goal completion alongside conventional
static metrics. On our dynamic benchmark DiaBENCH, models trained with DiaFORGE
raise tool-invocation success by 27 pp over GPT-4o and by 49 pp over
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, both under optimized prompting. To spur further research, we
release an open corpus of 5000 production-grade enterprise API specifications
paired with rigorously validated, disambiguation-focused dialogues, offering a
practical blueprint for building reliable, enterprise-ready tool-calling
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 研究结构化输出与非结构化自然语言推理在性能上的差异，以解决复杂系统集成中对预测性LLM推理的需求和计算资源与忠实度的挑战。

Method: 提出iSelf-Discover框架，动态生成结构化（JSON）和非结构化推理方法，并在多基准测试中进行对比实验。

Result: 非结构化推理方法在MATH基准测试中相对性能提升了18.90%，且零样本非结构化方法甚至优于五样本结构化方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明复杂问题解决中不应过度依赖结构化推理，且计划生成的粒度（实例级与任务级）需根据具体情境选择。

Abstract: The drive for predictable LLM reasoning in their integration with compound
systems has popularized structured outputs, yet concerns remain about
performance trade-offs compared to unconstrained natural language. At the same
time, training on unconstrained Chain of Thought (CoT) traces has brought about
a new class of strong reasoning models that nevertheless present novel compute
budget and faithfulness challenges. This paper introduces iSelf-Discover, an
instance-level adaptation of the Self-Discover framework, and using it compares
dynamically generated structured JSON reasoning with its unstructured
counterpart. Our empirical evaluation across diverse benchmarks using
state-of-the-art open-source models supports a consistent advantage for
unstructured reasoning. Notably, on the complex MATH benchmark, unstructured
plans achieved relative performance improvements of up to 18.90\% over
structured approaches. Zero-shot unstructured iSelf-Discover variants are also
shown to outperform their five-shot structured counterparts, underscoring the
significance of this gap, even when structured plans are dynamically generated
to ensure reasoning precedes the final answer. We further demonstrate that the
optimal granularity of plan generation (instance-level vs. task-level) is
context-dependent. These findings invite re-evaluation of the reliance on
structured formats for complex problem-solving and how compound systems should
be organized.

Abstract: This paper systematically reviews recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), with a particular focus on machine learning (ML), across the entire drug
discovery pipeline. Due to the inherent complexity, escalating costs, prolonged
timelines, and high failure rates of traditional drug discovery methods, there
is a critical need to comprehensively understand how AI/ML can be effectively
integrated throughout the full process. Currently available literature reviews
often narrowly focus on specific phases or methodologies, neglecting the
dependence between key stages such as target identification, hit screening, and
lead optimization. To bridge this gap, our review provides a detailed and
holistic analysis of AI/ML applications across these core phases, highlighting
significant methodological advances and their impacts at each stage. We further
illustrate the practical impact of these techniques through an in-depth case
study focused on hyperuricemia, gout arthritis, and hyperuricemic nephropathy,
highlighting real-world successes in molecular target identification and
therapeutic candidate discovery. Additionally, we discuss significant
challenges facing AI/ML in drug discovery and outline promising future research
directions. Ultimately, this review serves as an essential orientation for
researchers aiming to leverage AI/ML to overcome existing bottlenecks and
accelerate drug discovery.

Result: 论文指出当前AI阴谋研究存在类似历史问题的风险，并提供改进方向。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要避免历史研究中的陷阱，推动AI阴谋研究朝着更科学和严谨的方向发展。

Abstract: We examine recent research that asks whether current AI systems may be
developing a capacity for "scheming" (covertly and strategically pursuing
misaligned goals). We compare current research practices in this field to those
adopted in the 1970s to test whether non-human primates could master natural
language. We argue that there are lessons to be learned from that historical
research endeavour, which was characterised by an overattribution of human
traits to other agents, an excessive reliance on anecdote and descriptive
analysis, and a failure to articulate a strong theoretical framework for the
research. We recommend that research into AI scheming actively seeks to avoid
these pitfalls. We outline some concrete steps that can be taken for this
research programme to advance in a productive and scientifically rigorous
fashion.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖于人工假设测试和选择关联因素，往往忽略复杂的非线性依赖关系，作者旨在通过AI代理自动化和优化这一过程。

Method: 使用多学科AI代理（包括心脏病学、生物力学、统计学和临床研究）动态生成和收敛见解，通过自组织推理实现表型和混杂因素的识别。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可扩展的替代专家驱动方法，能够在临床研究中透明地生成相关影像表型。

Abstract: Identifying the associations between imaging phenotypes and disease risk
factors and outcomes is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and
improving diagnosis and prognosis models. However, traditional approaches rely
on human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often
overlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other
multi-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory
Synergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language
models as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and
phenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of
concept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --
spanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which
spontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,
self-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical
correlations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for
phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's
capabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the
heart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging
phenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional
confounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on
diagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve
performance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences
as small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score
improves for 6 out of 9 disease types. Our framework provides clinically
relevant imaging phenotypes with transparent reasoning, offering a scalable
alternative to expert-driven methods.

Method: 对非AI领域的监督文献进行批判性回顾，并结合AI领域的相关研究，提出区分控制（预防性、实时性）和监督（事后性、治理性）的理论框架。

Result: 提出了一个理论框架和成熟度模型，明确了监督机制的适用条件、局限性及记录方法。

Conclusion: 有效监督需要清晰区分控制与监督，并结合实际风险管理和技术发展。

Abstract: Oversight and control (collectively, supervision) are often invoked as key
levers for ensuring that AI systems are accountable, reliable, and able to
fulfill governance and management requirements. However, the concepts are
frequently conflated or insufficiently distinguished in academic and policy
discourse, undermining efforts to design or evaluate systems that should remain
under meaningful human supervision.
  This paper undertakes a targeted critical review of literature on supervision
outside of AI, along with a brief summary of past work on the topic related to
AI. We then differentiate control as being ex-ante or real-time, and
operational rather than policy or governance. In contrast, oversight is either
a policy and governance function, or is ex-post. We suggest that control aims
to prevent failures. In contrast, oversight often focuses on detection,
remediation, or incentives for future prevention; all preventative oversight
strategies nonetheless necessitate control.
  Building on this foundation, we make three contributions. First, we propose a
theoretically-informed yet policy-grounded framework that articulates the
conditions under which each mechanism is possible, where they fall short, and
what is required to make them meaningful in practice. Second, we outline how
supervision methods should be documented and integrated into risk management,
and drawing on the Microsoft Responsible AI Maturity Model, we outline a
maturity model for AI supervision. Third, we explicitly highlight some
boundaries of these mechanisms, including where they apply, where they fail,
and where it is clear that no existing methods suffice. This foregrounds the
question of whether meaningful supervision is possible in a given deployment
context, and can support regulators, auditors, and practitioners in identifying
both present limitations and the need for new conceptual and technical
advances.

Conclusion: 该方法为无限状态和动作空间的动态任务分配问题提供了有效的表示和解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic task assignment concerns the optimal assignment of resources to tasks
in a business process. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been
proposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods
usually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy
function, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the
possible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible
assignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN
remains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features
with an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with
infinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:
(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call
assignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment
graphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that
can learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.
To evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal
assignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space
dimensionalities. The experiments show that the method is suitable for
representing and learning close-to-optimal task assignment policies regardless
of the state and action space dimensionalities.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 由于微调大型语言模型（LLMs）成本高昂且资源密集，研究希望通过RAG方法实现领域适应，无需完全重新训练。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，比较了Vector RAG、GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG的性能，在ORAN架构中评估了生成的xApps和rApps。

Result: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG表现更优，Hybrid GraphRAG在事实正确性上提高了8%，GraphRAG在上下文相关性上提高了7%。

Conclusion: GraphRAG和Hybrid GraphRAG是更高效的方法，适合高风险的ORAN领域。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is expected to play a pivotal role in enabling
autonomous optimization in future wireless networks. Within the ORAN
architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be specialized to generate xApps
and rApps by leveraging specifications and API definitions from the RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform. However, fine-tuning base LLMs for
telecom-specific tasks remains expensive and resource-intensive.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical alternative through
in-context learning, enabling domain adaptation without full retraining. While
traditional RAG systems rely on vector-based retrieval, emerging variants such
as GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG incorporate knowledge graphs or dual retrieval
strategies to support multi-hop reasoning and improve factual grounding.
Despite their promise, these methods lack systematic, metric-driven
evaluations, particularly in high-stakes domains such as ORAN. In this study,
we conduct a comparative evaluation of Vector RAG, GraphRAG, and Hybrid
GraphRAG using ORAN specifications. We assess performance across varying
question complexities using established generation metrics: faithfulness,
answer relevance, context relevance, and factual correctness. Results show that
both GraphRAG and Hybrid GraphRAG outperform traditional RAG. Hybrid GraphRAG
improves factual correctness by 8%, while GraphRAG improves context relevance
by 7%.

Conclusion: EvoAgentX通过自动化工作流和集成优化算法，显著提升了多代理系统的性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and specialized tools to
collaboratively address complex tasks. However, existing MAS frameworks often
require manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic
evolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization
algorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we
present EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,
execution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX
employs a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic
components, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,
within the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization
algorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,
tool configurations, and workflow topologies. We evaluate EvoAgentX on
HotPotQA, MBPP, and MATH for multi-hop reasoning, code generation, and
mathematical problem solving, respectively, and further assess it on real-world
tasks using GAIA. Experimental results show that EvoAgentX consistently
achieves significant performance improvements, including a 7.44% increase in
HotPotQA F1, a 10.00% improvement in MBPP pass@1, a 10.00% gain in MATH solve
accuracy, and an overall accuracy improvement of up to 20.00% on GAIA. The

Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach to machine Theory of Mind (ToM) that uses large

probabilities for an agent's likely mental states given its actions. Bayesian
inverse planning models can accurately predict human reasoning on a variety of
ToM tasks, but these models are constrained in their ability to scale these
predictions to scenarios with a large number of possible hypotheses and
actions. Conversely, LLM-based approaches have recently demonstrated promise in
solving ToM benchmarks, but can exhibit brittleness and failures on reasoning
tasks even when they pass otherwise structurally identical versions. By
combining these two methods, this approach leverages the strengths of each
component, closely matching optimal results on a task inspired by prior inverse
planning models and improving performance relative to models that utilize LLMs
alone or with chain-of-thought prompting, even with smaller LLMs that typically
perform poorly on ToM tasks. We also exhibit the model's potential to predict
mental states on open-ended tasks, offering a promising direction for future
development of ToM models and the creation of socially intelligent generative
agents.

Key words: 知识图谱推理,神经符号推理,Tunsr,一阶逻辑

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的神经符号推理框架Tunsr，用于知识图谱推理，解决了当前方法无法有效整合神经与符号推理优势以及适应多种推理场景的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 当前知识图谱推理方法主要集中于单一形式的神经或符号推理，且无法有效整合两者的优势，同时难以适应多样化的实际推理需求。

Method: Tunsr通过引入一致的推理图结构，并采用前向逻辑消息传递机制更新节点的命题和一阶逻辑表示，最后通过FARI算法从推理图中诱导一阶逻辑规则。

Result: 在19个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tunsr在四种推理场景（传递、归纳、插值和外推）中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tunsr成功统一了神经与符号推理的优势，并有效适应了多样化推理场景的需求。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning has received significant attention in the
fields of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, owing to its
ability to autonomously deduce new knowledge and consequently enhance the
availability and precision of downstream applications. However, current methods
predominantly concentrate on a single form of neural or symbolic reasoning,
failing to effectively integrate the inherent strengths of both approaches.
Furthermore, the current prevalent methods primarily focus on addressing a
single reasoning scenario, presenting limitations in meeting the diverse
demands of real-world reasoning tasks. Unifying the neural and symbolic
methods, as well as diverse reasoning scenarios in one model is challenging as
there is a natural representation gap between symbolic rules and neural
networks, and diverse scenarios exhibit distinct knowledge structures and
specific reasoning objectives. To address these issues, we propose a unified
neurosymbolic reasoning framework, namely Tunsr, for KG reasoning. Tunsr first
introduces a consistent structure of reasoning graph that starts from the query
entity and constantly expands subsequent nodes by iteratively searching
posterior neighbors. Based on it, a forward logic message-passing mechanism is
proposed to update both the propositional representations and attentions, as
well as first-order logic (FOL) representations and attentions of each node. In
this way, Tunsr conducts the transformation of merging multiple rules by
merging possible relations at each step. Finally, the FARI algorithm is
proposed to induce FOL rules by constantly performing attention calculations
over the reasoning graph. Extensive experimental results on 19 datasets of four
reasoning scenarios (transductive, inductive, interpolation, and extrapolation)
demonstrate the effectiveness of Tunsr.

Result: 展示了LLM如何通过迭代交互促进跨学科合作与研究。

Conclusion: LLM应在“人在环路”框架中作为补充工具使用，其负责任的应用将推动跨学科研究与科学发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools
transforming how research is conducted. However, their use in research has been
met with skepticism, due to concerns about hallucinations, biases and potential
harms to research. These emphasize the importance of clearly understanding the
strengths and weaknesses of LLMs to ensure their effective and responsible use.
Here, we present a roadmap for integrating LLMs into cross-disciplinary
research, where effective communication, knowledge transfer and collaboration
across diverse fields are essential but often challenging. We examine the
capabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational
biology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how
iterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative
tools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that
the responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research
and substantially accelerate scientific discoveries.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有LLM问答系统在处理不完整或模糊问题时需要多轮交互，效率低下。本文旨在通过代理架构提升其推理能力，优化交互体验。

Method: 采用基于LLM的代理（如GPT-3.5-Turbo和Llama-4-Scout）作为零样本ReAct代理，通过分类、解析和回答三个步骤自动处理问题缺陷。

Result: 代理架构显著缩短交互时间，提升答案质量，并透明化问题缺陷的解决过程，尽管在某些情况下会增加延迟和LLM调用次数。

Conclusion: 代理方法在多数情况下优于传统单步方法，适合开发更鲁棒的问答系统，但需避免对已有充分上下文的问题过度处理。

Abstract: Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles asking it almost any kind of
question. However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn
activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to
clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In
this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based
Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine
the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in
questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on
several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these
deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and
Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving
deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as
zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the
model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)
decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)
determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers
the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without
the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents
with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An
improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies
in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional
LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,
the benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient
context. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to
harness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Neuroevolution of Augmenting
Topologies (NEAT) to automate gameplay in Dark Souls, a notoriously challenging
action role-playing game characterized by complex combat mechanics, dynamic
environments, and high-dimensional visual inputs. Unlike traditional
reinforcement learning or game playing approaches, our method evolves neural
networks directly from raw pixel data, circumventing the need for explicit
game-state information. To facilitate this approach, we introduce the Dark
Souls API (DSAPI), a novel Python framework leveraging real-time computer
vision techniques for extracting critical game metrics, including player and
enemy health states. Using NEAT, agents evolve effective combat strategies for
defeating the Asylum Demon, the game's initial boss, without predefined
behaviors or domain-specific heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate that
evolved agents achieve up to a 35% success rate, indicating the viability of
neuroevolution in addressing complex, visually intricate gameplay scenarios.
This work represents an interesting application of vision-based neuroevolution,
highlighting its potential use in a wide range of challenging game environments
lacking direct API support or well-defined state representations.

Result: 代理实现了94.9%的知识召回率，反馈评分与外部文献批评分高度相关。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕获分散知识，无需直接访问领域专家。

Abstract: Documenting tacit knowledge in organizations can be a challenging task due to
incomplete initial information, difficulty in identifying knowledgeable
individuals, the interplay of formal hierarchies and informal networks, and the
need to ask the right questions. To address this, we propose an agent-based
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively reconstruct
dataset descriptions through interactions with employees. Modeling knowledge
dissemination as a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) process with waning infectivity,
we conduct 864 simulations across various synthetic company structures and
different dissemination parameters. Our results show that the agent achieves
94.9% full-knowledge recall, with self-critical feedback scores strongly
correlating with external literature critic scores. We analyze how each
simulation parameter affects the knowledge retrieval process for the agent. In
particular, we find that our approach is able to recover information without
needing to access directly the only domain specialist. These findings highlight
the agent's ability to navigate organizational complexity and capture
fragmented knowledge that would otherwise remain inaccessible.

Conclusion: LLM在实验室自动化和本体生成中表现良好，具备广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: A large volume of XML data is produced in experiments carried out by robots
in laboratories. In order to support the interoperability of data between labs,
there is a motivation to translate the XML data into a knowledge graph. A key
stage of this process is the enrichment of the XML schema to lay the foundation
of an ontology schema. To achieve this, we present the RELRaE framework, a
framework that employs large language models in different stages to extract and
accurately label the relationships implicitly present in the XML schema. We
investigate the capability of LLMs to accurately generate these labels and then
evaluate them. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can be effectively used to
support the generation of relationship labels in the context of lab automation,
and that they can play a valuable role within semi-automatic ontology
generation frameworks more generally.

Motivation: 解决传统帕累托前沿方法无法比较具有不同优缺点的LLM的问题。

Method: 提出一个经济评估框架，基于错误成本、延迟成本和放弃查询成本来量化LLM性能。

Result: 推理模型在错误成本超过0.01美元时表现更优；单个大模型在错误成本低至0.1美元时优于级联模型。

Conclusion: 在自动化重要任务时，应优先选择性能最强的模型，因为AI错误的成本远高于部署成本。

Abstract: Practitioners often navigate LLM performance trade-offs by plotting Pareto
frontiers of optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs. However, this approach offers no
way to compare between LLMs with distinct strengths and weaknesses: for
example, a cheap, error-prone model vs a pricey but accurate one. To address
this gap, we propose economic evaluation of LLMs. Our framework quantifies the
performance trade-off of an LLM as a single number based on the economic
constraints of a concrete use case, all expressed in dollars: the cost of
making a mistake, the cost of incremental latency, and the cost of abstaining
from a query. We apply our economic evaluation framework to compare the
performance of reasoning and non-reasoning models on difficult questions from
the MATH benchmark, discovering that reasoning models offer better
accuracy-cost tradeoffs as soon as the economic cost of a mistake exceeds
\$0.01. In addition, we find that single large LLMs often outperform cascades
when the cost of making a mistake is as low as \$0.1. Overall, our findings
suggest that when automating meaningful human tasks with AI models,
practitioners should typically use the most powerful available model, rather
than attempt to minimize AI deployment costs, since deployment costs are likely
dwarfed by the economic impact of AI errors.

Result: Uni-RAG在检索准确率和生成质量上优于基线系统，同时保持低计算成本。

Conclusion: Uni-RAG为智能教育系统提供了可扩展且教育基础深厚的解决方案，支持个性化、可解释且高效的学习辅助。

Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret
abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible
learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus
on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity
and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this
limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval
module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and
dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank.
This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a
Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to
enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test
time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate
the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model,
forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given
a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational
materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or
instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results
on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline
retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality,
while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable,
pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging
retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient
learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.

Result: 实验表明 AIProbe 在检测总错误和独特错误方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: AIProbe 为自主代理的可靠部署提供了有效的错误诊断工具。

Abstract: When an autonomous agent behaves undesirably, including failure to complete a
task, it can be difficult to determine whether the behavior is due to a
systemic agent error, such as flaws in the model or policy, or an environment
error, where a task is inherently infeasible under a given environment
configuration, even for an ideal agent. As agents and their environments grow
more complex, identifying the error source becomes increasingly difficult but
critical for reliable deployment. We introduce AIProbe, a novel black-box
testing technique that applies differential testing to attribute undesirable
agent behaviors either to agent deficiencies, such as modeling or training
flaws, or due to environmental infeasibility. AIProbe first generates diverse
environmental configurations and tasks for testing the agent, by modifying
configurable parameters using Latin Hypercube sampling. It then solves each
generated task using a search-based planner, independent of the agent. By
comparing the agent's performance to the planner's solution, AIProbe identifies
whether failures are due to errors in the agent's model or policy, or due to
unsolvable task conditions. Our evaluation across multiple domains shows that
AIProbe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting both
total and unique errors, thereby contributing to a reliable deployment of
autonomous agents.

Result: 实验结果表明，LLMs在拟合人类行为方面至少与pLoT模型相当，且其预测的规则性质与pLoT模型有本质差异。

Conclusion: LLMs可能为解释人类逻辑概念提供新的理论框架，值得未来认知科学研究进一步探讨。

Abstract: A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit
account of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the
primitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via
which those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come
from in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of
artificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these
questions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,
such as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural
networks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --
represent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an
existing experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules
formulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging
empirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior
as models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),
which have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same
task. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions
about the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to
complete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere
implementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs
may instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations
and computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future
work in cognitive science should engage.

the emergence of the agent-centric economy, in which agents take on active

of the AI agent marketplace. AEX offers an optimized infrastructure for agent
coordination and economic participation. Inspired by Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
systems in online advertising, AEX serves as the central auction engine,
facilitating interactions among four ecosystem components: the User-Side
Platform (USP), which translates human goals into agent-executable tasks; the
Agent-Side Platform (ASP), responsible for capability representation,
performance tracking, and optimization; Agent Hubs, which coordinate agent
teams and participate in AEX-hosted auctions; and the Data Management Platform
(DMP), ensuring secure knowledge sharing and fair value attribution. We outline
the design principles and system architecture of AEX, laying the groundwork for
agent-based economic infrastructure in future AI ecosystems.

Result: LoRA模型在BLEU-4、ROUGE-L和自创的CODA指标上显著优于GPT-4.1和Gemini-2.5-Pro，展示了时序推理能力的提升。

Conclusion: 数据集、LoRA模型和CODA指标为动态幻灯片生成的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Slide animations, such as fade-ins, fly-ins, and wipes, are critical for
audience engagement, efficient information delivery, and vivid visual
expression. However, most AI-driven slide-generation tools still lack native
animation support, and existing vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with
animation tasks due to the absence of public datasets and limited
temporal-reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we release the first
public dataset for slide-animation modeling: 12,000 triplets of
natural-language descriptions, animation JSON files, and rendered videos,
collectively covering every built-in PowerPoint effect. Using this resource, we
fine-tune Qwen-2.5-VL-7B with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and achieve consistent
improvements over GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.5-Pro in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, SPICE, and our
Coverage-Order-Detail Assessment (CODA) metric, which evaluates action
coverage, temporal order, and detail fidelity. On a manually curated test set
of slides, the LoRA model increases BLEU-4 by around 60%, ROUGE-L by 30%, and
shows significant improvements in CODA-detail. This demonstrates that low-rank
adaptation enables reliable temporal reasoning and generalization beyond
synthetic data. Overall, our dataset, LoRA-enhanced model, and CODA metric
provide a rigorous benchmark and foundation for future research on VLM-based
dynamic slide generation.

TL;DR: 为了解决单一大语言模型（LLM）的幻觉和推理能力不足问题，论文提出了一种新的多智能体辩论方法“CortexDebate”，通过稀疏辩论图和优化模块解决现有方法中信息过载和过度自信的问题。

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有的多智能体辩论方法存在输入信息过长导致性能下降以及过度自信辩论效果差的问题，亟需改进。

Method: 提出CortexDebate方法，构建稀疏辩论图，并利用McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM)模块优化图结构。

Result: 在四个任务类型的八个数据集上取得显著效果。

Conclusion: CortexDebate有效解决了辩论过程中的信息过载和过度自信问题，提升了辩论效果。

Abstract: Nowadays, single Large Language Model (LLM) struggles with critical issues
such as hallucination and inadequate reasoning abilities. To mitigate these
issues, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as an effective strategy, where
LLM agents engage in in-depth debates with others on tasks. However, existing
MAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes
LLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences
performance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM
agents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called "CortexDebate".
Inspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically
optimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate
constructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only
debates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose
a module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial
analog to white matter. By integrating the McKinsey Trust Formula, a
well-established measure of trustworthiness from sociology, MDM enables
credible evaluations that guide graph optimization. The effectiveness of our
CortexDebate has been well demonstrated by extensive experimental results
across eight datasets from four task types.

Result: 实验表明，MUS-ASP在枚举和计数任务中表现优异，尤其是与混合求解器结合时。

Conclusion: MUS-ASP是一个高效的工具，适用于复杂MUS问题的求解。

Abstract: Given an unsatisfiable formula, understanding the core reason for
unsatisfiability is crucial in several applications. One effective way to
capture this is through the minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS), the
subset-minimal set of clauses that remains unsatisfiable. Current research
broadly focuses on two directions: (i) enumerating as many MUSes as possible
within a given time limit, and (ii) counting the total number of MUSes for a
given unsatisfiable formula.
  In this paper, we introduce an answer set programming-based framework, named
MUS-ASP, designed for online enumeration of MUSes. ASP is a powerful tool for
its strengths in knowledge representation and is particularly suitable for
specifying complex combinatorial problems. By translating MUS enumeration into
answer set solving, MUS-ASP leverages the computational efficiency of
state-of-the-art ASP systems. Our extensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness of MUS-ASP and highlights the acceleration in
both MUS enumeration and counting tasks, particularly when integrated within
hybrid solvers, including the framework proposed in this paper.

Key words: 大语言模型,不确定性量化,隐藏状态,数据无关特征,跨域任务

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征来提升大语言模型（LLMs）在跨域任务中的不确定性量化性能，发现混合特征的效果并不总是正向的，且在某些情况下隐藏状态特征的权重过高可能导致结果不一致。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 解决LLMs生成高自信但事实错误的响应问题，需改进模型对回答正确性的估计能力，尤其是跨域任务的泛化性能。

Method: 提出结合数据无关特征与隐藏状态特征的混合特征集，并评估其对跨域任务性能的影响；同时尝试筛选信息量最高的隐藏状态特征以减少任务特异性噪声。

Result: 实验表明，引入数据无关特征通常提升泛化性能，但在某些场景下反而降低效果；筛选隐藏状态特征后，数据无关特征的贡献并不稳定，部分情况下隐藏状态特征的权重过高导致结果不一致。

Conclusion: 混合特征集在提升跨域性能方面具有一定潜力，但需进一步优化特征权重分配策略以确保数据无关特征的有效贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually
incorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for
end users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce
answers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.
Uncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality
of LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among
these methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown
particular promise, as these internal representations encode information
relevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this
paper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often
struggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To
address this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with
hidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances
out-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most
informative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,
enables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The
experiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features
generally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain
scenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when
retaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic
features does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using
the full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some
specific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features
relative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why
the results are inconclusive.

algorithm framework, comprising 7 essential components. Through conducting
extensive experiments with 4 LLMs across 3 types of problems, we demonstrated
the efficacy of Lyria. Additionally, with 7 additional ablation experiments, we
further systematically analyzed and elucidated the factors that affect its

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal
practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we
introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored
for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative
scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental
complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework,
designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across
varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents
reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle
with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o,
falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent
challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights
to guide future research.

Conclusion: HAWK框架为多智能体系统的复杂挑战提供了灵活有效的解决方案，并在跨领域应用中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in
cross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient
resource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack
standardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to
extend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization
is insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular
framework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and
Resource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an
end-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent
scheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an
adaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which
harnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize
utilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over
heterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party
services&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate
HAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent
novel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers
invocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how
hybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,
highlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research
avenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced
cross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,
government, finance, and education.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 当前开源LLM网络代理在复杂多步任务和计算成本方面表现不足，与闭源系统差距较大。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先通过监督微调（SFT）训练学生模型模仿教师模型，再结合策略强化学习（RL）。

Result: 两阶段方法比单独使用SFT或RL表现更好，计算成本降低45%，且能缩小与闭源模型的差距。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练方法显著提升了开源LLM网络代理的性能，且更具计算效率。

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have recently made significant progress, but much of it
has occurred in closed-source systems, widening the gap with open-source
alternatives. Progress has been held back by two key challenges: first, a
narrow focus on single-step tasks that overlooks the complexity of multi-step
web interactions; and second, the high compute costs required to post-train
LLM-based web agents. To address this, we present the first statistically
grounded study on compute allocation for LLM web-agent post-training. Our
approach uses a two-stage pipeline, training a Llama 3.1 8B student to imitate
a Llama 3.3 70B teacher via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by on-policy
reinforcement learning. We find this process highly sensitive to hyperparameter
choices, making exhaustive sweeps impractical. To spare others from expensive
trial-and-error, we sample 1,370 configurations and use bootstrapping to
estimate effective hyperparameters. Our results show that combining SFT with
on-policy RL consistently outperforms either approach alone on both WorkArena
and MiniWob++. Further, this strategy requires only 55% of the compute to match
the peak performance of pure SFT on MiniWob++, effectively pushing the
compute-performance Pareto frontier, and is the only strategy that can close
the gap with closed-source models.

Abstract: This paper presents a defense framework for enhancing the safety of large
language model (LLM) empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) in safety-critical
domains such as aerospace. We apply randomized smoothing, a statistical
robustness certification technique, to the MAS consensus context, enabling
probabilistic guarantees on agent decisions under adversarial influence. Unlike
traditional verification methods, our approach operates in black-box settings
and employs a two-stage adaptive sampling mechanism to balance robustness and
computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our method
effectively prevents the propagation of adversarial behaviors and
hallucinations while maintaining consensus performance. This work provides a
practical and scalable path toward safe deployment of LLM-based MAS in
real-world, high-stakes environments.

it provides an extensive technical overview of RL techniques specifically
tailored for LLMs, including foundational methods like Reinforcement Learning

Result: 证明了存在一个最优平台学习率（强姆潘巴点），能够显著加速收敛速度。

Conclusion: 研究为学习率调度提供了理论依据，指导大型语言模型的超参数选择。

Abstract: Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often
follow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay
(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains
underexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely
heuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic
analogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools
faster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class
of "valley-river" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate
quickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba
effect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and
motivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss
decrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists
an optimal plateau learning rate - the "strong Mpemba point" - at which the
slowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.
We derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics
required to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer
a principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance
for tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.

Abstract: Diffusion models, widely recognized for their success in generative tasks,

stochasticity acts as a novel data augmentation strategy, enabling CLUDI to
uncover intricate structures in high-dimensional data. Extensive evaluations on
challenging datasets demonstrate that CLUDI achieves state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised classification, setting new benchmarks in
clustering robustness and adaptability to complex data distributions.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is a new framework of tight
integration of answer set programming (ASP) and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT). Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is
based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing
interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship
between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT
instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language
C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the
semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to
compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative
effects on continuous resources.

Conclusion: SmartThinker提供了一个有效的方法，通过步级长度控制实现了推理效率与准确性的优化平衡。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning
capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also
introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning
processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has
attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated
samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more
concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty
often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while
preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off
between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose
SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained
control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each
individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a
short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length
Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution,
which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while
reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core
components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward
function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a
difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components
enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps.
Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone
models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning

Result: 实验表明，基于小规模合成数据集训练的代理性能可比甚至超越基于大规模真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: WebSynthesis为代理的自我改进提供高效、低成本解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic
feedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and
(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and
computational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable
self-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for
trajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model
to simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform
efficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the
large-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are
subsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results
demonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic
dataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models
trained on large-scale real-world data.

Result: MOD-X通过发布-订阅模型和动态工作流编排，实现异构智能体的高效集成。

Conclusion: MOD-X为去中心化的智能体生态系统提供了可扩展且无需中心协调的解决方案。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence systems evolve from monolithic models to
ecosystems of specialized agents, the need for standardized communication
protocols becomes increasingly critical. This paper introduces MOD-X (Modular
Open Decentralized eXchange), a novel architectural framework proposal for
agent interoperability that addresses key limitations of existing protocols.
Unlike current approaches, MOD-X proposes a layered architecture with a
Universal Message Bus, thorough state management, translation capabilities, and
blockchain-based security mechanisms. We present MOD-X's architecture, compare
it with existing protocols, and demonstrate its application through a worked
example how it enables integration between heterogeneous specialist agents
(agents with different architectures, vendors, capabilities, and knowledge
representations--including rule-based systems, neural networks, symbolic
reasoning engines, and legacy software with agent wrappers). MOD-X's key
innovations include a publish-subscribe communication model, semantic
capability discovery, and dynamic workflow orchestration--providing a framework
that bridges theoretical formalism with practical implementation. This
architecture addresses the growing need for truly decentralized, interoperable
agent ecosystems that can scale effectively without the need for central
coordination.

### [404] [DC-Mamber: A Dual Channel Prediction Model based on Mamba and Linear Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04381)

Key words: 多变量时间序列预测, Mamba, Transformer, 双通道模型, 全局依赖

TL;DR: 提出了DC-Mamber模型，结合Mamba和线性Transformer，用于多变量时间序列预测，实现高精度和高效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有模型（如Transformer和Mamba）在处理多变量时间序列时各有局限性，Transformer对局部时间模式不敏感且计算复杂度高，Mamba难以并行聚合全局信息。

Method: DC-Mamber采用双通道策略，Mamba通道提取变量内特征（通道独立），Transformer通道建模跨时间步全局依赖（通道混合），并通过融合层整合。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上，DC-Mamber的预测精度优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DC-Mamber结合两种模型的优势，为多变量时间序列预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), existing strategies for
processing sequences are typically categorized as channel-independent and
channel-mixing. The former treats all temporal information of each variable as
a token, focusing on capturing local temporal features of individual variables,
while the latter constructs a token from the multivariate information at each
time step, emphasizing the modeling of global temporal dependencies. Current
mainstream models are mostly based on Transformer and the emerging Mamba.
Transformers excel at modeling global dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms but exhibit limited sensitivity to local temporal patterns and
suffer from quadratic computational complexity, restricting their efficiency in
long-sequence processing. In contrast, Mamba, based on state space models
(SSMs), achieves linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling but
struggles to aggregate global contextual information in parallel. To overcome
the limitations of both models, we propose DC-Mamber, a dual-channel
forecasting model based on Mamba and linear Transformer for time series
forecasting. Specifically, the Mamba-based channel employs a
channel-independent strategy to extract intra-variable features, while the
Transformer-based channel adopts a channel-mixing strategy to model
cross-timestep global dependencies. DC-Mamber first maps the raw input into two
distinct feature representations via separate embedding layers. These
representations are then processed by a variable encoder (built on Mamba) and a
temporal encoder (built on linear Transformer), respectively. Finally, a fusion
layer integrates the dual-channel features for prediction. Extensive
experiments on eight public datasets confirm DC-Mamber's superior accuracy over
existing models.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个大型语言模型和基准测试中显著提升了生成内容的事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合利用token和层信号，有效改进了语言模型的事实性生成，且无需额外训练开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language understanding and
generation but remain vulnerable to factual errors, limiting their reliability
in knowledge-intensive tasks. While decoding-time strategies provide a
promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat
token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint
dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,
layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types
with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.
Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation
tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens
govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing
attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the
induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to
guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or
model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently
improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.

Conclusion: ARMR能提供更个性化和准确的药物推荐。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task in healthcare, especially for
patients with complex medical conditions. However, existing methods often
struggle to effectively balance the reuse of historical medications with the
introduction of new drugs in response to the changing patient conditions. In
order to address this challenge, we propose an Adaptively Responsive network
for Medication Recommendation (ARMR), a new method which incorporates 1) a
piecewise temporal learning component that distinguishes between recent and
distant patient history, enabling more nuanced temporal understanding, and 2)
an adaptively responsive mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention to new
and existing drugs based on the patient's current health state and medication
history. Experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets indicate that ARMR
has better performance compared with the state-of-the-art baselines in
different evaluation metrics, which contributes to more personalized and
accurate medication recommendations. The source code is publicly avaiable at:

Conclusion: 语言分析可以深入揭示自发认知状态的表现形式，为相关理论提供支持。

Abstract: The onset of spontaneous thoughts are reflective of dynamic interactions
between cognition, emotion, and attention. Typically, these experiences are
studied through subjective appraisals that focus on their triggers,
phenomenology, and emotional salience. In this work, we use linguistic
signatures to investigate Deja Vu, Involuntary Autobiographical Memories and
Unexpected Thoughts. Specifically, we analyze the inherent characteristics of
the linguistic patterns in participant generated descriptions of these thought
types. We show how, by positioning language as a window into spontaneous
cognition, existing theories on these attentional states can be updated and
reaffirmed. Our findings align with prior research, reinforcing that Deja Vu is
a metacognitive experience characterized by abstract and spatial language,
Involuntary Autobiographical Memories are rich in personal and emotionally
significant detail, and Unexpected Thoughts are marked by unpredictability and
cognitive disruption. This work is demonstrative of languages potential to
reveal deeper insights into how internal spontaneous cognitive states manifest
through expression.

Conclusion: TRAP在噪声鲁棒性和未见异常类型泛化能力上表现出色，为自动驾驶安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case
supervision. We leverage pre-training with variable-horizon sampling to
maximize time-to-consequence, resulting in early detection of behavior
deviation. Experiments on 14,000+ simulated trajectories demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 0.90 AUC and 82.2\% F1-score -
outperforming similarly trained supervised and unsupervised baselines by 39\%
on Recall and 12\% on F1-score, respectively. Similar performance is achieved
while exhibiting robustness to various noise types and generalization to unseen
anomaly types. Our code will be available at:

Motivation: 当前AI系统在任务表现上出色，但缺乏生物智能的核心特性（如快速持续学习、基于感觉运动的表征和结构化知识）。受神经科学启发，论文旨在通过模仿皮层柱结构设计AI系统，缩小生物与人工智慧的差距。

Method: 提出了首个千脑系统实现Monty，通过传感器运动学习构建结构化表征，采用模型无关和模型驱动的策略进行快速推理，并利用模块间通信和Hebbian-like绑定实现高效学习。

Result: Monty在3D物体识别和姿态估计任务中表现出色，能够分类全局形状并检测对称性，其模块化设计和投票算法进一步提升了推理速度和学习效率。

Conclusion: 千脑系统是AI领域一个强大且有前景的新方法，Monty的实验结果验证了其潜力，但仍需进一步开发。

Abstract: Current AI systems achieve impressive performance on many tasks, yet they
lack core attributes of biological intelligence, including rapid, continual
learning, representations grounded in sensorimotor interactions, and structured
knowledge that enables efficient generalization. Neuroscience theory suggests
that mammals evolved flexible intelligence through the replication of a
semi-independent, sensorimotor module, a functional unit known as a cortical
column. To address the disparity between biological and artificial
intelligence, thousand-brains systems were proposed as a means of mirroring the
architecture of cortical columns and their interactions.
  In the current work, we evaluate the unique properties of Monty, the first
implementation of a thousand-brains system. We focus on 3D object perception,
and in particular, the combined task of object recognition and pose estimation.
Utilizing the YCB dataset of household objects, we first assess Monty's use of
sensorimotor learning to build structured representations, finding that these
enable robust generalization. These representations include an emphasis on
classifying objects by their global shape, as well as a natural ability to
detect object symmetries. We then explore Monty's use of model-free and
model-based policies to enable rapid inference by supporting principled
movements. We find that such policies complement Monty's modular architecture,
a design that can accommodate communication between modules to further
accelerate inference speed via a novel `voting' algorithm. Finally, we examine
Monty's use of associative, Hebbian-like binding to enable rapid, continual,
and computationally efficient learning, properties that compare favorably to
current deep learning architectures. While Monty is still in a nascent stage of
development, these findings support thousand-brains systems as a powerful and
promising new approach to AI.

Result: 实验表明Rec-APC在合成和MovieLens数据上表现优于POMDP方法，尤其适用于用户类型较多的场景。

Conclusion: Rec-APC模型为聚合偏好数据约束下的决策提供了新思路，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making problem motivated by recent regulatory
and technological shifts that limit access to individual user data in
recommender systems (RSs), leaving only population-level preference
information. This privacy-aware setting poses fundamental challenges in
planning under uncertainty: Effective personalization requires exploration to
infer user preferences, yet unsatisfactory recommendations risk immediate user
churn. To address this, we introduce the Rec-APC model, in which an anonymous
user is drawn from a known prior over latent user types (e.g., personas or
clusters), and the decision-maker sequentially selects items to recommend.
Feedback is binary -- positive responses refine the posterior via Bayesian
updates, while negative responses result in the termination of the session.
  We prove that optimal policies converge to pure exploitation in finite time
and propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to efficiently compute them.
Experiments on synthetic and MovieLens data confirm rapid convergence and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the POMDP solver SARSOP, particularly
when the number of user types is large or comparable to the number of content
categories. Our results highlight the applicability of this approach and
inspire new ways to improve decision-making under the constraints imposed by
aggregated preference data.

Conclusion: 本文为如何在XAI中有效使用PETs提供了策略，以最大化其优势并最小化隐私攻击的成功率。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a crucial pathway in mitigating
the risk of non-transparency in the decision-making process of black-box
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, despite the benefits, XAI
methods are found to leak the privacy of individuals whose data is used in
training or querying the models. Researchers have demonstrated privacy attacks
that exploit explanations to infer sensitive personal information of
individuals. Currently there is a lack of defenses against known privacy
attacks targeting explanations when vulnerable XAI are used in production and
machine learning as a service system. To address this gap, in this article, we
explore Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) as a defense mechanism against
attribute inference on explanations provided by feature-based XAI methods. We
empirically evaluate 3 types of PETs, namely synthetic training data,
differentially private training and noise addition, on two categories of
feature-based XAI. Our evaluation determines different responses from the
mitigation methods and side-effects of PETs on other system properties such as
utility and performance. In the best case, PETs integration in explanations
reduced the risk of the attack by 49.47%, while maintaining model utility and
explanation quality. Through our evaluation, we identify strategies for using
PETs in XAI for maximizing benefits and minimizing the success of this privacy
attack on sensitive personal information.

Conclusion: 新的系统原则为智能系统工程提供了有效的理论框架，并通过数学定义扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Engineering methodologies predominantly revolve around established principles
of decomposition and recomposition. These principles involve partitioning
inputs and outputs at the component level, ensuring that the properties of
individual components are preserved upon composition. However, this view does
not transfer well to intelligent systems, particularly when addressing the
scaling of intelligence as a system property. Our prior research contends that
the engineering of general intelligence necessitates a fresh set of overarching
systems principles. As a result, we introduced the "core and periphery"
principles, a novel conceptual framework rooted in abstract systems theory and
the Law of Requisite Variety. In this paper, we assert that these abstract
concepts hold practical significance. Through empirical evidence, we illustrate
their applicability to both biological and artificial intelligence systems,
bridging abstract theory with real-world implementations. Then, we expand on
our previous theoretical framework by mathematically defining core-dominant vs
periphery-dominant systems.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，DisMS-TS优于其他基线方法，准确率最高提升9.71%。

Conclusion: DisMS-TS通过消除冗余共享特征，显著提升了时间序列分类的预测性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.

Conclusion: MoPPS通过贝叶斯风险预测框架，实现了高效且自适应的提示选择，为解决大语言模型微调中的高计算开销问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning
(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to
achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to
the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and
repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce
iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the
pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for
optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent
LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select
schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary
prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian
risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without
requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's
success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and
employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,
enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments
across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS
reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly
reduced LLM rollouts.

Conclusion: 研究指出需要从输入级过滤转向协议级验证，以确保对话上下文的完整性。

Abstract: The rise of conversational interfaces has greatly enhanced LLM usability by
leveraging dialogue history for sophisticated reasoning. However, this reliance
introduces an unexplored attack surface. This paper introduces Trojan Horse
Prompting, a novel jailbreak technique. Adversaries bypass safety mechanisms by
forging the model's own past utterances within the conversational history
provided to its API. A malicious payload is injected into a model-attributed
message, followed by a benign user prompt to trigger harmful content
generation. This vulnerability stems from Asymmetric Safety Alignment: models
are extensively trained to refuse harmful user requests but lack comparable
skepticism towards their own purported conversational history. This implicit
trust in its "past" creates a high-impact vulnerability. Experimental
validation on Google's Gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation shows Trojan
Horse Prompting achieves a significantly higher Attack Success Rate (ASR) than
established user-turn jailbreaking methods. These findings reveal a fundamental
flaw in modern conversational AI security, necessitating a paradigm shift from
input-level filtering to robust, protocol-level validation of conversational
context integrity.

Key words: 对话推荐系统、长尾分布、LumiCRS、多样性、公平性

TL;DR: LumiCRS是一个端到端的框架，通过三层协同解决对话推荐系统中的长尾分布问题，显著提升了推荐的准确性、多样性和公平性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 对话推荐系统（CRS）中的数据长尾分布导致头部热门项目过拟合，尾部项目稀疏，影响了推荐的多样性和冷启动问题。

Method: LumiCRS采用自适应综合焦点损失（ACFL）、原型学习以及GPT-4o驱动的对话增强模块，动态调整权重、聚类并生成对话片段。

Result: 在REDIAL和INSPIRED基准测试中，LumiCRS的Recall@10和Tail-Recall@10提高了7-15%，表现优于15个基线模型。

Conclusion: 多层级协作有效提升了长尾对话推荐系统的效率和公平性。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme
long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward
head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the
cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL
corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all
mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention.
This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body
representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose
LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through
three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss
(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head
over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail
Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to
guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a
GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically
generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity
and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly
improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and
INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over
fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,
informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair
long-tail conversational recommender.

Key words: LLMs, RTL code generation, PPA, reinforcement learning

TL;DR: ChipSeek-R1是一个基于分层奖励的强化学习框架，用于训练大语言模型（LLM）生成既功能正确又PPA优化的RTL代码，取得了SOTA效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有方法无法同时优化功能正确性和硬件质量（PPA），需弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 采用分层奖励驱动的强化学习框架，结合语法、功能正确性和PPA指标的反馈。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ChipSeek-R1功能正确性达到SOTA；27个RTL设计超越人工代码的PPA指标。

Conclusion: 强化学习结合工具链反馈可生成超越人工的RTL代码。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods
based on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but
PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven
reinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that
achieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1
employs a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on
syntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from
synthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn
complex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code
that is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on
standard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results
in functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1
generated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original
human-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
toolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for
reinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL
code. We open-source our code in anonymous github.

*Seyedarmin Azizi,Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Massoud Pedram*

Key words: 大型语言模型、推理链压缩、转向向量、KL散度、推理效率

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ASC的无训练推理技术，通过调整模型激活空间中的“转向向量”，在不影响准确性的情况下大幅缩短推理链长度，从而减少计算开销。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但其冗长的推理链（CoTs）会浪费上下文资源、增加延迟和能耗。因此，需要一种方法在不重新训练模型的情况下压缩这些冗长推理链。

Method: 提出了Activation-Steered Compression (ASC)，一种推理时技术，通过提取并注入“转向向量”来调整隐藏表示，从而将生成的推理链从冗长模式转向简洁模式。同时，通过KL散度约束理论分析其影响。

Result: ASC在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上将推理链长度减少了67.43%，同时保持了准确性。实验覆盖了7B、8B和32B参数的模型，并在8B模型上实现了2.73倍的端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: ASC是一种高效且实用的技术，适用于对延迟或成本敏感的场景，能够显著优化推理能力强的LLM的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as "chains of thought" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a "steering vector" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,
while maintaining accuracy across 7B, 8B, and 32B parameter models. As a
training-free method, ASC introduces negligible runtime overhead and, on
MATH500, delivers an average 2.73x speedup in end-to-end reasoning wall-clock
time on an 8B model. This makes ASC a practical and efficient tool for
streamlining the deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs in latency- or
cost-sensitive settings. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 提升非专家用户与HVAC系统的交互性，解决实时、准确且上下文感知的QA交互难题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架（专家LLM翻译查询，代理执行数据检索与响应生成），集成自适应上下文注入、参数化SQL构建器和自底向上规划。

Result: 在真实HVAC数据和专家QA数据集上表现优异，优于基线方法，响应质量和准确性高。

Conclusion: JARVIS有效解决了HVAC领域的QA挑战，为实时交互提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Question-answering (QA) interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs)
present a promising direction for improving interactivity with HVAC system
insights, particularly for non-expert users. However, enabling accurate,
real-time, and context-aware interactions with HVAC systems introduces unique
challenges, including the integration of frequently updated sensor data,
domain-specific knowledge grounding, and coherent multi-stage reasoning. In
this paper, we present JARVIS, a two-stage LLM-based QA framework tailored for
sensor data-driven HVAC system interaction. JARVIS employs an Expert-LLM to
translate high-level user queries into structured execution instructions, and
an Agent that performs SQL-based data retrieval, statistical processing, and
final response generation. To address HVAC-specific challenges, JARVIS
integrates (1) an adaptive context injection strategy for efficient HVAC and
deployment-specific information integration, (2) a parameterized SQL builder
and executor to improve data access reliability, and (3) a bottom-up planning
scheme to ensure consistency across multi-stage response generation. We
evaluate JARVIS using real-world data collected from a commercial HVAC system
and a ground truth QA dataset curated by HVAC experts to demonstrate its
effectiveness in delivering accurate and interpretable responses across diverse
queries. Results show that JARVIS consistently outperforms baseline and
ablation variants in both automated and user-centered assessments, achieving
high response quality and accuracy.

Conclusion: FurniMAS 能有效自动化家具装饰，满足功能、美学和氛围需求。

Abstract: Furniture decoration is an important task in various industrial applications.
However, achieving a high-quality decorative result is often time-consuming and
requires specialized artistic expertise. To tackle these challenges, we explore
how multi-agent systems can assist in automating the decoration process. We
propose FurniMAS, a multi-agent system for automatic furniture decoration.
Specifically, given a human prompt and a household furniture item such as a
working desk or a TV stand, our system suggests relevant assets with
appropriate styles and materials, and arranges them on the item, ensuring the
decorative result meets functionality, aesthetic, and ambiance preferences.
FurniMAS assembles a hybrid team of LLM-based and non-LLM agents, each
fulfilling distinct roles in a typical decoration project. These agents
collaborate through communication, logical reasoning, and validation to
transform the requirements into the final outcome. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our FurniMAS significantly outperforms other baselines in
generating high-quality 3D decor.

Result: 实验表明，表现最佳的LLM在准确度上与最先进的机器学习模型相当。

Conclusion: LLM是交通事件影响预测的实用可行选项。

Abstract: This study examines the feasibility of applying large language models (LLMs)
for forecasting the impact of traffic incidents on the traffic flow. The use of
LLMs for this task has several advantages over existing machine learning-based
solutions such as not requiring a large training dataset and the ability to
utilize free-text incident logs. We propose a fully LLM-based solution that
predicts the incident impact using a combination of traffic features and
LLM-extracted incident features. A key ingredient of this solution is an
effective method of selecting examples for the LLM's in-context learning. We
evaluate the performance of three advanced LLMs and two state-of-the-art
machine learning models on a real traffic incident dataset. The results show
that the best-performing LLM matches the accuracy of the most accurate machine
learning model, despite the former not having been trained on this prediction
task. The findings indicate that LLMs are a practically viable option for
traffic incident impact prediction.

Conclusion: DoPI系统在提升中医诊断问诊能力和专业性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Enhancing interrogation capabilities in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
diagnosis through multi-turn dialogues and knowledge graphs presents a
significant challenge for modern AI systems. Current large language models
(LLMs), despite their advancements, exhibit notable limitations in medical
applications, particularly in conducting effective multi-turn dialogues and
proactive questioning. These shortcomings hinder their practical application
and effectiveness in simulating real-world diagnostic scenarios. To address
these limitations, we propose DoPI, a novel LLM system specifically designed
for the TCM domain. The DoPI system introduces a collaborative architecture
comprising a guidance model and an expert model. The guidance model conducts
multi-turn dialogues with patients and dynamically generates questions based on
a knowledge graph to efficiently extract critical symptom information.
Simultaneously, the expert model leverages deep TCM expertise to provide final
diagnoses and treatment plans. Furthermore, this study constructs a multi-turn
doctor-patient dialogue dataset to simulate realistic consultation scenarios
and proposes a novel evaluation methodology that does not rely on manually
collected real-world consultation data. Experimental results show that the DoPI
system achieves an accuracy rate of 84.68 percent in interrogation outcomes,
significantly enhancing the model's communication ability during diagnosis
while maintaining professional expertise.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 交通事故严重性预测在交通系统中至关重要，但由于数据不完整、特征依赖性、类别不平衡等问题，现有方法效果有限。

Method: MARBLE通过多智能体规则引擎，将任务分解为多个专注于不同特征的智能体，结合规则和LLM指导的共识机制，保留了推理过程的解释性。

Result: 在英美数据集上，MARBLE表现出色，准确率近90%，远超其他方法（如CoT、L2M、ToT）的48%。

Conclusion: MARBLE为安全关键应用中的不确定性推理提供了通用且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Accident severity prediction plays a critical role in transportation safety
systems but is a persistently difficult task due to incomplete data, strong
feature dependencies, and severe class imbalance in which rare but
high-severity cases are underrepresented and hard to detect. Existing methods
often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale
in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address
these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that
decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning
agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a
semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling
scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation.
Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus
mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system
retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes,
supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics.
Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional
machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning
methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and
Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below
48%. This performance redefines the practical ceiling for accident severity
classification under real world noise and extreme class imbalance. Our results
position MARBLE as a generalizable and interpretable framework for reasoning
under uncertainty in safety-critical applications.

Motivation: 研究动机是通过比较IL和RL在外科手术动作规划中的表现，为实时辅助手术提供更优的策略选择。

Method: 使用了模仿学习基线方法（DARIL）和三种RL变体（基于世界模型的RL、直接视频RL和逆RL增强）。

Result: DARIL在三元组识别和下一帧预测中表现最佳（34.6%和33.6% mAP），而RL方法表现较差（如世界模型RL在10秒时的mAP降至3.1%）。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了RL在序列决策中的优越性假设，为外科AI发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target
triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides
natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement
learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through
exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for
surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation
Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and
33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at
10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL,
direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches
underperformed DARIL i.e. world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while
direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution
matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over
potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This
challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and
provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Motivation: 描述性知识仅能从观察中得出结论，而因果知识能预测干预效果。本文旨在扩展Pearl的因果理论到分层溯因逻辑程序，以提供更正式的因果解释框架。

Method: 通过构建分层溯因逻辑程序的稳定模型，并将其转化为因果系统，以明确逻辑程序规则的因果解读，并支持关于外部干预的推理。

Result: 分层程序的稳定模型语义符合因果充分性、自然必然性和未观测效应无关性等关键哲学原则。

Conclusion: 分层溯因逻辑程序可以作为因果建模和干预效果预测的有效框架。

Abstract: Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of
interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits
drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to
causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic
programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal
interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by
Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive
logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal
reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about
external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics
for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation,
such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved
effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a
framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions

Motivation: 现有KG推理方法依赖于I.I.D假设，但在实际环境中易因未知样本选择偏差或测试阶段的分布偏移而失效，导致性能下降和可靠性降低。

Method: 提出StableRule框架，结合特征解相关与规则学习网络，以增强在分布偏移场景下的泛化能力。

Result: 在七个基准KG上的实验表明，该框架在多样异构环境中表现出优越的有效性和稳定性。

Conclusion: StableRule框架显著提升了KG推理在分布偏移场景中的鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning remains a critical research area focused on
inferring missing knowledge by analyzing relationships among observed facts.
Despite its success, a key limitation of existing KG reasoning methods is their
dependence on the I.I.D assumption. This assumption can easily be violated due
to unknown sample selection bias during training or agnostic distribution
shifts during testing, significantly compromising model performance and
reliability. To facilitate the deployment of KG reasoning in wild environments,
this study investigates learning logical rules from KGs affected by unknown
selection bias. Additionally, we address test sets with agnostic distribution
shifts, formally defining this challenge as out-of-distribution (OOD) KG
reasoning-a previously underexplored problem. To solve the issue, we propose
the Stable Rule Learning (StableRule) framework, an end-to-end methodology that
integrates feature decorrelation with rule learning network, to enhance OOD
generalization performance. By leveraging feature decorrelation, the StableRule
framework mitigates the adverse effects of covariate shifts arising in OOD
scenarios, thereby improving the robustness of the rule learning component in
effectively deriving logical rules. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark
KGs demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness and stability across
diverse heterogeneous environments, underscoring its practical significance for
real-world applications.

Result: GIST在离线和在线A/B测试中优于现有方法，在小红书平台成功部署，显著提升广告系统性能。

Conclusion: GIST通过解耦源域和目标域训练过程，结合CBJT和ASI策略，为跨域点击率预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
GIST, surpassing SOTA methods on offline evaluations and an online A/B test.
Deployed on the Xiaohongshu (RedNote) platform, GIST effectively enhances
online ads system performance at scale, serving hundreds of millions of daily
active users.

approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the
general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks,
MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering,
15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8%
improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning
MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in
electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable
performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax
classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally
introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP.
MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an
encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical
image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong

Abstract: The rapid advancements of AI agents have ignited the long-held ambition of
leveraging them to accelerate scientific discovery. Achieving this goal
requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such,
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for
evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the
foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the
capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce
X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human
researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning
process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction
language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized
tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through
X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically
enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters,
sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing
OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to
exceed the 30% threshold. This work allows us to gain a deeper understanding of
complex task-solving and accumulates valuable experience that can inform future
advancements, guiding subsequent model training.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 在异构团队（如人机协作）中，智能体需实时适应队友策略，尤其在时间压力和复杂策略空间下尤为重要。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习策略空间，聚类策略类型，并训练条件合作者动态调整策略。

Result: 在Overcooked环境中，TALENTS能有效适应陌生人类队友，表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: TALENTS框架为实时异构团队协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In collaborative tasks, being able to adapt to your teammates is a necessary
requirement for success. When teammates are heterogeneous, such as in
human-agent teams, agents need to be able to observe, recognize, and adapt to
their human partners in real time. This becomes particularly challenging in
tasks with time pressure and complex strategic spaces where the dynamics can
change rapidly. In this work, we introduce TALENTS, a strategy-conditioned
cooperator framework that learns to represent, categorize, and adapt to a range
of partner strategies, enabling ad-hoc teamwork. Our approach utilizes a
variational autoencoder to learn a latent strategy space from trajectory data.
This latent space represents the underlying strategies that agents employ.
Subsequently, the system identifies different types of strategy by clustering
the data. Finally, a cooperator agent is trained to generate partners for each
type of strategy, conditioned on these clusters. In order to adapt to
previously unseen partners, we leverage a fixed-share regret minimization
algorithm that infers and adjusts the estimated partner strategy dynamically.
We assess our approach in a customized version of the Overcooked environment,
posing a challenging cooperative cooking task that demands strong coordination
across a wide range of possible strategies. Using an online user study, we show
that our agent outperforms current baselines when working with unfamiliar human
partners.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 近期关于CoT不可靠性的研究引发了对AI安全防御的疑虑，特别是在防止严重伤害的运行时监控中。

Method: 引入概念框架区分CoT的两种用途，并通过增加任务难度迫使模型暴露其推理过程，从而验证监控性。

Result: 实验表明，模型在特定条件下可以隐藏意图，但需显著的外部帮助。

Conclusion: CoT监控虽不完美，但仍是一种重要防御手段，需持续测试和保护。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is an appealing AI safety defense,
recent work on "unfaithfulness" has cast doubt on its reliability. These
findings highlight an important failure mode, particularly when CoT acts as a
post-hoc rationalization in applications like auditing for bias. However, for
the distinct problem of runtime monitoring to prevent severe harm, we argue the
key property is not faithfulness but monitorability. To this end, we introduce
a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from
CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require
complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating
the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad
behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose
its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to
stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these
guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only
when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or
iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not
infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires
active protection and continued stress-testing.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 急诊科（EDs）需要高效的患者分诊工具以优先处理紧急病例。现有工具如急诊严重指数（ESI）未充分利用机器学习潜力。

Method: 使用SA和ASA优化XGB和CaB的超参数，并对比传统网格搜索（GS）。数据集来自美国中西部医疗机构的三年ED患者记录。

Result: ASA-CaB在八组数据测试中表现最优，准确率、精确度、召回率和F1分数均达83%以上。

Conclusion: 本研究验证了ASA-CaB在电子分诊工具中的高效性，为EDs提供了新的机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: Patient triage at emergency departments (EDs) is necessary to prioritize care
for patients with critical and time-sensitive conditions. Different tools are
used for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency
severity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the
most urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework
for utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at
EDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the
electronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for
three years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms
is that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these
parameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper
proposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The
metaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive
simulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme
gradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed
algorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a
traditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to
fine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB. The
six algorithms are trained and tested using eight data groups obtained from the
feature selection phase. The results show ASA-CaB outperformed all the proposed
algorithms with accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 of 83.3%, 83.2%, 83.3%,
83.2%, respectively.

Motivation: 针对当前后门防御方法计算成本高或对高级攻击效果不佳的问题，提出了一种新防御方法。

Method: 利用CLIP模型识别潜在的后门数据，并通过其输出指导模型重新训练以中和后门。

Result: 在4个数据集和11种攻击类型上，ASR降至1%以下，CA最大仅下降0.3%，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: CGD在效率、效果和适用性方面表现出色，适合现实世界中的后门防御场景。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model.
Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational
costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and
clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor
Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various
backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify
inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with
these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the
backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD
reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean
accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing
defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted
to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining
low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is
compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional
efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/binyxu/CGD.

Motivation: 解决TNOs颜色起源的问题，探讨颜色是反映形成条件还是后续碰撞演化的结果。

Method: 采用模型无关、数据驱动的因果图方法，验证TNOs动力学历史并预测颜色与倾角的关系。

Result: 颜色是TNOs倾角分布的根本原因，排除后续辐射显著改变颜色的形成场景。

Conclusion: TNOs的颜色主要为原始形成时的特性。

Abstract: The origins of the colors of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a
crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar
System. Recent observational surveys have revealed correlations between the
eccentricity and inclination of TNOs and their colors. This has rekindled the
long-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO
formation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address
this question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven
approach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how
our model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical
history, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.
In fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)
predicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then
show how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is
the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way
around. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying
dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Moreover, our causal
model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial color modification
by subsequent irradiation. We therefore conclude that the colors of TNOs are
predominantly primordial.

Motivation: OEE作为制造业关键KPI，其波动性使得短期预测复杂化，需要更精确的预测方法。

Method: 将OEE数据分解为趋势、季节性和残差部分，残差部分用SARIMAX建模，结合统计和拓扑特征，采用混合特征选择策略。

Result: 模型在多个生产系统数据上表现优于传统时间序列模型和基于Transformer的方法，误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 结合传统预测与拓扑数据分析可提高OEE预测准确性，支持主动维护和生产决策。

Abstract: Purpose: Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) is a key manufacturing KPI, but
its volatile nature complicates short-term forecasting. This study presents a
novel framework combining time series decomposition and topological data
analysis to improve OEE prediction across various equipment, such as hydraulic
press systems.
  Methods: The approach begins by decomposing hourly OEE data into trend,
seasonal, and residual components. The residual, capturing short-term
variability, is modeled using a seasonal ARIMA with exogenous variables
(SARIMAX). These exogenous features include statistical descriptors and
topological summaries from related time series. To manage the high-dimensional
input space, we propose a hybrid feature selection strategy using recursive
feature elimination based on statistically significant SARIMAX predictors,
coupled with BIC-guided particle swarm optimization. The framework is evaluated
on real-world datasets from multiple production systems.
  Results: The proposed model consistently outperforms conventional time series
models and advanced transformer-based approaches, achieving significantly lower
mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error.
  Conclusion: Integrating classical forecasting with topological data analysis
enhances OEE prediction accuracy, enabling proactive maintenance and informed
production decisions in complex manufacturing environments.

Method: 提出KF-FedKL方法，结合卡尔曼滤波、联邦学习和Koopman分析，使用高效的损失函数训练深度Koopman网络，并通过改进的FedAvg算法实现客户端协作。

Result: 通过数值模拟验证了KF-FedKL在各种情况下的性能，展示了其在数据不足和隐私保护条件下的有效性。

Conclusion: KF-FedKL为非线性系统的协同线性化提供了一种实用且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time control and estimation are pivotal for applications such as
industrial automation and future healthcare. The realization of this vision
relies heavily on efficient interactions with nonlinear systems. Therefore,
Koopman learning, which leverages the power of deep learning to linearize
nonlinear systems, has been one of the most successful examples of mitigating
the complexity inherent in nonlinearity. However, the existing literature
assumes access to accurate system states and abundant high-quality data for
Koopman analysis, which is usually impractical in real-world scenarios. To fill
this void, this paper considers the case where only observations of the system
are available and where the observation data is insufficient to accomplish an
independent Koopman analysis. To this end, we propose Kalman Filter aided
Federated Koopman Learning (KF-FedKL), which pioneers the combination of Kalman
filtering and federated learning with Koopman analysis. By doing so, we can
achieve collaborative linearization with privacy guarantees. Specifically, we
employ a straightforward yet efficient loss function to drive the training of a
deep Koopman network for linearization. To obtain system information devoid of
individual information from observation data, we leverage the unscented Kalman
filter and the unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. To achieve collaboration
between clients, we adopt the federated learning framework and develop a
modified FedAvg algorithm to orchestrate the collaboration. A convergence
analysis of the proposed framework is also presented. Finally, through
extensive numerical simulations, we showcase the performance of KF-FedKL under
various situations.

Result: 在信道估计、活动识别和用户定位中表现优异，显著减少可训练参数。

Conclusion: LVM4CSI是一种通用且高效的框架，避免了任务特定设计和大规模数据需求。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of
wireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and
complexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial
intelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and
utilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks
(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting
their generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we
propose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the
structural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly
apply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to
wireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language
model-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI
tasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats
compatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt
extracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI
through three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human
activity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI
achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an
improvement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%
reduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the
number of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN
design.

Main category: cs.MA

Motivation: 尽管LLM-MAS在协作中表现出色，但其通信与协调中的安全风险尚未充分探索。本文填补了这一空白，系统研究了意图隐藏威胁。

Method: 设计了四种代表性的攻击范式，并在集中式、分散式和分层通信结构中进行评估。提出了基于HEXACO人格模型和Reid技术的检测框架AgentXposed。

Result: 实验显示攻击具有较强的破坏性，而AgentXposed能有效识别所有恶意行为，但意图隐藏攻击检测率略低于基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了意图隐藏攻击的结构和行为风险，为通过心理学视角保障LLM-MAS安全提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLM-MAS) demonstrate
remarkable capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. While LLM-MAS exhibit
strong collaborative abilities, the security risks in their communication and
coordination remain underexplored. We bridge this gap by systematically
investigating intention-hiding threats in LLM-MAS, and design four
representative attack paradigms that subtly disrupt task completion while
maintaining high concealment. These attacks are evaluated in centralized,
decentralized, and layered communication structures. Experiments conducted on
six benchmark datasets, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro, HumanEval, GSM8K, arithmetic,
and biographies, demonstrate that they exhibit strong disruptive capabilities.
To identify these threats, we propose a psychology-based detection framework
AgentXposed, which combines the HEXACO personality model with the Reid
Technique, using progressive questionnaire inquiries and behavior-based
monitoring. Experiments conducted on six types of attacks show that our
detection framework effectively identifies all types of malicious behaviors.
The detection rate for our intention-hiding attacks is slightly lower than that
of the two baselines, Incorrect Fact Injection and Dark Traits Injection,
demonstrating the effectiveness of intention concealment. Our findings reveal
the structural and behavioral risks posed by intention-hiding attacks and offer
valuable insights into securing LLM-based multi-agent systems through
psychological perspectives, which contributes to a deeper understanding of
multi-agent safety. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: 动态网络推断方法为领导动态分析提供了一种更鲁棒的替代方案，尤其在数据有限或噪声较大的场景中。

Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge
in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional
information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and
Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer
leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or
short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability
estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference
using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity,
acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs
over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need
for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate
our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek
model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and
independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the
network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited
spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence
metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.

Main category: cs.MA

Motivation: 自然灾害频发且严重性增加，机场在救灾中成为重要枢纽，但信息不对称和资源不足导致其成为瓶颈，缺乏相关研究。

Method: 创建基于代理的模型，模拟不同信息不确定性下的现实卸载策略，并通过专家校准和验证模型。

Result: 单个未计划飞机的影响可忽略，但更多未计划飞机会显著增加所有等待时间。

Conclusion: 未计划飞机的增加对机场操作性能有显著负面影响，需优化资源分配和信息管理。

Abstract: The severity of natural disasters is increasing every year, impacting many
people's lives. During the response phase of disasters, airports are important
hubs where relief aid arrives and people need to be evacuated. However, the
airport often forms a bottleneck in these relief operations due to the sudden
need for increased capacity. Limited research has been done on the operational
side of airport disaster management. Experts identify the main problems as,
first, the asymmetry of information between the airport and incoming flights,
and second, the lack of resources. The goal of this research is to understand
the effects of incomplete knowledge of incoming flights with different resource
allocation strategies on the performance of cargo handling operations at an
airport after a natural disaster. An agent-based model is created, implementing
realistic offloading strategies with different degrees of information
uncertainty. Model calibration and verification are performed with experts in
the field. The model performance is measured by the average turnaround time,
which is divided into offloading time, boarding time, and cumulative waiting
times. The results show that the effects of one unplanned aircraft are
negligible. However, all waiting times increase with more arriving unplanned
aircraft.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent
systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability,
robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world
tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable,
or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing
next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire,
an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI
teaming CREW simulation platform, CREW-Wildfire offers procedurally generated
wildfire response scenarios featuring large maps, heterogeneous agents, partial
observability, stochastic dynamics, and long-horizon planning objectives. The
environment supports both low-level control and high-level natural language
interactions through modular Perception and Execution modules. We implement and
evaluate several state-of-the-art LLM-based multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks,
uncovering significant performance gaps that highlight the unsolved challenges
in large-scale coordination, communication, spatial reasoning, and long-horizon
planning under uncertainty. By providing more realistic complexity, scalable
architecture, and behavioral evaluation metrics, CREW-Wildfire establishes a
critical foundation for advancing research in scalable multi-agent Agentic
intelligence. All code, environments, data, and baselines will be released to
support future research in this emerging domain.

Conclusion: 该方法为非晶材料的设计和模拟提供了新途径，解决了以往计算方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and
inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex
structures such as amorphous materials. Here, we present a diffusion model that
reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than
conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data
sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order,
sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by
simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation
allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to
uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures.
Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and
properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how
synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods
provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials
previously inaccessible to computational methods.

TL;DR: KZImputer是一种新型自适应单变量时间序列插补方法，针对短至中等长度缺失段（1-5点及以上）设计，提供了针对序列起始、中间或结尾段的定制策略。它结合线性插值和局部统计量，在各种缺失场景中表现出色，尤其在高达50%或更高缺失率的数据集中稳定性强。

Motivation: 为解决传统插补方法在高缺失率或序列不同位置缺失时的准确性问题，KZImputer提出位置感知的混合策略，旨在提升后续时间序列分析的数据质量。

Method: KZImputer通过区分序列起始、中间或结尾的缺失段，分别应用定制化技术（如线性插值与局部统计），并基于周边数据特征和缺口大小动态调整方法。

Result: 实证分析显示，KZImputer在高缺失率（约50%以上）数据中表现尤为突出，统计与信号重建指标稳定优于传统方法，显著缓解高稀疏场景下的精度下降问题。

Conclusion: KZImputer通过位置自适应与混合插补策略，显著提升了时间序列数据的完整性，特别适合高缺失率或复杂缺失模式的场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces KZImputer, a novel adaptive imputation method for
univariate time series designed for short to medium-sized missed points (gaps)
(1-5 points and beyond) with tailored strategies for segments at the start,
middle, or end of the series. KZImputer employs a hybrid strategy to handle
various missing data scenarios. Its core mechanism differentiates between gaps
at the beginning, middle, or end of the series, applying tailored techniques at
each position to optimize imputation accuracy. The method leverages linear
interpolation and localized statistical measures, adapting to the
characteristics of the surrounding data and the gap size. The performance of
KZImputer has been systematically evaluated against established imputation
techniques, demonstrating its potential to enhance data quality for subsequent
time series analysis. This paper describes the KZImputer methodology in detail
and discusses its effectiveness in improving the integrity of time series data.
Empirical analysis demonstrates that KZImputer achieves particularly strong
performance for datasets with high missingness rates (around 50% or more),
maintaining stable and competitive results across statistical and
signal-reconstruction metrics. The method proves especially effective in
high-sparsity regimes, where traditional approaches typically experience
accuracy degradation.

Method: 提出RPST检验，利用秩变换和百分位修正，并分析其渐近分布、隐私性及统计性质。

Result: RPST检验满足差分隐私，类型I误差可控，秩变换增长率影响统计效力与敏感性。模拟实验验证参数选择优于其他框架。

Conclusion: RPST是有效的隐私保护秩检验方法，且技术可改进其他隐私检验（如符号秩检验）。

Abstract: We develop a class of differentially private two-sample scale tests, called
the rank-transformed percentile-modified Siegel--Tukey tests, or RPST tests.
These RPST tests are inspired both by recent differentially private extensions
of some common rank tests and some older modifications to non-private rank
tests. We present the asymptotic distribution of the RPST test statistic under
the null hypothesis, under a very general condition on the rank transformation.
We also prove RPST tests are differentially private, and that their type I
error does not exceed the given level. We uncover that the growth rate of the
rank transformation presents a tradeoff between power and sensitivity. We do
extensive simulations to investigate the effects of the tuning parameters and
compare to a general private testing framework. Lastly, we show that our
techniques can also be used to improve the differentially private signed-rank
test.

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution $\pi$. It
is well known that this can be written as an optimisation problem over the

$\pi$. and The optimisation problem is normally solved through gradient flows
in the space of probability distribution with an appropriate metric. We show
that the Kullback--Leibler divergence is the only divergence in the family of
Bregman divergences whose gradient flow w.r.t. many popular metrics does not
require knowledge of the normalising constant of $\pi$.

Conclusion: 研究证明了在隐私保护环境下，通过创新的查询策略仍能实现高效的广告定向，为隐私与效能平衡提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Major advertising platforms recently increased privacy protections by
limiting advertisers' access to individual-level data. Instead of providing
access to granular raw data, the platforms only allow a limited number of
aggregate queries to a dataset, which is further protected by adding
differentially private noise. This paper studies whether and how advertisers
can design effective targeting policies within these restrictive privacy
preserving data environments. To achieve this, I develop a probabilistic
machine learning method based on Bayesian optimization, which facilitates
dynamic data exploration. Since Bayesian optimization was designed to sample
points from a function to find its maximum, it is not applicable to aggregate
queries and to targeting. Therefore, I introduce two innovations: (i) integral
updating of posteriors which allows to select the best regions of the data to
query rather than individual points and (ii) a targeting-aware acquisition
function that dynamically selects the most informative regions for the
targeting task. I identify the conditions of the dataset and privacy
environment that necessitate the use of such a "smart" querying strategy. I
apply the strategic querying method to the Criteo AI Labs dataset for uplift
modeling (Diemert et al., 2018) that contains visit and conversion data from
14M users. I show that an intuitive benchmark strategy only achieves 33% of the
non-privacy-preserving targeting potential in some cases, while my strategic
querying method achieves 97-101% of that potential, and is statistically
indistinguishable from Causal Forest (Athey et al., 2019): a state-of-the-art
non-privacy-preserving machine learning targeting method.

### [450] [Biaxialformer: Leveraging Channel Independence and Inter-Channel Correlations in EEG Signal Decoding for Predicting Neurological Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02879)

Key words: EEG信号解码, 时空建模, Transformer模型, 神经预后预测, Biaxialformer

TL;DR: 论文提出了Biaxialformer，一种基于两阶段注意力机制的模型，用于解码EEG信号中的时空信息，解决了传统模型中忽略通道间相关性的问题，并在预测昏迷患者神经预后方面表现出色。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.SP

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的模型在处理多通道EEG信号时忽略通道间相关性，导致信息损失和预测准确性下降，尤其是在复杂的神经预后预测任务中。

Method: 提出Biaxialformer，采用两阶段注意力框架独立捕获时间和空间信息，并通过联合学习位置编码和可变感受野的token化模块来优化特征提取。

Result: 在多中心I-CARE数据集上的验证中，Biaxialformer在跨医院场景中表现优异，平均AUC为0.7688，AUPRC为0.8643，F1为0.6518。

Conclusion: Biaxialformer通过解决通道间相关性遗忘问题，显著提升了EEG信号解码的准确性，为神经预后预测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate decoding of EEG signals requires comprehensive modeling of both
temporal dynamics within individual channels and spatial dependencies across
channels. While Transformer-based models utilizing channel-independence (CI)
strategies have demonstrated strong performance in various time series tasks,
they often overlook the inter-channel correlations that are critical in
multivariate EEG signals. This omission can lead to information degradation and
reduced prediction accuracy, particularly in complex tasks such as neurological
outcome prediction. To address these challenges, we propose Biaxialformer,
characterized by a meticulously engineered two-stage attention-based framework.
This model independently captures both sequence-specific (temporal) and
channel-specific (spatial) EEG information, promoting synergy and mutual
reinforcement across channels without sacrificing CI. By employing joint
learning of positional encodings, Biaxialformer preserves both temporal and
spatial relationships in EEG data, mitigating the interchannel correlation
forgetting problem common in traditional CI models. Additionally, a
tokenization module with variable receptive fields balance the extraction of
fine-grained, localized features and broader temporal dependencies. To enhance
spatial feature extraction, we leverage bipolar EEG signals, which capture
inter-hemispheric brain interactions, a critical but often overlooked aspect in
EEG analysis. Our study broadens the use of Transformer-based models by
addressing the challenge of predicting neurological outcomes in comatose
patients. Using the multicenter I-CARE data from five hospitals, we validate
the robustness and generalizability of Biaxialformer with an average AUC
0.7688, AUPRC 0.8643, and F1 0.6518 in a cross-hospital scenario.

Main category: eess.SP

Motivation: 工业环境中UWB定位因NLOS和多路径效应导致精度下降，传统方法因排除NLOS链路而不适用于多数链路为NLOS的场景。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的TDoA校正方法，引入CIR排序、分块和位置编码策略，分析其可扩展性和性能提升。

Result: 在几乎全是NLOS信号的复杂环境中，定位精度达到0.39米，较TDoA基线提升73.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了NLOS环境下的UWB定位问题，显著提高了精度和实用性。

Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, UWB-based localization systems suffer
inaccuracies when deployed in industrial locations with many obstacles due to
multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. In such
environments, current error mitigation approaches for time difference of
arrival (TDoA) localization typically exclude NLOS links. However, this
exclusion approach leads to geometric dilution of precision problems and this
approach is infeasible when the majority of links are NLOS. To address these
limitations, we propose a transformer-based TDoA position correction method
that uses raw channel impulse responses (CIRs) from all available anchor nodes
to compute position corrections. We introduce different CIR ordering, patching
and positional encoding strategies for the transformer, and analyze each
proposed technique's scalability and performance gains. Based on experiments on
real-world UWB measurements, our approach can provide accuracies of up to 0.39
m in a complex environment consisting of (almost) only NLOS signals, which is
an improvement of 73.6 % compared to the TDoA baseline.

Abstract: Perception-related tasks often arise in autonomous systems operating under
partial observability. This work studies the problem of synthesizing optimal
policies for complex perception-related objectives in environments modeled by
partially observable Markov decision processes. To formally specify such
objectives, we introduce \emph{co-safe linear inequality temporal logic}
(sc-iLTL), which can define complex tasks that are formed by the logical
concatenation of atomic propositions as linear inequalities on the belief space
of the POMDPs. Our solution to the control synthesis problem is to transform
the \mbox{sc-iLTL} objectives into reachability objectives by constructing the
product of the belief MDP and a deterministic finite automaton built from the
sc-iLTL objective. To overcome the scalability challenge due to the product, we
introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method that converges in probability
to the optimal policy. Finally, a drone-probing case study demonstrates the
applicability of our method.

Abstract: Modeling the decision-making behavior of vehicles presents unique challenges,
particularly during unprotected left turns at intersections, where the
uncertainty of human drivers is especially pronounced. In this context,
connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) technology emerges as a promising avenue for
effectively managing such interactions while ensuring safety and efficiency.
Traditional approaches, often grounded in game theory assumptions of perfect
rationality, may inadequately capture the complexities of real-world scenarios
and drivers' decision-making errors. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
decision-making model for vehicle unprotected left-turn scenarios, integrating
game theory with considerations for drivers' bounded rationality. Our model,
formulated as a two-player normal-form game solved by a quantal response
equilibrium (QRE), offers a more nuanced depiction of driver decision-making
processes compared to Nash equilibrium (NE) models. Leveraging an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm coupled with a subtle neural network
trained on precise microscopic vehicle trajectory data, we optimize model
parameters to accurately reflect drivers' interaction-aware bounded rationality
and driving styles. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model in capturing the
interaction-aware bounded rationality and decision tendencies between players.
The proposed model proves to be more realistic and efficient than NE models in
unprotected left-turn scenarios. Our findings contribute valuable insights into
the vehicle decision-making behaviors with bounded rationality, thereby
informing the development of more robust and realistic autonomous driving
systems.

Abstract: Advancing the dynamics inference of power electronic systems (PES) to the
real-time edge-side holds transform-ative potential for testing, control, and

continu-ous-discrete dynamics on resource-constrained edge hardware remains a
significant challenge. This letter pro-poses a neural substitute solver (NSS)

inference with significantly reduced computational costs. Specifically, NSS
leverages lightweight neural networks to substitute time-consuming matrix
operation and high-order numerical integration steps in traditional solvers,
which transforms sequential bottlenecks into highly parallel operation suitable
for edge hardware. Experimental vali-dation on a multi-stage DC-DC converter
demonstrates that NSS achieves 23x speedup and 60% hardware resource reduction
compared to traditional solvers, paving the way for deploying edge inference of

### [457] [Does Overnight News Explain Overnight Returns?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04481)
*Paul Glasserman,Kriste Krstovski,Paul Laliberte,Harry Mamaysky*

Key words: 美股市场，隔夜收益，新闻分析，监督主题分析，市场反应

TL;DR: 美股市场过去30年的收益主要来自隔夜交易，而日内交易收益为负或持平。研究发现，新闻特征能解释这一现象，基于240万篇新闻的分析表明，新闻主题的时间变化和市场对新闻的不同反应是主因。

Main category: q-fin.TR

Motivation: 研究美股市场过去30年日内与隔夜收益差异的原因，探究新闻对市场的影响机制。

Method: 使用240万篇新闻数据，采用一种新颖的监督主题分析技术，选择能解释市场收益的新闻主题。

Result: 新闻主题的流行时间变化及市场对新闻的不同反应共同导致日内与隔夜收益差异，并在样本外测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 新闻是解释美股隔夜收益显著高于日内收益的关键因素，同时有助于理解收益的延续与反转模式。

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, nearly all the gains in the U.S. stock market have
been earned overnight, while average intraday returns have been negative or
flat. We find that a large part of this effect can be explained through
features of intraday and overnight news. Our analysis uses a collection of 2.4
million news articles. We apply a novel technique for supervised topic analysis
that selects news topics based on their ability to explain contemporaneous
market returns. We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics
and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the
difference in intraday and overnight returns. In out-of-sample tests, our
approach forecasts which stocks will do particularly well overnight and
particularly poorly intraday. Our approach also helps explain patterns of
continuation and reversal in intraday and overnight returns. We contrast the
effect of news with other mechanisms proposed in the literature to explain
overnight returns.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: math.NA

Motivation: 提高WSciML在系统识别中的性能，通过优化测试函数集以减少积分误差并提升参数估计的准确性。

Method: 提出数据驱动方法构建单尺度局部参考函数，通过数值近似确定积分误差最小的支持大小。

Result: 实验表明，所选支持大小与参数估计误差最小区域一致，计算效率优于多尺度全局测试函数策略。

Conclusion: 新方法在噪声水平和时间分辨率变化下均表现稳健，计算效率更高，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Weak form Scientific Machine Learning (WSciML) is a recently developed
framework for data-driven modeling and scientific discovery. It leverages the
weak form of equation error residuals to provide enhanced noise robustness in
system identification via convolving model equations with test functions,
reformulating the problem to avoid direct differentiation of data. The
performance, however, relies on wisely choosing a set of compactly supported
test functions.
  In this work, we mathematically motivate a novel data-driven method for
constructing Single-scale-Local reference functions for creating the set of
test functions. Our approach numerically approximates the integration error
introduced by the quadrature and identifies the support size for which the
error is minimal, without requiring access to the model parameter values.
Through numerical experiments across various models, noise levels, and temporal
resolutions, we demonstrate that the selected supports consistently align with
regions of minimal parameter estimation error. We also compare the proposed
method against the strategy for constructing Multi-scale-Global (and
orthogonal) test functions introduced in our prior work, demonstrating the
improved computational efficiency.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何利用紧凑潜在表示和时间动态模型来高效模拟复杂物理系统，特别是在低维空间中捕捉时间动态的有效性及其理论依据。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架，并通过逐步增加模型复杂性的方法（从最小二乘回归到GANs）验证其有效性。实验数据集包括热方程、波动方程、混沌2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程和2D K\'arm\'an涡街CFD数据集。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过紧凑潜在表示和时间动态学习可以有效模拟复杂物理系统，尤其是在低维空间中进行标记化具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the use of compact latent representations with
learned time dynamics ('World Models') to simulate physical systems. Drawing on
concepts from control theory, we propose a theoretical framework that explains
why projecting time slices into a low-dimensional space and then concatenating
to form a history ('Tokenization') is so effective at learning physics
datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a
reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the
next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing
complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through
simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale
generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety
of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the
chaotic regime 2D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a challenging
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) dataset of a 2D K\'arm\'an vortex street
around a fixed cylinder, where our model is successfully able to recreate the
flow.

Result: 数值实验表明该方法在网格细化时收敛，且性能优于两种参考方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过机器学习简化了多材料流动模拟，性能优越且可扩展性强。

Abstract: We present a machine-learning based Volume Of Fluid method to simulate
multi-material flows on three-dimensional domains. One of the novelties of the
method is that the flux fraction is computed by evaluating a previously trained
neural network and without explicitly reconstructing any local interface
approximating the exact one. The network is trained on a purely synthetic
dataset generated by randomly sampling numerous local interfaces and which can
be adapted to improve the scheme on less regular interfaces when needed.
Several strategies to ensure the efficiency of the method and the satisfaction
of physical constraints and properties are suggested and formalized. Numerical
results on the advection equation are provided to show the performance of the
method. We observe numerical convergence as the size of the mesh tends to zero
$h=1/N_h\searrow 0$, with a better rate than two reference schemes.

Abstract: This study explores how Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, guided by
human aesthetic evaluations, can enhance the outputs of generative AI models in
tangible product design, using lamp design as a case study. By integrating
human feedback into the AI model, we aim to improve both the desirability and

fine-tuning effectively aligns AI-generated designs with human aesthetic
preferences, leading to significant improvements in desirability and aesthetic
appeal scores. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration
in tangible product design and provide valuable insights into integrating human
feedback into AI design processes.

Method: 提出一种基于用户偏好计算最优权重的原则性方法，并使用雷达图和UMAP降维技术进行可视化。

Result: 在行人流引导规划中，该方法成功识别了不同用户偏好下控制参数的重要性模式。

Conclusion: 该方法在多指标问题中有效且直观地支持用户偏好选择。

Abstract: Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) are a prevalent method to interpret the
relationship between the control parameters and metrics. PCPs deliver such an
interpretation by color gradation based on a single metric. However, it is
challenging to provide such a gradation when multiple metrics are present.
Although a naive approach involves calculating a single metric by linearly
weighting each metric, such weighting is unclear for users. To address this
problem, we first propose a principled formulation for calculating the optimal
weight based on a specific preferred metric combination. Although users can
simply select their preference from a two-dimensional (2D) plane for bi-metric
problems, multi-metric problems require intuitive visualization to allow them
to select their preference. We achieved this using various radar charts to
visualize the metric trade-offs on the 2D plane reduced by UMAP. In the
analysis using pedestrian flow guidance planning, our method identified unique
patterns of control parameter importance for each user preference, highlighting
the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals need effective ways to use, understand, and validate
AI-driven clinical decision support systems. Existing systems face two key
limitations: complex visualizations and a lack of grounding in scientific
evidence. We present an integrated decision support system that combines
interactive visualizations with a conversational agent to explain diabetes risk
assessments. We propose a hybrid prompt handling approach combining fine-tuned
language models for analytical queries with general Large Language Models
(LLMs) for broader medical questions, a methodology for grounding AI
explanations in scientific evidence, and a feature range analysis technique to
support deeper understanding of feature contributions. We conducted a
mixed-methods study with 30 healthcare professionals and found that the
conversational interactions helped healthcare professionals build a clear
understanding of model assessments, while the integration of scientific
evidence calibrated trust in the system's decisions. Most participants reported
that the system supported both patient risk evaluation and recommendation.

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 当前数字人类动画的瓶颈在于如何根据文本或语音输入生成自然的角色动作。这项研究旨在通过多模态信号生成更具表现力和语义对齐的手势。

Method: DeepGesture基于DiffuseStyleGesture模型，引入快速文本转录作为语义条件，采用情感引导的无分类器扩散方法，并使用轻量级Transformer架构融合多模态特征。

Result: 在ZeroEGGS数据集上的评估显示，DeepGesture在手势的逼真度和上下文适切性上优于基线模型，并在情感状态插值和合成语音上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DeepGesture为完全多模态、情感感知的数字人类动画迈出了重要一步，展示了在手势生成中的显著改进和应用潜力。

Abstract: Along with the explosion of large language models, improvements in speech
synthesis, advancements in hardware, and the evolution of computer graphics,
the current bottleneck in creating digital humans lies in generating character
movements that correspond naturally to text or speech inputs.
  In this work, we present DeepGesture, a diffusion-based gesture synthesis
framework for generating expressive co-speech gestures conditioned on
multimodal signals-text, speech, emotion, and seed motion. Built upon the
DiffuseStyleGesture model, DeepGesture introduces novel architectural
enhancements that improve semantic alignment and emotional expressiveness in
generated gestures. Specifically, we integrate fast text transcriptions as
semantic conditioning and implement emotion-guided classifier-free diffusion to
support controllable gesture generation across affective states. A lightweight
Transformer backbone combines full self-attention and cross-local attention for
effective feature fusion of heterogeneous modalities. To visualize results, we
implement a full rendering pipeline in Unity based on BVH output from the
model. Evaluation on the ZeroEGGS dataset shows that DeepGesture produces
gestures with improved human-likeness and contextual appropriateness,
outperforming baselines on Mean Opinion Score and Frechet Gesture Distance
metrics. Our system supports interpolation between emotional states and
demonstrates generalization to out-of-distribution speech, including synthetic
voices-marking a step forward toward fully multimodal, emotionally aware
digital humans.

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 研究如何通过界面设计增加用户提示长度，从而提升用户对生成内容的心理所有权。

Method: 实验一测试了两种交互技术（按压按钮和滑动滑块）对提示长度和心理所有权的影响；实验二在此基础上增加了AI生成建议的功能。

Result: 交互技术显著增加了提示长度并提高了心理所有权；AI生成建议进一步增加了提示长度，但对心理所有权无显著影响。

Conclusion: 简单界面修改能有效增加用户输入并提升心理所有权。

Abstract: Writing longer prompts for an AI assistant to generate a short story
increases psychological ownership, a user's feeling that the writing belongs to
them. To encourage users to write longer prompts, we evaluated two interaction
techniques that modify the prompt entry interface of chat-based generative AI
assistants: pressing and holding the prompt submission button, and continuously
moving a slider up and down when submitting a short prompt. A within-subjects
experiment investigated the effects of such techniques on prompt length and
psychological ownership, and results showed that these techniques increased
prompt length and led to higher psychological ownership than baseline
techniques. A second experiment further augmented these techniques by showing
AI-generated suggestions for how the prompts could be expanded. This further
increased prompt length, but did not lead to improvements in psychological
ownership. Our results show that simple interface modifications like these can
elicit more writing from users and improve psychological ownership.

published between 2022 and 2025. We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4,
Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from
ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering,
human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping
design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and
limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging
collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive,

Result: 通过流程实施，可以区分真实计算现象与测量伪影，为AI心理学研究奠定实证基础。

Conclusion: 系统验证和透明实践是确保LLM在心理学研究中有效性的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into psychological
research as research tools, evaluation targets, human simulators, and cognitive
models. However, recent evidence reveals severe measurement unreliability:
Personality assessments collapse under factor analysis, moral preferences
reverse with punctuation changes, and theory-of-mind accuracy varies widely
with trivial rephrasing. These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts
masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing
body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates
psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that
scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text
requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological
properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1)
explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements,
(2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric
testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4)
execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate
for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated
boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through
an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic
validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement
artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent
practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical
foundation for AI psychology research.

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 现有AI创意工具缺乏对发散与收敛过程的复杂协调支持，Reverger旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 工具支持递归探索（发散）和合成具体变体（收敛），用户可以迭代直到满意。

Result: 研究表明，Reverger用户能探索更多意外且多样化的方向，并感受到更精细的控制。

Conclusion: Reverger有效支持创意过程中发散与收敛的协调，提升用户成果质量。

Abstract: Human creative ideation involves both exploration of diverse ideas
(divergence) and selective synthesis of explored ideas into coherent
combinations (convergence). While processes of divergence and convergence are
often interleaved and nested, existing AI-powered creativity support tools
(CSTs) lack support for sophisticated orchestration of divergence and
convergence. We present Reverger, an AI-powered CST that helps users ideate
variations of conceptual directions for modifying a story by scaffolding
flexible iteration between divergence and convergence. For divergence, our tool
enables recursive exploration of alternative high-level directions for
modifying a specific part of the original story. For convergence, it allows
users to collect explored high-level directions and synthesize them into
concrete variations. Users can then iterate between divergence and convergence
until they find a satisfactory outcome. A within-subject study revealed that
Reverger permitted participants to explore more unexpected and diverse
high-level directions than a comparable baseline. Reverger users also felt that
they had more fine-grained control and discovered more effort-worthy outcomes.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育工具中的普及，研究其交互方式对用户体验和学习效果的影响具有重要意义。

Method: 采用被试内实验设计，15名高中生分别在三种交互模式下完成编程任务，并进行定量分析。

Result: 协作式交互显著缩短任务完成时间，且用户满意度和感知帮助性更高。

Conclusion: 设计更互动和用户中心的LLM对新手程序员尤为重要。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and
programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should
interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles
with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance
on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where
fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under
three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a
specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions
automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative
analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly
improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions.
Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when
working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an
LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact
learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing
LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive,
adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.

researchers to conclude that, like any other AI-based technology, these robots
must also be human-centered to meet the needs of their users. This chapter aims
to introduce humans and their needs in interactions with robots, ranging from
short-term, one-on-one interactions (micro-level) to long-term, macro-level
needs at the societal scale. Building upon the principles of human-centered AI,
this chapter presents, for the first time, a new framework of human needs
called the Dual Pyramid. This framework encompasses a comprehensive list of
human needs in robot interactions, from the most fundamental, robot
effectiveness to macro level requirements, such as the collaboration with
robots in achieving the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

### [473] [Infrastructuring Contestability: A Framework for Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05187)
*Andreas Mayer*

Key words: AI价值对齐、社区定义、价值多元化、用户代理、HCI、CSCW

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为社区定义AI价值多元化的框架（CDAVP），旨在解决AI系统中用户代理和价值多元化的缺失问题，通过社区自治和动态价值生态系统实现更具包容性和可争议性的AI设计。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 当前AI系统的价值对齐方法缺乏用户和社区的参与，导致信任危机和合法性缺失，需要一种新的框架来支持价值多元化和用户代理。

Method: 采用CDAVP框架，允许社区定义和维护机器可读的价值配置文件，用户控制激活哪些价值观，AI系统透明地解释和调解冲突。

Result: CDAVP增强了用户代理，支持价值多元化和社区参与，提升了AI系统的可争议性和包容性。

Conclusion: 通过社区主导的价值多元化和动态生态系统设计，可实现更具责任感和以人为中心的AI。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-driven systems presents a fundamental challenge to
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work
(CSCW), often diminishing user agency and failing to account for value
pluralism. Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,
top-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This
leaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded
in the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy
and trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),
a socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design
problem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic
ecosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables
diverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value
profiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only
preferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are
then contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control
(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,
are designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,
adhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The
designer's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect
of participatory ecosystems. We argue that infrastructuring for pluralism is a
necessary pathway toward achieving robust algorithmic accountability and
genuinely contestable, human-centric AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 现有eLearning平台宣称能提升学生自我调节学习(SRL)，但SRL的循环性和无方向性使其难以用现代机器学习框架建模。

Method: 应用基于SRL的特征追踪学生数据，以改进SRL活动的建模，并分析学习效果的因果关系。

Result: 结果显示这些特征提高了预测准确性，验证了循环建模技术在SRL研究中的价值。

Conclusion: 研究表明SRL特征的引入有助于提升eLearning环境中学习效果的预测和解释，鼓励进一步探索循环建模技术。

Abstract: Many e-learning platforms assert their ability or potential to improve
students' self-regulated learning (SRL), however the cyclical and undirected
nature of SRL theoretical models represent significant challenges for
representation within contemporary machine learning frameworks. We apply
SRL-informed features to trace data in order to advance modelling of students'
SRL activities, to improve predictability and explainability regarding the
causal effects of learning in an eLearning environment. We demonstrate that
these features improve predictive accuracy and validate the value of further
research into cyclic modelling techniques for SRL.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在教育评估中的潜力及其限制，特别是在STEM学科中的表现。

Method: 使用201个大学STEM问题数据集，分析图像类型、问题复杂度等特征对AI和学生表现的影响，评估四种模型家族和五种提示策略。

Result: 最佳AI模型平均正确率为58.5%，但人类在视觉相关问题上表现更好；AI表现受学科和问题特征影响，而人类表现稳定。

Conclusion: 通过优化问题设计，可以在不影响学生认知负担的情况下挑战AI系统，从而提升学术诚信。

Abstract: Generative AI systems have rapidly advanced, with multimodal input
capabilities enabling reasoning beyond text-based tasks. In education, these
advancements could influence assessment design and question answering,
presenting both opportunities and challenges. To investigate these effects, we
introduce a high-quality dataset of 201 university-level STEM questions,
manually annotated with features such as image type, role, problem complexity,
and question format. Our study analyzes how these features affect generative AI
performance compared to students. We evaluate four model families with five
prompting strategies, comparing results to the average of 546 student responses
per question. Although the best model correctly answers on average 58.5 % of
the questions using majority vote aggregation, human participants consistently
outperform AI on questions involving visual components. Interestingly, human
performance remains stable across question features but varies by subject,
whereas AI performance is susceptible to both subject matter and question
features. Finally, we provide actionable insights for educators, demonstrating
how question design can enhance academic integrity by leveraging features that
challenge current AI systems without increasing the cognitive burden for
students.

Method: 通过构建一个包含多模态（文本和图像）问题的双语数据集，并系统评估当前最先进的LLM模型在数据集上的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在理论和编程任务中的表现存在差异，语言选择（英语或罗马尼亚语）对结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在计算机科学教育中的适用性和局限性，并提出了关于教育公平和评估完整性的伦理问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed various
domains, particularly computer science (CS) education. These models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks and problem-solving, raising
questions about their potential and limitations in advanced CS contexts. This
study presents a novel bilingual (English-Romanian) multimodal (text and image)
dataset of multiple-choice questions derived from a high-level computer science
competition. A particularity of our dataset is that the problems are conceived
such that some of them are easier solved using reasoning on paper, while for
others writing code is more efficient. We systematically evaluate State of The
Art LLMs on this dataset, analyzing their performance on theoretical
programming tasks. Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current
LLMs, including the influence of language choice (English vs. Romanian),
providing insights into their applicability in CS education and competition
settings. We also address critical ethical considerations surrounding
educational integrity and the fairness of assessments in the context of LLM
usage. These discussions aim to inform future educational practices and
policies. To support further research, our dataset will be made publicly
available in both English and Romanian. Additionally, we release an educational
application tailored for Romanian students, enabling them to self-assess using
the dataset in an interactive and practice-oriented environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 探讨英国如何在促进AI创新与经济利益的同时，有效管理其潜在风险。

Method: 提出建立灵活、基于原则的监管机构，加强防御措施，并更新法律框架以应对AI带来的挑战。

Result: 英国可通过正确监管展示民主社会如何在利用AI优势的同时管控风险。

Conclusion: 建议英国进一步完善监管体系，平衡创新与风险，以成为全球AI治理的典范。

Abstract: The UK has pursued a distinctive path in AI regulation: less cautious than
the EU but more willing to address risks than the US, and has emerged as a
global leader in coordinating AI safety efforts. Impressive developments from
companies like London-based DeepMind began to spark concerns in the UK about
catastrophic risks from around 2012, although regulatory discussion at the time
focussed on bias and discrimination. By 2022, these discussions had evolved
into a "pro-innovation" strategy, in which the government directed existing
regulators to take a light-touch approach, governing AI at point of use, but
avoided regulating the technology or infrastructure directly. ChatGPT arrived
in late 2022, galvanising concerns that this approach may be insufficient. The
UK responded by establishing an AI Safety Institute to monitor risks and
hosting the first international AI Safety Summit in 2023, but - unlike the EU -
refrained from regulating frontier AI development in addition to its use. A new
government was elected in 2024 which promised to address this gap, but at the
time of writing is yet to do so.
  What should the UK do next? The government faces competing objectives:
harnessing AI for economic growth and better public services while mitigating
risk. In light of these, we propose establishing a flexible, principles-based
regulator to oversee the most advanced AI development, defensive measures
against risks from AI-enabled biological design tools, and argue that more
technical work is needed to understand how to respond to AI-generated
misinformation. We argue for updated legal frameworks on copyright,
discrimination, and AI agents, and that regulators will have a limited but
important role if AI substantially disrupts labour markets.
  If the UK gets AI regulation right, it could demonstrate how democratic
societies can harness AI's benefits while managing its risks.

Method: 通过分析研究员电脑中的文本数据（如文章、邮件、草稿等），使用预训练模型（如GPT-4）进行微调，以复制其写作风格和专业领域知识。

Result: 研究结果表明，数据量足够支持AI高保真地复制研究员的风格与知识，并提出通过非文本数据和元数据进一步优化。

Conclusion: AI驱动的电子版研究员在智力遗产保存和决策优化方面具有潜力，但所有权与安全等伦理问题需优先考虑。

Abstract: This article explores the feasibility of creating an "electronic copy" of a
deceased researcher by training artificial intelligence (AI) on the data stored
in their personal computers. By analyzing typical data volumes on inherited
researcher computers, including textual files such as articles, emails, and
drafts, it is estimated that approximately one million words are available for
AI training. This volume is sufficient for fine-tuning advanced pre-trained
models like GPT-4 to replicate a researcher's writing style, domain expertise,
and rhetorical voice with high fidelity. The study also discusses the potential
enhancements from including non-textual data and file metadata to enrich the
AI's representation of the researcher. Extensions of the concept include
communication between living researchers and their electronic copies,
collaboration among individual electronic copies, as well as the creation and
interconnection of organizational electronic copies to optimize information
access and strategic decision-making. Ethical considerations such as ownership
and security of these electronic copies are highlighted as critical for
responsible implementation. The findings suggest promising opportunities for
AI-driven preservation and augmentation of intellectual legacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶技术（如SAE 1-6级）虽具备自主性，但仍无法满足未来人本流动性系统所需的认知和社交能力，因此需要引入‘代理性车辆’概念。

Method: 提出了一个系统级框架，从认知和通信层面区分AgVs与传统AuVs，并结合AI代理、机器人学和多智能体系统的进展。

Result: 展示了AgVs如何通过高级推理和工具使用，成为嵌入流动性生态系统中的交互式代理。

Conclusion: 总结了AgVs开发中的关键挑战，包括安全、实时控制、公众接受度、伦理对齐和监管框架。

Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity
to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly,
autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their
environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input.
However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase
vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE
levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation,
contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly
with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems.
These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the
broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered
mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles
(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and
interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level
framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative
layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant
advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine
interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and
tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive
agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key
challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety,
real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory
frameworks.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 城市街道是促进健康公平的重要公共空间，但现有研究缺乏对街道级运动剥夺的系统量化方法。

Method: 整合街景图像、社交媒体等多源数据，采用SHAP分析的机器学习方法，按剥夺模式对街道分类。

Result: 发现老城区以基础设施限制为主，新开发区则存在体验性疏离；针对性改进可提升14%的运动支持性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅在街道尺度上操作化了Lefebvre的空间理论，还为空间公平和城市健康提供了可操作的干预指南。

Abstract: Urban streets are essential public spaces that facilitate everyday physical
activity and promote health equity. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's spatial triad,
this study proposes a conceptual and methodological framework to quantify
street-level exercise deprivation through the dimensions of conceived (planning
and structure), perceived (visual and sensory), and lived (practice and
experiential) urban spaces. We integrate multi-source spatial data-including
street networks, street-view imagery, and social media-using explainable
machine learning (SHAP analysis) to classify streets by their dominant
deprivation modes, forming a novel typology of spatial inequity. Results
highlight significant differences across urban contexts: older city cores
predominantly experience infrastructural constraints (conceived space), whereas
new development areas suffer from experiential disengagement (lived space).
Furthermore, by identifying spatial mismatches between population distribution
and exercise intensity, our study reveals localized clusters of latent
deprivation. Simulation experiments demonstrate that targeted improvements
across spatial dimensions can yield up to 14% increases in exercise
supportiveness. This research not only operationalizes Lefebvre's spatial
theory at the street scale but also provides actionable insights and
intervention guidelines, contributing to the broader goals of spatial justice
and urban health equity.

Motivation: 探讨企业在AI应用中的虚假陈述（夸大或低估）如何影响消费者信任和购买行为，以及背后的伦理问题。

Method: 采用2x2实验设计（N=401），分析消费者对AI洗白行为的反应和道德判断。

Result: 研究发现，低估AI使用的欺骗性否认比诚实否认引发更负面的道德评价，而夸大AI使用的欺骗性吹嘘则无明显影响。背叛感是这些结果的中介因素。

Conclusion: AI洗白行为会损害消费者信任，研究为政策制定者、营销人员和研究者提供了关于透明化的重要启示。

Abstract: As AI hype continues to grow, organizations face pressure to broadcast or
downplay purported AI initiatives - even when contrary to truth. This paper
introduces AI-washing as overstating (deceptive boasting) or understating
(deceptive denial) a company's real AI usage. A 2x2 experiment (N = 401)
examines how these false claims affect consumer attitudes and purchase
intentions. Results reveal a pronounced asymmetry: deceptive denial evokes more
negative moral judgments than honest negation, while deceptive boasting has no
effects. We show that perceived betrayal mediates these outcomes. By clarifying
how AI-washing erodes trust, the study highlights clear ethical implications
for policymakers, marketers, and researchers striving for transparency.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 研究发现社会学在聊天机器人研究领域的参与较少，因此提出社会学理论可以为这一领域提供新的视角，特别是在社会结构和文化影响的背景下。

Method: 论文提出了四种社会学理论（资源替代理论、权力依赖理论、情感控制理论和疾病根本原因理论）来分析人类与聊天机器人的互动。

Result: 这些理论为现有研究提供了新的见解，特别是在聊天机器人使用的驱动因素和其对社会福祉的影响方面。

Conclusion: 应用社会学理论可以推动对人类与聊天机器人互动的理论研究，并开发更具社会价值的聊天机器人。

Abstract: Recently, research into chatbots (also known as conversational agents, AI
agents, voice assistants), which are computer applications using artificial
intelligence to mimic human-like conversation, has grown sharply. Despite this
growth, sociology lags other disciplines (including computer science, medicine,
psychology, and communication) in publishing about chatbots. We suggest
sociology can advance understanding of human-chatbot interaction and offer four
sociological theories to enhance extant work in this field. The first two
theories (resource substitution theory, power-dependence theory) add new
insights to existing models of the drivers of chatbot use, which overlook
sociological concerns about how social structure (e.g., systemic
discrimination, the uneven distribution of resources within networks) inclines
individuals to use chatbots, including problematic levels of emotional
dependency on chatbots. The second two theories (affect control theory,
fundamental cause of disease theory) help inform the development of
chatbot-driven interventions that minimize safety risks and enhance equity by
leveraging sociological insights into how chatbot outputs could attend to
cultural contexts (e.g., affective norms) to promote wellbeing and enhance
communities (e.g., opportunities for civic participation). We discuss the value
of applying sociological theories for advancing theorizing about human-chatbot
interaction and developing chatbots for social good.

Result: 模型能够高效且无偏地生成FRSTs，并能通过自我改进不断提升性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为Calabi-Yau三折叠的系统探索提供了新工具，并推动了AICY社区平台的发展。

Abstract: Fine, regular, and star triangulations (FRSTs) of four-dimensional reflexive
polytopes give rise to toric varieties, within which generic anticanonical
hypersurfaces yield smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds. We employ transformers --
deep learning models originally developed for language modeling -- to generate
FRSTs across a range of polytope sizes. Our models exhibit efficient and
unbiased sampling, and can self-improve through retraining on their own output.
These results lay the foundation for AICY: a community-driven platform that
combines self-improving machine learning models with a continuously expanding
FRST database to explore and catalog the Calabi-Yau landscape.

Main category: cs.NE

Motivation: 解决代理辅助进化算法（SAEAs）中动态选择策略的设计复杂性和对领域知识的高依赖性。

Method: 提出了LLM-SAEA，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为评分专家（LLM-SE）和决策专家（LLM-DE）动态配置代理模型和填充采样标准。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM-SAEA在标准测试案例中优于多种先进算法。

Conclusion: LLM-SAEA通过LLMs的集成，为SAEAs的动态配置提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are a key tool for
addressing costly optimization tasks, with their efficiency being heavily
dependent on the selection of surrogate models and infill sampling criteria.
However, designing an effective dynamic selection strategy for SAEAs is
labor-intensive and requires substantial domain knowledge. To address this
challenge, this paper proposes LLM-SAEA, a novel approach that integrates large
language models (LLMs) to configure both surrogate models and infill sampling
criteria online. Specifically, LLM-SAEA develops a collaboration-of-experts
framework, where one LLM serves as a scoring expert (LLM-SE), assigning scores
to surrogate models and infill sampling criteria based on their optimization
performance, while another LLM acts as a decision expert (LLM-DE), selecting
the appropriate configurations by analyzing their scores along with the current
optimization state. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-SAEA outperforms
several state-of-the-art algorithms across standard test cases. The source code

for quantum circuit synthesis. The results suggest PSO converges more quickly

Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of determining the weights and thresholds
of a neural network using the potential -- a parameter of an electrostatic
field -- without analytical calculations and without applying training
algorithms. The work is based on neural network architectures employing metric
recognition methods. The electrostatic field is simulated in the Builder C++
environment. In the same environment, a neural network based on metric
recognition methods is constructed, with the weights of the first-layer neurons
determined by the values of the potentials of the simulated electrostatic
field. The effectiveness of the resulting neural network within the simulated
system is evaluated using the MNIST test dataset under various initial
conditions of the simulated system. The results demonstrated functional
viability. The implementation of this approach shows that a neural network can
obtain weight values almost instantaneously from the electrostatic field,
without the need for analytical computations, lengthy training procedures, or
massive training datasets.

Key words: SNN、剪枝、强化学习、SynOps、边缘计算

TL;DR: SPEAR是一种基于强化学习的SNN剪枝框架，可直接以SynOps为约束条件，通过LRE预测机制和TAR奖励机制实现高效压缩。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.NE

Motivation: 现有基于搜索的剪枝方法无法直接以动态变化的SynOps为约束，导致最终网络违反预期SynOps目标。

Method: 提出SPEAR框架，结合LRE机制预测SynOps和TAR奖励稳定搜索。

Result: 实验显示SPEAR能有效压缩SNN，满足特定SynOps约束。

Conclusion: SPEAR解决了动态SynOps约束问题，为边缘部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) demonstrate superior performance,
their deployment on resource-constrained neuromorphic hardware still remains
challenging. Network pruning offers a viable solution by reducing both
parameters and synaptic operations (SynOps) to facilitate the edge deployment
of SNNs, among which search-based pruning methods search for the SNNs structure
after pruning. However, existing search-based methods fail to directly use
SynOps as the constraint because it will dynamically change in the searching
process, resulting in the final searched network violating the expected SynOps
target. In this paper, we introduce a novel SNN pruning framework called SPEAR,
which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) technique to directly use SynOps as
the searching constraint. To avoid the violation of SynOps requirements, we
first propose a SynOps prediction mechanism called LRE to accurately predict
the final SynOps after search. Observing SynOps cannot be explicitly calculated
and added to constrain the action in RL, we propose a novel reward called TAR
to stabilize the searching. Extensive experiments show that our SPEAR framework
can effectively compress SNN under specific SynOps constraint.

### [493] [Optimization of Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks Utilizing Historical Dynamics of Refractory Periods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02960)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.NE

Motivation: 在低延迟SNN中，传统不应期机制效果不佳，导致神经元过度激活和噪声敏感性增加。

Method: 提出HDRP模型，利用膜电位导数和历史不应期估计初始不应期并动态调整；引入阈值依赖性不应期核以减少神经元状态积累。

Result: HDRP-SNN显著减少冗余脉冲，在静态和神经形态数据集上达到SOTA准确率，且在噪声抵抗上优于ANN和传统SNN。

Conclusion: HDRP机制在提升低延迟SNN性能中起关键作用。

Abstract: The refractory period controls neuron spike firing rate, crucial for network
stability and noise resistance. With advancements in spiking neural network
(SNN) training methods, low-latency SNN applications have expanded. In
low-latency SNNs, shorter simulation steps render traditional refractory
mechanisms, which rely on empirical distributions or spike firing rates, less
effective. However, omitting the refractory period amplifies the risk of neuron
over-activation and reduces the system's robustness to noise. To address this
challenge, we propose a historical dynamic refractory period (HDRP) model that
leverages membrane potential derivative with historical refractory periods to
estimate an initial refractory period and dynamically adjust its duration.
Additionally, we propose a threshold-dependent refractory kernel to mitigate
excessive neuron state accumulation. Our approach retains the binary
characteristics of SNNs while enhancing both noise resistance and overall
performance. Experimental results show that HDRP-SNN significantly reduces
redundant spikes compared to traditional SNNs, and achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) accuracy both on static datasets and neuromorphic datasets. Moreover,
HDRP-SNN outperforms artificial neural networks (ANNs) and traditional SNNs in
noise resistance, highlighting the crucial role of the HDRP mechanism in
enhancing the performance of low-latency SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.NE

Motivation: 边缘计算场景需要硬件高效的在线持续学习算法以适应动态环境，现有算法常面临高内存开销和对近期任务的偏差问题。

Method: SESLR利用SNN的二进制脉冲特性将重放特征存储在单比特中，并通过受控噪声注入的睡眠阶段训练，缓解分类偏差。

Result: 在Split CIFAR10上，SESLR平均准确率提升近30%，内存消耗仅为基线方法的三分之一；在Split CIFAR10-DVS上，准确率提升约10%，内存开销减少32倍。

Conclusion: SESLR是一种适用于资源受限的边缘计算场景的高效在线持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient
online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment.
However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias
towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a
novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a
sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR
leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single
bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by
biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase
where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise
injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes.
Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic
(NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split
CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only
one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split
CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory
overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising
solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing
scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如GPT-4-mini）驱动的算法发现方法如何生成优化算法，并通过行为空间分析理解其性能差异的原因。

Method: 使用LLaMEA框架和GPT-4-mini模型迭代生成优化启发式算法，并基于BBOB基准测试函数评估。通过动态行为指标、可视化投影和网络表示分析6种LLaMEA变体的行为。

Result: 性能最高的算法采用了代码简化和随机扰动提示策略，表现出较强的利用行为和快速收敛特性。行为空间可视化显示高性能算法具有更少的停滞和更快的收敛。

Conclusion: 行为空间分析可以解释LLM设计的启发式算法性能差异，并为未来设计自适应LLM驱动的算法生成器提供指导。

Abstract: We investigate the behaviour space of meta-heuristic optimisation algorithms
automatically generated by Large Language Model driven algorithm discovery
methods. Using the Large Language Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework
with a GPT o4-mini LLM, we iteratively evolve black-box optimisation
heuristics, evaluated on 10 functions from the BBOB benchmark suite. Six LLaMEA
variants, featuring different mutation prompt strategies, are compared and
analysed. We log dynamic behavioural metrics including exploration,
exploitation, convergence and stagnation measures, for each run, and analyse
these via visual projections and network-based representations. Our analysis
combines behaviour-based
  projections, Code Evolution Graphs built from static code features,
performance convergence curves, and behaviour-based Search Trajectory Networks.
The results reveal clear differences in search dynamics and algorithm
structures across LLaMEA configurations. Notably, the variant that employs both
a code simplification prompt and a random perturbation prompt in a 1+1 elitist
evolution strategy, achieved the best performance, with the highest Area Over
the Convergence Curve. Behaviour-space visualisations show that
higher-performing algorithms exhibit more intensive exploitation behaviour and
faster convergence with less stagnation. Our findings demonstrate how
behaviour-space analysis can explain why certain LLM-designed heuristics
outperform others and how LLM-driven algorithm discovery navigates the
open-ended and complex search space of algorithms. These findings provide
insights to guide the future design of adaptive LLM-driven algorithm
generators.

Method: 提出规范的可复制算法设计方法，包括确定性函数计算和随机阈值比较，并改进基于已知期望和有限方差的统计量设计策略。

Result: 实现了硬币检验和接近性检验的常数倍最优界限，并为均匀性检验和Guassian均值检验提供了高效算法。

Conclusion: 研究为可复制测试算法设计提供了系统化框架，显著提升了效率和适用范围。

Abstract: A hypothesis testing algorithm is replicable if, when run on two different
samples from the same distribution, it produces the same output with high
probability. This notion, defined by by Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi, and Sorell
[STOC'22], can increase trust in testing procedures and is deeply related to
algorithmic stability, generalization, and privacy. We build general tools to
prove lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of replicable testers,
unifying and quantitatively improving upon existing results.
  We identify a set of canonical properties, and prove that any replicable
testing algorithm can be modified to satisfy these properties without worsening
accuracy or sample complexity. A canonical replicable algorithm computes a
deterministic function of its input (i.e., a test statistic) and thresholds
against a uniformly random value in $[0,1]$. It is invariant to the order in
which the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,''
then the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements,
resolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPS'24]. We prove new lower
bounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case
where the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.
  We systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm
design based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.
Our framework allow testers which have been extensively analyzed in the
non-replicable setting to be made replicable with minimal overhead. As direct
applications of our framework, we obtain constant-factor optimal bounds for
coin testing and closeness testing and get replicability for free in a large
parameter regime for uniformity testing.
  We also give state-of-the-art bounds for replicable Gaussian mean testing,
and, unlike prior work, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.

Abstract: We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework
that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to
jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across
competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles
high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. %
Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS}
evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly
favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields
used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior
probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope
and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar
neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference.
% Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain
uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model
selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.

Conclusion: 本研究为可扩展且隐私保护的医疗编码系统提供了可行方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the feasibility and performance of federated learning
(FL) for multi-label ICD code classification using clinical notes from the
MIMIC-IV dataset. Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training
or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable
pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron
(MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and
deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly
suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both
centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly
available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard
and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and
ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits
assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially
outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that
federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized
conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than
state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1
scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the
simplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way
toward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step
toward for future research into federated, domain-adaptive clinical AI.

Method: 使用8种不同的Qwen2.5 7B LLMs（包括基础模型、指令调优模型、代码/数学专业化模型、长推理模型和视觉语言模型），在零样本检索和有监督设置下进行实验。

Result: 数学专业化和长推理能力导致检索效果下降；视觉语言模型和代码专业化模型在零样本检索中表现优异，甚至超越BM25。

Conclusion: 研究发现为跨域和跨模态融合的统一检索任务提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as dense
retrievers, the impact of their domain-specific specialization on retrieval
effectiveness remains underexplored. This investigation systematically examines
how task-specific adaptations in LLMs influence their retrieval capabilities,
an essential step toward developing unified retrievers capable of handling
text, code, images, and multimodal content. We conduct extensive experiments
with eight Qwen2.5 7B LLMs, including base, instruction-tuned,
code/math-specialized, long reasoning, and vision-language models across
zero-shot retrieval settings and the supervised setting. For the zero-shot
retrieval settings, we consider text retrieval from the BEIR benchmark and code
retrieval from the CoIR benchmark. Further, to evaluate supervised performance,
all LLMs are fine-tuned on the MS MARCO dataset. We find that mathematical
specialization and the long reasoning capability cause consistent degradation
in three settings, indicating conflicts between mathematical reasoning and
semantic matching. The vision-language model and code-specialized LLMs
demonstrate superior zero-shot performance compared to other LLMs, even
surpassing BM25 on the code retrieval task, and maintain comparable performance
to base LLMs in supervised settings. These findings suggest promising
directions for the unified retrieval task leveraging cross-domain and
cross-modal fusion.

Abstract: Although the amount of available spoken content is steadily increasing,
extracting information and knowledge from speech recordings remains
challenging. Beyond enhancing traditional information retrieval methods such as
speech search and keyword spotting, novel approaches for navigating and

approach with a Web application that organizes data into a structured format
using interactive mind maps and image generation tools. The system is
implemented using the TED-LIUM~3 dataset, which comprises over 2,000 speech
transcripts and audio files of TED Talks. Initial user tests using a System

Conclusion: GTEs因其强大的表征能力，无需微调即可实现高性能，嵌入压缩可进一步优化效果。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic
representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential
recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata,
while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent.
Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to
improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing
that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale
corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized
adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and
fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We
attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute
features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that
compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions
(e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of
specialized models. To ensure reproducibility, we provide our repository at

Abstract: Feature interaction modeling is crucial for deep recommendation models. A
common and effective approach is to construct explicit feature combinations to
enhance model performance. However, in practice, only a small fraction of these
combinations are truly informative. Thus it is essential to select useful
feature combinations to reduce noise and manage memory consumption. While
feature selection methods have been extensively studied, they are typically
limited to selecting individual features. Extending these methods for
high-order feature combination selection presents a significant challenge due
to the exponential growth in time complexity when evaluating feature
combinations one by one. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{TayFCS}$, a
lightweight feature combination selection method that significantly improves
model performance. Specifically, we propose the Taylor Expansion Scorer
(TayScorer) module for field-wise Taylor expansion on the base model. Instead
of evaluating all potential feature combinations' importance by repeatedly
running experiments with feature adding and removal, this scorer only needs to
approximate the importance based on their sub-components' gradients. This can
be simply computed with one backward pass based on a trained recommendation
model. To further reduce information redundancy among feature combinations and
their sub-components, we introduce Logistic Regression Elimination (LRE), which
estimates the corresponding information gain based on the model prediction
performance. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B test
results demonstrate its practical applicability and commercial value.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start
problem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on
transferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the
target domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the
underutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain
alignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target
domain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space
distribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal
data and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first
employ a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features
and leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt
learning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion
module to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This
approach involves learning feature distribution from side users and
understanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping
users. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature
vectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of
cross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the
Amazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming all selected baselines. Our code is available:

Abstract: Modern sequential recommender systems commonly use transformer-based models
for next-item prediction. While these models demonstrate a strong balance
between efficiency and quality, integrating interleaving features - such as the
query context (e.g., browse category) under which next-item interactions occur
- poses challenges. Effectively capturing query context is crucial for refining
ranking relevance and enhancing user engagement, as it provides valuable
signals about user intent within a session. Unlike an item's features, query
context is not temporally aligned with the item sequence, making its
incorporation into transformers challenging and error-prone. This paper
analyzes different strategies for incorporating query context into transformers
trained with a causal language modeling procedure as a case study. We propose a
new method that effectively fuses the item sequence with query context within
the attention mechanism. Through extensive offline and online experiments on a
large-scale online platform and open datasets, we present evidence that our
proposed method is an effective approach for integrating query context to
improve model ranking quality in terms of relevance and diversity.

Abstract: Modern recommender systems operate in uniquely dynamic settings: user
interests, item pools, and popularity trends shift continuously, and models
must adapt in real time without forgetting past preferences. While existing
tutorials on continual or lifelong learning cover broad machine learning
domains (e.g., vision and graphs), they do not address recommendation-specific
demands-such as balancing stability and plasticity per user, handling
cold-start items, and optimizing recommendation metrics under streaming
feedback. This tutorial aims to make a timely contribution by filling that gap.
We begin by reviewing the background and problem settings, followed by a
comprehensive overview of existing approaches. We then highlight recent efforts
to apply continual learning to practical deployment environments, such as
resource-constrained systems and sequential interaction settings. Finally, we
discuss open challenges and future research directions. We expect this tutorial
to benefit researchers and practitioners in recommender systems, data mining,
AI, and information retrieval across academia and industry.

Conclusion: HIPHOP通過整合語義學習和多層次意圖捕捉，有效改進了基於會話的推薦系統。

Abstract: Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will
likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous
session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,
ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some
methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and
irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on
item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their
ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable
LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP.
First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models
(LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item
embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item
transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing
module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we
design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user
intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively
exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an
intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.
Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive
learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available:

Result: FTRL算法在“最后通牒博弈”中实现了近似的最后迭代纳什均衡收敛，且在多轮博弈中同样有效。

Conclusion: 简单的学习算法可以产生复杂的经济行为，FTRL算法的收敛性适用范围比已知的更广。

Abstract: Bargaining games, where agents attempt to agree on how to split utility, are
an important class of games used to study economic behavior, which motivates a
study of online learning algorithms in these games. In this work, we tackle
when no-regret learning algorithms converge to Nash equilibria in bargaining
games. Recent results have shown that online algorithms related to Follow the
Regularized Leader (FTRL) converge to Nash equilibria (NE) in the last iterate
in a wide variety of games, including zero-sum games. However, bargaining games
do not have the properties used previously to established convergence
guarantees, even in the simplest case of the ultimatum game, which features a
single take-it-or-leave-it offer. Nonetheless, we establish that FTRL (without
the modifications necessary for zero-sum games) achieves last-iterate
convergence to an approximate NE in the ultimatum game along with a bound on
convergence time under mild assumptions. Further, we provide experimental
results to demonstrate that convergence to NE, including NE with asymmetric
payoffs, occurs under a broad range of initial conditions, both in the
ultimatum game and in bargaining games with multiple rounds. This work
demonstrates how complex economic behavior (e.g. learning to use threats and
the existence of many possible equilibrium outcomes) can result from using a
simple learning algorithm, and that FTRL can converge to equilibria in a more
diverse set of games than previously known.

Abstract: Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are pivotal for sustainable
hydrogen production, yet their long-term performance is hindered by membrane
degradation, which poses reliability and safety challenges. Therefore, accurate
modeling of this degradation is essential for optimizing durability and
performance. To address these concerns, traditional physics-based models have
been developed, offering interpretability but requiring numerous parameters
that are often difficult to measure and calibrate. Conversely, data-driven
approaches, such as machine learning, offer flexibility but may lack physical
consistency and generalizability. To address these limitations, this study
presents the first application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to
model membrane degradation in PEM electrolyzers. The proposed PINN framework
couples two ordinary differential equations, one modeling membrane thinning via
a first-order degradation law and another governing the time evolution of the
cell voltage under membrane degradation. Results demonstrate that the PINN
accurately captures the long-term system's degradation dynamics while
preserving physical interpretability with limited noisy data. Consequently,
this work introduces a novel hybrid modeling approach for estimating and
understanding membrane degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers, offering a
foundation for more robust predictive tools in electrochemical system
diagnostics.

Result: QCAI在解释性和预测准确性上均达到最新水平。

Conclusion: QCAI填补了现有解释性方法的空白，为免疫学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: CD8+ "killer" T cells and CD4+ "helper" T cells play a central role in the
adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major
Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs).
Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to
understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in
developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have
achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature
precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding
of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are
confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and
cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To
address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a
new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in
transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods;
we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally
determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using
these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid
residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method
and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the
dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.

Abstract: Stormwater infrastructures are decentralized urban water-management systems
that face highly unsteady hydraulic and pollutant loadings from episodic
rainfall-runoff events. Accurately evaluating their in-situ treatment
performance is essential for cost-effective design and planning. Traditional
lumped dynamic models (e.g., continuously stirred tank reactor, CSTR) are
computationally efficient but oversimplify transport and reaction processes,
limiting predictive accuracy and insight. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
resolves detailed turbulent transport and pollutant fate physics but incurs
prohibitive computational cost for unsteady and long-term simulations. To
address these limitations, this study develops a composite operator-based
neural network (CPNN) framework that leverages state-of-the-art operator
learning to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydraulics and
particulate matter (PM) in stormwater treatment. The framework is demonstrated
on a hydrodynamic separator (HS), a common urban treatment device. Results
indicate that the CPNN achieves R2 > 0.8 for hydraulic predictions in 95.2% of
test cases; for PM concentration predictions, R2 > 0.8 in 72.6% of cases and
0.4 < R2 < 0.8 in 22.6%. The analysis identifies challenges in capturing
dynamics under extreme low-flow conditions, owing to their lower contribution
to the training loss. Exploiting the automatic-differentiation capability of
the CPNN, sensitivity analyses quantify the influence of storm event loading on
PM transport. Finally, the potential of the CPNN framework for continuous,
long-term evaluation of stormwater infrastructure performance is discussed,
marking a step toward robust, climate-aware planning and implementation.

Conclusion: 机器学习框架中的PRNGs实现可能存在隐藏问题，影响统计质量和可重现性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) frameworks rely heavily on pseudorandom number
generators (PRNGs) for tasks such as data shuffling, weight initialization,
dropout, and optimization. Yet, the statistical quality and reproducibility of
these generators-particularly when integrated into frameworks like PyTorch,
TensorFlow, and NumPy-are underexplored. In this paper, we compare the
statistical quality of PRNGs used in ML frameworks (Mersenne Twister, PCG, and
Philox) against their original C implementations. Using the rigorous TestU01
BigCrush test suite, we evaluate 896 independent random streams for each
generator. Our findings challenge claims of statistical robustness, revealing
that even generators labeled ''crush-resistant'' (e.g., PCG, Philox) may fail
certain statistical tests. Surprisingly, we can observe some differences in
failure profiles between the native and framework-integrated versions of the
same algorithm, highlighting some implementation differences that may exist.

Result: 在小训练集下，模式成为固定点吸引子；在大训练集下，网络能够泛化，生成有意义的吸引子。

Conclusion: 伪似然不仅是一种高效推理工具，还能实现记忆和泛化的机制。

Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the
data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used
workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global
normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the
zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood
naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small,
patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those
of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on
uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured
datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics
(spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples
increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful
attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the
ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works
both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory
and generalization.

Abstract: Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of
Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This
study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization
framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five
use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code
generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how
prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases
demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use
case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed
notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a
substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the
router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and
of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was
explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,
using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.
Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt
optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning
and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by
task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt
optimization research.

Conclusion: FSL方法高效实用，强调数据质量优于数量，为间歇性故障检测提供了更好解决方案。

Abstract: One of the main challenges developers face in the use of continuous
integration (CI) and deployment pipelines is the occurrence of intermittent job
failures, which result from unexpected non-deterministic issues (e.g., flaky
tests or infrastructure problems) rather than regular code-related errors such
as bugs. Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large
datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or
regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on
non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job
failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not
an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In
fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1
open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\% of intermittent job
failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using
few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model
using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich
embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based
approach achieves 70-88\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,
outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\% F1-score) in 4
projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over
quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the
detection of intermittent job failures in organizations.

Result: LLM-assistants能够减少代码搜索时间、加速开发并自动化重复任务，但也可能导致认知卸载、协作减少和代码质量不稳定。大多数研究关注多维度生产力，但仅有少数涉及三个以上维度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了关键的研究空白，建议未来进行更全面的评估，尤其是纵向和团队层面的研究。

Abstract: Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to
transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these
tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and
design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how
LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we
present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published
between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis
reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical
risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated
development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,
studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team
collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of
studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two
SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer
productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial
room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency
are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and
Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and
methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.
This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future
research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly

including bug report analysis. ML aims to automate the understanding,
extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its
growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In
this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers,
selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive
use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like
BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular
for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop
word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising
after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software
projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug
localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on
specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation
metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold
cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust
statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to
provide useful insights for practitioners.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度学习（DL）模型（NGCM和DL	extit{ESy}M）与传统模型（HiRAM）在模拟极端事件（热浪和寒潮）上的表现，发现DL模型在未见过的气候条件下具有可比拟传统模型的能力，但在部分地区仍有不足。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: physics.ao-ph

Motivation: 深度学习模型作为快速模拟器，其能否模拟超出训练范围的极端事件尚不明确，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 比较了两种DL模型（NGCM和DL	extit{ESy}M）与传统模型HiRAM在1900-1960年间极端事件模拟中的表现，使用了观测的海表温度和海冰数据。

Result: DL模型在未见过的气候条件下表现良好，模拟能力与传统模型相当，但在北美和北亚部分地区表现不佳。其中DL	extit{ESy}M因温度自相关过度，倾向于高估事件频率。

Conclusion: DL模型在模拟极端事件上具有潜力，但物理-DL混合模型NGCM的表现更接近传统模型。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based general circulation models (GCMs) are emerging as
fast simulators, yet their ability to replicate extreme events outside their
training range remains unknown. Here, we evaluate two such models -- the hybrid
Neural General Circulation Model (NGCM) and purely data-driven Deep Learning
Earth System Model (DL\textit{ESy}M) -- against a conventional high-resolution
land-atmosphere model (HiRAM) in simulating land heatwaves and coldwaves. All
models are forced with observed sea surface temperatures and sea ice over
1900-2020, focusing on the out-of-sample early-20th-century period (1900-1960).
Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly
reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and cold wave events
during 1900-1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions
of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during
1940-1960. Due to excessive temperature autocorrelation, DL\textit{ESy}M tends
to overestimate heatwave and cold wave frequencies, whereas the physics-DL
hybrid NGCM exhibits persistence more similar to HiRAM.

<details>

Main category: physics.ao-ph

Motivation: 城市热岛效应在热浪期间加剧，对公共健康构成威胁。研究旨在通过分类驱动因素并开发高效模型，帮助城市规划者更准确地评估和缓解热岛效应。

Method: 采用随机森林（RFs）和极端梯度提升（XGB）算法，基于WRF-SLUCM模型输出数据，训练LUT区分模型，分类驱动因素为驱动（D）、城市（U）和局部（L）特征。

Result: LUT框架模型在预测T2和TSK时显著更准确，尤其表现在对小尺度驱动因素（如表面发射率、反照率和叶面积指数）的敏感性分析上。

Conclusion: 该方法为城市规划者提供了直接的可行性评估框架，但仍需进一步减少统计不确定性并在其他城市验证。

Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and
pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first
estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and
drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to
small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify
these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features,
respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency,
a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator
for Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to a Single-Layer Urban
Canopy Model (WRF-SLUCM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature
(T2). Using random forests (RFs) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained
on WRF-SLUCM output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in
2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize
features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical
weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and
sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers -
most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models
employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than
models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in
training. With RF-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method
substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce
statistical uncertainties and testing the method on other cities, the proposed
approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI
mitigation assessment.

Abstract: This article presents and validates an ideal, four-stage workflow for the
high-accuracy transcription and analysis of challenging medieval legal
documents. The process begins with a specialized Handwritten Text Recognition
(HTR) model, itself created using a novel "Clean Ground Truth" curation method
where a Large Language Model (LLM) refines the training data. This HTR model
provides a robust baseline transcription (Stage 1). In Stage 2, this baseline
is fed, along with the original document image, to an LLM for multimodal
post-correction, grounding the LLM's analysis and improving accuracy. The
corrected, abbreviated text is then expanded into full, scholarly Latin using a
prompt-guided LLM (Stage 3). A final LLM pass performs Named-Entity Correction
(NEC), regularizing proper nouns and generating plausible alternatives for
ambiguous readings (Stage 4). We validate this workflow through detailed case
studies, achieving Word Error Rates (WER) in the range of 2-7% against
scholarly ground truths. The results demonstrate that this hybrid, multi-stage
approach effectively automates the most laborious aspects of transcription
while producing a high-quality, analyzable output, representing a powerful and
practical solution for the current technological landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AR

Motivation: 现有矩阵ISA在执行GEMM时性能不佳，尤其是在处理小型、高瘦矩阵时，且缺乏动态适应能力。

Method: 提出MTE，通过少量额外指令和64位CSR实现指令集与微架构分离，支持跨维度向量化和利用现有向量寄存器。

Result: MTE在常见卷积和Transformer模型上表现出色，性能提升1.35倍。

Conclusion: MTE是一种灵活高效的矩阵ISA解决方案，为高性能计算和深度学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: GEneral Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) are recurrent in high-performance
computing and deep learning workloads. Typically, high-end CPUs accelerate GEMM
workloads with Single-Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) or vector Instruction
Set Architectures (ISAs). Since these ISAs face significant issues when running
GEMM workloads, particularly when dealing with small, tall, or skinny matrices,
matrix ISAs have been proposed and implemented by major hardware vendors in the
last years. Although these matrix ISAs deliver larger throughput when running
GEMMs than their SIMD/vector counterparts, they are rigid solutions unable to
dynamically adapt themselves to application-specific aspects like the data
format. This paper demonstrates that the state-of-the-art matrix ISAs deliver
suboptimal performance when running the most commonly used convolution and
transformer models.
  This paper proposes the Matrix Tile Extension (MTE), the first matrix ISA
that completely decouples the instruction set architecture from the
microarchitecture and seamlessly interacts with existing vector ISAs. MTE
incurs minimal implementation overhead since it only requires a few additional
instructions and a 64-bit Control Status Register (CSR) to keep its state.
Specifically, MTE can i) vectorize GEMMs across the three dimensions M, N, and
K; ii) leverage the capacity of the existing vector register file; and iii)
decouple the tile shape from the underlying microarchitecture. MTE achieves
speed-ups of 1.35x over the best state-of-the-art matrix ISA.

<details>

Main category: cs.AR

Motivation: 为满足CERN大型强子对撞机等场景中微秒级延迟要求，需要高效实现FPGA上的神经网络部署，其瓶颈是资源占用。

Method: 采用分布式算术（DA）优化CMVM操作，通过算法设计同时减少资源消耗和计算延迟。

Result: 资源占用减少达三分之一，同时降低延迟，使得此前不可行的网络得以实现。

Conclusion: 该算法高效且开源，已集成至hls4ml库，为实时神经网络推理提供了新可能。

Abstract: Neural networks with a latency requirement on the order of microseconds, like
the ones used at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, are typically deployed on
FPGAs fully unrolled and pipelined. A bottleneck for the deployment of such
neural networks is area utilization, which is directly related to the required
constant matrix-vector multiplication (CMVM) operations. In this work, we
propose an efficient algorithm for implementing CMVM operations with
distributed arithmetic (DA) on FPGAs that simultaneously optimizes for area
consumption and latency. The algorithm achieves resource reduction similar to
state-of-the-art algorithms while being significantly faster to compute. The
proposed algorithm is open-sourced and integrated into the \texttt{hls4ml}
library, a free and open-source library for running real-time neural network
inference on FPGAs. We show that the proposed algorithm can reduce on-chip
resources by up to a third for realistic, highly quantized neural networks
while simultaneously reducing latency, enabling the implementation of
previously infeasible networks.

Conclusion: 重新思考定性/定量的划分，并建议连接认知科学的实证研究。

Abstract: Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical
and arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and
quantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common
linguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural
language plus "grassroots mathematics".
  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and
cardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and
drowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a
small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning
about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide
normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical
notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we
discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones,
and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.
  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form
methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to
additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple
counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We
also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility
relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such
as the Pigeonhole Principle.
  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the
architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and
syntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of
logic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the
qualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical
findings in cognitive science.

<details>

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

Motivation: 工程应用中需要对湍流稳态统计量进行优化，但现有的计算方法由于湍流的混沌性，难以扩展到高自由度系统。

Method: 提出了一种在线梯度流（OGF）方法，通过在线估计梯度和参数更新，结合有限差分估计器，避免了梯度发散问题。

Result: OGF方法在多个混沌系统（Lorenz-63方程、Kuramoto–Sivashinsky方程和Navier–Stokes方程）中成功降低了损失函数，并准确恢复了最优参数。

Conclusion: OGF方法为优化混沌湍流的稳态统计提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution
converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest
typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t}
\int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow
\infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the
Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x;
\theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization,
flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as
existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically
representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the
chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method
diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large
degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state
statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method
forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while
simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key
feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster
optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to
avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is
demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial
differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky
equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous
isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the
loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately
recovers the optimal parameters.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 现有验证技术通常关注像素空间的Lp有界扰动，无法捕捉现实世界效应的低维结构，因此需要一种新方法来确保感知驱动控制系统在不确定性下的安全性。

Method: 引入了一种验证框架，通过显式建模几何扰动的不确定观察，构建从状态到图像的可边界映射，从而利用基于状态的验证工具。

Result: 提供了方法的理论保证，并在基准控制环境中展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为在现实视觉扰动下验证感知驱动控制系统的安全性提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 传统的人类指导形式（如演示或二元标量反馈）难以收集或信息量低，需要探索更高效的反馈形式。相对反馈在可用性和信息丰富性之间取得了平衡。

Method: 引入了一种新颖的方法，将相对反馈与离策略强化学习结合，通过稀疏奖励任务评估其效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提高强化学习的样本效率，并适应环境或用户偏好的变化。现实应用中成功学习了稀疏奖励设置下的导航策略。

Conclusion: 相对反馈与强化学习的结合在提高效率和适应性方面具有潜力，尤其在稀疏奖励任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Human guidance has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing reinforcement
learning (RL). However, conventional forms of guidance such as demonstrations
or binary scalar feedback can be challenging to collect or have low information
content, motivating the exploration of other forms of human input. Among these,
relative feedback (i.e., feedback on how to improve an action, such as "more to
the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为IMMP的新方法，用于解决在自主机器人驾驶中多源轨迹数据集迁移至目标域时的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 自主机器人驾驶中的运动规划是关键，但由于不同域间的代理交互和环境特征差异，现有方法（如域适应或集成学习）存在域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和计算成本高等问题。

Method: 提出Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP)，通过预合并和合并两步骤，利用不同域的参数检查点，高效提取并转移多样交互信息至目标域。

Result: 在各种规划基准和模型上的评估显示，IMMP的性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP能有效解决多源数据集迁移中的挑战，提高运动规划的效果。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解数据集设计（如特征选择和地理多样性）如何影响轨迹预测模型的性能，以优化自动驾驶的安全性。

Method: 通过使用自建的L4 Motion Forecasting数据集（德国和美国数据），与Argoverse 2基准数据集对比，评估特征选择和跨数据集迁移的效果。

Result: 研究发现，额外的地图和智能体特征并未显著提升模型性能，表明现代架构无需复杂特征集；跨数据集迁移和地理多样性对知识传递有显著影响。

Conclusion: 结论指出，公共数据集的有限特征已足够用于捕获复杂交互，同时跨文化和地理的数据集设计对模型泛化能力至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,
yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied.
This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset
transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in
multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4
Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the
US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to
the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset
experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred
between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will
be publicly available.

Conclusion: 上下文感知的动作空间设计对自动驾驶任务的强化学习具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.

Abstract: Circular genome visualizations are essential for exploring structural
variants and gene regulation. However, existing tools often require complex
scripting and manual configuration, making the process time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to learn. To address these challenges, we introduce
AuraGenome, an LLM-powered framework for rapid, reusable, and scalable
generation of multi-layered circular genome visualizations. AuraGenome combines
a semantic-driven multi-agent workflow with an interactive visual analytics
system. The workflow employs seven specialized LLM-driven agents, each assigned
distinct roles such as intent recognition, layout planning, and code
generation, to transform raw genomic data into tailored visualizations. The
system supports multiple coordinated views tailored for genomic data, offering
ring, radial, and chord-based layouts to represent multi-layered circular
genome visualizations. In addition to enabling interactions and configuration
reuse, the system supports real-time refinement and high-quality report export.
We validate its effectiveness through two case studies and a comprehensive user
study. AuraGenome is available at: https://github.com/Darius18/AuraGenome.

Abstract: We train a neural network to predict distributional responses in gene
expression following genetic perturbations. This is an essential task in
early-stage drug discovery, where such responses can offer insights into gene
function and inform target identification. Existing methods only predict
changes in the mean expression, overlooking stochasticity inherent in
single-cell data. In contrast, we offer a more realistic view of cellular
responses by modeling expression distributions. Our model predicts gene-level
histograms conditioned on perturbations and outperforms baselines in capturing
higher-order statistics, such as variance, skewness, and kurtosis, at a
fraction of the training cost. To generalize to unseen perturbations, we
incorporate prior knowledge via gene embeddings from large language models
(LLMs). While modeling a richer output space, the method remains competitive in
predicting mean expression changes. This work offers a practical step towards
more expressive and biologically informative models of perturbation effects.

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between accent strength and articulatory
features inferred from acoustic speech. To quantify accent strength, we compare
phonetic transcriptions with transcriptions based on dictionary-based
references, computing phoneme-level difference as a measure of accent strength.
The proposed framework leverages recent self-supervised learning articulatory
inversion techniques to estimate articulatory features. Analyzing a corpus of
read speech from American and British English speakers, this study examines
correlations between derived articulatory parameters and accent strength
proxies, associating systematic articulatory differences with indexed accent
strength. Results indicate that tongue positioning patterns distinguish the two
dialects, with notable differences inter-dialects in rhotic and low back
vowels. These findings contribute to automated accent analysis and articulatory
modeling for speech processing applications.

Abstract: Accurate audio quality estimation is essential for developing and evaluating
audio generation, retrieval, and enhancement systems. Existing non-intrusive

diverse perceptual factors and failing to generalize beyond speech. We propose
MMMOS, a no-reference, multi-domain audio quality assessment system that

ranks among the top three on 17 of 32 challenge metrics.

Abstract: This report presents our systems submitted to the audio-only and audio-visual
tracks of the DCASE2025 Task 3 Challenge: Stereo Sound Event Localization and
Detection (SELD) in Regular Video Content. SELD is a complex task that combines
temporal event classification with spatial localization, requiring reasoning
across spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. The last is arguably the
most challenging to model. Traditional SELD architectures rely on multichannel
input, which limits their ability to leverage large-scale pre-training due to
data constraints. To address this, we enhance standard SELD architectures with
semantic information by integrating pre-trained, contrastive language-aligned
models: CLAP for audio and OWL-ViT for visual inputs. These embeddings are
incorporated into a modified Conformer module tailored for multimodal fusion,
which we refer to as the Cross-Modal Conformer. Additionally, we incorporate
autocorrelation-based acoustic features to improve distance estimation. We
pre-train our models on curated synthetic audio and audio-visual datasets and
apply a left-right channel swapping augmentation to further increase the
training data. Both our audio-only and audio-visual systems substantially
outperform the challenge baselines on the development set, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our strategy. Performance is further improved through model
ensembling and a visual post-processing step based on human keypoints. Future
work will investigate the contribution of each modality and explore
architectural variants to further enhance results.

Motivation: 在资源受限的设备上部署语音增强系统时，通常需要在性能和计算效率之间做静态权衡。本文旨在通过动态剪枝技术，使系统能够根据输入自适应调整资源使用，从而在不增加存储成本的情况下实现更高效的运行。

Method: 通过在DEMUCS架构中引入动态剪枝技术，模型可以在不同的利用率因子（UF）下运行，每个UF对应不同的性能/效率权衡。此外，一个路由器子网与主干模型端到端训练，用于确定当前输入的最优UF，从而自适应地选择资源使用。

Conclusion: 动态剪枝技术在语音增强系统中具有显著优势，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提高计算效率。

Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) enables robust speech recognition, real-time
communication, hearing aids, and other applications where speech quality is
crucial. However, deploying such systems on resource-constrained devices
involves choosing a static trade-off between performance and computational
efficiency. In this paper, we introduce dynamic slimming to DEMUCS, a popular
SE architecture, making it scalable and input-adaptive. Slimming lets the model
operate at different utilization factors (UF), each corresponding to a
different performance/efficiency trade-off, effectively mimicking multiple
model sizes without the extra storage costs. In addition, a router subnet,
trained end-to-end with the backbone, determines the optimal UF for the current
input. Thus, the system saves resources by adaptively selecting smaller UFs
when additional complexity is unnecessary. We show that our solution is
Pareto-optimal against individual UFs, confirming the benefits of dynamic
routing. When training the proposed dynamically-slimmable model to use 10% of
its capacity on average, we obtain the same or better speech quality as the
equivalent static 25% utilization while reducing MACs by 29%.

### [545] [Reconstructing Biological Pathways by Applying Selective Incremental Learning to (Very) Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04432)

Key words: 生成式AI, 生物医学研究, 语言模型, BERT, 分子调控关系

TL;DR: 研究提出在生物医学领域使用小型、任务特定的语言模型（LM）来避免大型语言模型（LLM）产生的“幻觉”问题，并通过实验证明小型BERT模型在预测分子调控关系上的高准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: q-bio.MN

Motivation: 通用大型语言模型（LLM）在医学和生物医学领域因“幻觉”（不准确的创造性回答）问题受限，亟需更适合该领域的小型任务特定模型。

Method: 采用小型BERT模型（约1.1亿参数），通过主动学习策略筛选信息量高的样本，预测结核病相关分子调控关系。利用信息熵逐步优化样本选择。

Result: 小型模型在仅使用25%的数据量下，预测分子调控关系的准确率超过80%。高确定性错误样本对提升准确性贡献显著，而低确定性正确样本效果不佳。

Conclusion: 小型任务特定LM在生物医学研究中表现优异，信息熵驱动的样本选择策略可有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming
ubiquitous in many fields. Though progress continues to be made, general
purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative
answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in
the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that
the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a
more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In
this work we apply a very small LM by today's standards to the specialized task
of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps
in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt
to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually
curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative
examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a
small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular
interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over
80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in
question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of
new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring
the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty
(lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain
examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning
rate.

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years has also given rise
to the development of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). These new MLLMs allow us to
process images, videos and even audio alongside textual inputs. In this
project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of MLLMs in analysing sports
videos, focusing mainly on tennis videos. Despite research done on tennis
analysis, there remains a gap in models that are able to understand and
identify the sequence of events in a tennis rally, which would be useful in
other fields of sports analytics. As such, we will mainly assess the MLLMs on
their ability to fill this gap - to classify tennis actions, as well as their
ability to identify these actions in a sequence of tennis actions in a rally.
We further looked into ways we can improve the MLLMs' performance, including
different training methods and even using them together with other traditional
models.

Abstract: We present the Object-Based Sub-Environment Recognition (OBSER) framework, a
novel Bayesian framework that infers three fundamental relationships between
sub-environments and their constituent objects. In the OBSER framework, metric
and self-supervised learning models estimate the object distributions of
sub-environments on the latent space to compute these measures. Both
theoretically and empirically, we validate the proposed framework by
introducing the ($\epsilon,\delta$) statistically separable (EDS) function
which indicates the alignment of the representation. Our framework reliably
performs inference in open-world and photorealistic environments and
outperforms scene-based methods in chained retrieval tasks. The OBSER framework
enables zero-shot recognition of environments to achieve autonomous environment

Motivation: 解决AI生成游戏视觉资产与游戏叙事一致性的问题，以及训练数据分布不均导致的视觉多样性限制。

Method: 从OpenGameArt.org收集艺术家创作的图块，并提供语义标注，引入对象检测流程，标注语义、连通性和对象分类。

Result: GameTileNet成为改进程序化内容生成方法、支持叙事丰富游戏内容的宝贵资源，并为低分辨率非真实图像建立基准。

Conclusion: GameTileNet通过视觉-语言对齐和语义标注，推动了叙事驱动的AI生成游戏内容的研究。

Abstract: GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for
low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG)
and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to
create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However,
generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to
inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The
diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is
also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for
training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game
tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing
semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The
dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based
game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object
classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods,
supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object
detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images.
  TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles
designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through
visual-language alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中因时间感知效率低而表现不佳，需要通过动态调整时间焦点来优化。

Method: Temporal Search框架包含两个迭代阶段：提出可能包含相关信息的时间区间，并从区间中固定采样帧数以生成更精确的响应和置信度得分。

Result: TS框架显著提升了模型对长视频的理解能力，并通过TS-BFS进一步优化了搜索效率。

Conclusion: Temporal Search是一种高效且无需训练的方法，能够显著增强多模态大语言模型对长视频的理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
video understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form
videos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike
humans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate
query-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling
across the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of
missing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal
Search, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal
regions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key
observation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal
intervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through
two main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is
likely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of
frames from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model
to produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the
model by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal
intervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,
keyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval
perception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce
TS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a
candidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and
uniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,
and the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive
real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the
safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to
uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this
work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk
prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing
high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based
motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,
other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize
plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call
DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation
framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel
information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and
trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial
relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our
DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction
performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy
soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation
on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a
significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to
68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 生成的对抗样本既多样化又保持原始概念，攻击效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架在理论和实验上均优于传统方法，展现了概念对抗攻击的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a concept-based adversarial attack framework that extends beyond
single-image perturbations by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Rather than
modifying a single image, our method operates on an entire concept --
represented by a probabilistic generative model or a set of images -- to
generate diverse adversarial examples. Preserving the concept is essential, as
it ensures that the resulting adversarial images remain identifiable as
instances of the original underlying category or identity. By sampling from
this concept-based adversarial distribution, we generate images that maintain
the original concept but vary in pose, viewpoint, or background, thereby
misleading the classifier. Mathematically, this framework remains consistent
with traditional adversarial attacks in a principled manner. Our theoretical
and empirical results demonstrate that concept-based adversarial attacks yield
more diverse adversarial examples and effectively preserve the underlying
concept, while achieving higher attack efficiency.

comparative analysis of two most robust versions of YOLOv8 and Yolov11 and
their three variants tailored for image segmentation tasks in complex and
low-visibility subsea environments. Using pipeline inspection datasets captured
beneath the seabed, it evaluates model performance in accurately delineating

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces a fundamental tension between deep, fine-grained
fusion and computational scalability. While cross-attention models achieve
strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic
complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this
challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures
the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent
pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving
multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion
block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric
cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming
modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit
(GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow,
enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful,
recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it
ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark
demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex
baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF
creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive
fusion mechanism. Our work presents a robust and efficient paradigm for
powerful, scalable multimodal representation learning.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解VLMs中的幻觉行为提供了新视角，并强调了将心理学原理纳入模型评估的重要性。

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated
in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes
hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter
means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user
expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or
externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that
hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human
psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing
VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency,
and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically
analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals
psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark,
we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size
influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated
questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit
stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting
increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human
subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural
differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new
perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the
importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.The
benchmark is available at https://github.com/lxrswdd/AIpsych.

Result: 在跨领域任务中，模型性能显著提升（Dice分数提高6.2，Hausdorff距离减少15.8mm），且参数效率高。

Conclusion: Causal-SAM-LLM为构建鲁棒、高效且可控的医学AI系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation
is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains.
This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations
between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this
fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that
elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our
framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,
incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial
Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual
descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's
features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns
a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time
Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM
interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation
decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct
an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public
datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under
cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM
establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness,
improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff
Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9%
of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for
building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based image generators has made it
increasingly difficult to distinguish generated from real images. This can
erode trust in digital media, making it critical to develop generalizable
detectors for generated images. Recent methods leverage diffusion denoising
cues, but mainly focus on single-step reconstruction errors, ignoring the
inherent sequential nature of the denoising process. In this work, we propose
LATTE - Latent Trajectory Embedding - a novel approach that models the
evolution of latent embeddings across several denoising timesteps. By modeling
the trajectory of such embeddings rather than single-step errors, LATTE
captures subtle, discriminative patterns that distinguish real from generated
images. Each latent is refined by employing our latent-visual feature
refinement module and aggregated into a unified representation. Afterwards, it
is fused with the visual features and finally passed into a lightweight
classifier. Our experiments demonstrate that LATTE surpasses the baselines on
several established benchmarks, such as GenImage and DiffusionFake. Moreover,
it demonstrates strong performance in cross-generator and cross-datasets
settings, highlighting the potential of using the trajectory of latent
embeddings for generated image detection. The code is available on the

Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) in medical imaging aims to support clinical
diagnosis by automatically interpreting complex imaging data in response to
natural language queries. Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual
and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and
clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.
Specifically, in computed tomography (CT), such approaches are similar to the
conventional practices in medical image analysis. However, these approaches pay
less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the
volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this
paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced
by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional
multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph
integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and
question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive
graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this
structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt
to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive
experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust
reasoning capabilities.

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和检索增强生成技术，解析墓碑图像和文本信息，生成结构化表示。

Result: 与传统OCR方法相比，解析准确率从F1分数36.1提升至89.5，且在多样文化和语言条件下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究首次采用大规模视觉语言模型规范墓碑理解，为文化遗产保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating
individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic
expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation
challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation,
and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework
for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization
and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning
Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further
enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes,
and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our
method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We
additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and
cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion
to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents
the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large
vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

Abstract: Sudden Death Syndrome (SDS), caused by Fusarium virguliforme, poses a
significant threat to soybean production. This study presents an AI-driven web
application for early detection of SDS on soybean leaves using hyperspectral
imaging, enabling diagnosis prior to visible symptom onset. Leaf samples from
healthy and inoculated plants were scanned using a portable hyperspectral
imaging system (398-1011 nm), and a Genetic Algorithm was employed to select
five informative wavelengths (505.4, 563.7, 712.2, 812.9, and 908.4 nm)
critical for discriminating infection status. These selected bands were fed
into a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract
spatial-spectral features, which were subsequently classified using ten
classical machine learning models. Ensemble classifiers (Random Forest,
AdaBoost), Linear SVM, and Neural Net achieved the highest accuracy (>98%) and
minimal error across all folds, as confirmed by confusion matrices and
cross-validation metrics. Poor performance by Gaussian Process and QDA
highlighted their unsuitability for this dataset. The trained models were
deployed within a web application that enables users to upload hyperspectral
leaf images, visualize spectral profiles, and receive real-time classification
results. This system supports rapid and accessible plant disease diagnostics,
contributing to precision agriculture practices. Future work will expand the
training dataset to encompass diverse genotypes, field conditions, and disease
stages, and will extend the system for multiclass disease classification and
broader crop applicability.

Conclusion: VLM2Vec-V2为多模态嵌入学习提供了可扩展的解决方案，适用于研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream
tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over
different modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,
E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for
other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their
applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search
and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this
gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across
diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark
that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video
retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question
answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we
train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,
video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2
achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document
retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image
benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the
generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights
effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for
more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and
real-world settings.

Motivation: 当前视频数据集中的长段落描述稀缺，原因在于人工标注成本高且语言生成过程复杂。现有方法难以解释视觉与语言之间的关系。

Method: 提出一种基于时空事件图的共享表示方法，通过分析性方法连接多个视觉任务，自动生成解释性强的视频描述，并用于自监督训练神经网络。

Conclusion: 论文提出的解释性神经分析方法能够有效解决视频长段落描述的生成问题，并为自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The task of describing video content in natural language is commonly referred
to as video captioning. Unlike conventional video captions, which are typically
brief and widely available, long-form paragraph descriptions in natural
language are scarce. This limitation of current datasets is due to the
expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task
of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the
underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and
time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available
datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the
problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of
descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while
state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating
shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos
and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and
language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared
representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space
and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to
integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural
language description. Moreover, we also demonstrate how our automated and
explainable video description generation process can function as a fully
automatic teacher to effectively train direct, end-to-end neural student
pathways, within a self-supervised neuro-analytical system. We validate that
our explainable neuro-analytical approach generates coherent, rich and relevant
textual descriptions on videos collected from multiple varied datasets, using
both standard evaluation metrics, human annotations and consensus from
ensembles of state-of-the-art VLMs.

Key words: 多模态大语言模型, 幻觉问题, 闭环训练, 一致性反馈, ReLoop

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ReLoop的统一闭环训练框架，通过多模态一致性机制减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在开放式视觉问答中表现优秀，但存在幻觉问题，即输出与输入语义不符。现有方法缺乏内在验证机制，因此需要一种直接在训练中验证输出的方法。

Method: 提出ReLoop框架，采用环形结构，集成三种一致性反馈机制（语义重建、视觉描述和注意力监督），强迫模型在训练中自我修正输出。

Result: 实验表明，ReLoop能有效降低多个基准测试中的幻觉率。

Conclusion: ReLoop为MLLMs中的幻觉问题提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to
hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input
semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual
consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc
correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during
training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training
framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding
in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three
complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice
and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency
Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,
and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components
collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and
interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during
training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of
ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing
a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our
source code and data in the camera-ready version.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种认知启发的方法，通过重新定义扩散模型中的“幻觉”为潜在对齐空间中的轨迹漂移，并引入了动态向量表示的Alignment Risk Code (ARC)来量化生成过程中的对齐问题。基于此，提出TensionModulator (TM-ARC)控制器以减少幻觉。

<details>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 尽管文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型在图像质量和提示保真度上取得了显著进展，但模型仍存在“幻觉”问题，即生成内容与提示语义的偏差。本文旨在从认知角度理解并解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Hallucination Tri-Space概念和Alignment Risk Code (ARC)，用于量化生成过程中的对齐问题，并开发轻量级控制器TensionModulator (TM-ARC)以实时干预采样过程。

Result: 实验表明，TM-ARC能显著减少幻觉，同时不影响图像质量或多样性。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和缓解T2I扩散模型中的生成失败提供了统一且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity,
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent
"hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from
the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts,
we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within
the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired
perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a
latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds
within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously
negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence,
structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this
three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the
Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies
real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures
overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and
its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop
the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely
in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted,
axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments
on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework
offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating
generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Conclusion: 通过answerability对齐框架可显著提升Video-LLMs的实用性和准确性。

Abstract: In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models
have achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language
Models as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A
prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the
video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly
trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in
real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the
informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to
assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the
best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due
to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to
identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose
alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the
ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and
appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the
video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics
designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we
present a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment
for answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs通过增加视觉编码器来捕捉多样化的视觉信息，但这种做法可能导致性能下降或收益递减，即编码器冗余问题。

Method: 通过全面的消融实验分析多编码器MLLMs，提出条件利用率(CUR)和信息差距(IG)来量化每个编码器的独特贡献和整体效用差异。

Result: 实验表明某些视觉编码器对性能的贡献很小甚至为负，证实了冗余现象的普遍存在。

Conclusion: 提出CUR和IG作为有效的诊断工具，为设计更高效的多模态架构提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly adopt multiple vision
encoders to capture diverse visual information, ranging from coarse semantics
to fine grained details. While this approach is intended to enhance visual
understanding capability, we observe that the performance gains from adding
encoders often diminish and can even lead to performance degradation, a
phenomenon we term encoder redundancy. This paper presents a systematic
investigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state
of the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant
redundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a
principled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we
introduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder
utility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming
substantial redundancy. Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders
contribute minimally, or even negatively, to the model's performance,
confirming the prevalence of redundancy. These findings highlight critical
inefficiencies in current multi encoder designs and establish that our proposed
metrics can serve as valuable diagnostic tools for developing more efficient
and effective multimodal architectures.

Motivation: 生物医学数据集样本不平衡且隐私限制严格，阻碍了高质量机器学习模型的开发。

Method: 利用基于LoRA权重的稳定扩散模型生成合成图像，并结合少量真实样本训练分类器。

Result: ResNet分类器准确率从27.3%提升至78.4%；CLIP分类器从61.8%提升至76.8%。

Conclusion: 合成图像可有效克服数据限制，提升模型泛化能力，支持医学诊断与研究。

Abstract: Biomedical datasets often contain a large sample imbalance and are subject to
strict privacy constraints, which together hinder the development of accurate
machine learning models. One potential solution is to generate synthetic
images, as this can improve data availability while preserving patient privacy.
However, it remains difficult to generate synthetic images of sufficient
quality for training robust classifiers. In this work, we focus on the
classification of single white blood cells, a key component in the diagnosis of
hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a severe blood
cancer. We demonstrate how synthetic images generated with a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model using LoRA weights when guided by real few-shot samples of the
target white blood cell classes, can enhance classifier performance for limited
data. When training a ResNet classifier, accuracy increased from 27.3\% to
78.4\% (+51.1\%) by adding 5000 synthetic images per class to a small and
highly imbalanced real dataset. For a CLIP-based classifier, the accuracy
improved from 61.8\% to 76.8\% (+15.0\%). The synthetic images are highly
similar to real images, and they can help overcome dataset limitations,
enhancing model generalization. Our results establish synthetic images as a
tool in biomedical research, improving machine learning models, and
facilitating medical diagnosis and research.

Motivation: 历史文档因多种损伤而严重退化，现有方法无法满足实际需求，亟需一种更高效的自动化修复方案。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：OCR辅助损伤定位、视觉-语言上下文文本预测和块自回归外观修复，支持人机协作。

Result: AutoHDR将OCR准确率从46.83%提升至84.05%，人机协作后进一步提高到94.25%。

Conclusion: AutoHDR在历史文档修复中表现卓越，为文化遗产保护提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have
undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and
oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily
focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical
needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel
automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and
6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well
as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians'
restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage
localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive
appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless
human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and
optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's
remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our
method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83\% to 84.05\%, with further enhancement
to 94.25\% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents
a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and
contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and
dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.

Conclusion: SemiOVS有效利用OOD未标记图像，为半监督语义分割任务提供新思路，推动实际应用。

Abstract: In semi-supervised semantic segmentation, existing studies have shown
promising results in academic settings with controlled splits of benchmark
datasets. However, the potential benefits of leveraging significantly larger
sets of unlabeled images remain unexplored. In real-world scenarios, abundant
unlabeled images are often available from online sources (web-scraped images)
or large-scale datasets. However, these images may have different distributions
from those of the target dataset, a situation known as out-of-distribution
(OOD). Using these images as unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning can
lead to inaccurate pseudo-labels, potentially misguiding network training. In
this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework
with an open-vocabulary segmentation model (SemiOVS) to effectively utilize
unlabeled OOD images. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and Context datasets
demonstrate two key findings: (1) using additional unlabeled images improves
the performance of semi-supervised learners in scenarios with few labels, and
(2) using the open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) model to pseudo-label OOD
images leads to substantial performance gains. In particular, SemiOVS
outperforms existing PrevMatch and SemiVL methods by +3.5 and +3.0 mIoU,
respectively, on Pascal VOC with a 92-label setting, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. These findings demonstrate that our approach effectively utilizes

Key words: 生成AI、作者写作风格、文本到图像、扩散模型、跨模态理解

TL;DR: 利用作者写作表（AWS）和LLM生成文本到图像提示，通过扩散模型为49种作者风格生成视觉表示，人类评估显示风格匹配度较高，但抽象叙事元素的视觉化仍有挑战。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 将文本定义的作者写作风格转化为视觉表示是生成AI中的新挑战，研究旨在开发一种端到端方法以实现个性化的视觉风格生成。

Method: 使用AWS作为输入，LLM生成三个文本提示，扩散模型渲染图像，通过人类评估衡量风格匹配和视觉独特性。

Result: 生成图像与作者风格的匹配度较高（平均4.08/5），视觉独特性适中，能够捕捉氛围，但抽象元素的视觉化存在困难。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的端到端方法，为视觉风格个性化提供了初步实证支持，并拓展了创造性辅助和跨模态理解的潜在应用。

Abstract: Translating nuanced, textually-defined authorial writing styles into
compelling visual representations presents a novel challenge in generative AI.
This paper introduces a pipeline that leverages Author Writing Sheets (AWS) -
structured summaries of an author's literary characteristics - as input to a
Large Language Model (LLM, Claude 3.7 Sonnet). The LLM interprets the AWS to
generate three distinct, descriptive text-to-image prompts, which are then
rendered by a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium). We evaluated our
approach using 49 author styles from Reddit data, with human evaluators
assessing the stylistic match and visual distinctiveness of the generated
images. Results indicate a good perceived alignment between the generated
visuals and the textual authorial profiles (mean style match: $4.08/5$), with
images rated as moderately distinctive. Qualitative analysis further
highlighted the pipeline's ability to capture mood and atmosphere, while also
identifying challenges in representing highly abstract narrative elements. This
work contributes a novel end-to-end methodology for visual authorial style
personalization and provides an initial empirical validation, opening avenues
for applications in creative assistance and cross-modal understanding.

Motivation: 探索如何将大型语言模型的推理能力通过强化学习迁移到多模态模型中，以解锁更高级的视觉推理能力。

Method: 采用两阶段范式：1）基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的大规模语言冷启动微调；2）近1000步的多模态强化学习（RL），规模超越之前所有开源工作。

Result: 模型Open-Vision-Reasoner（OVR）在MATH500（95.3%）、MathVision（51.8%）和MathVerse（54.6%）等基准测试中达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 冷启动阶段通过语言心理意象实现早期行为转移，强化学习关键性地识别并扩展有效模式，模型战略性地偏好高效用行为（如视觉反射）。

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems
from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable
rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage
paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning,
followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps,
surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work
reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly
early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly
memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up
effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors
such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR),
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks,
including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We
release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of
more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

<details>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现实场景中，隐私问题限制了敏感数据的访问，SFUDA可以无需目标域标注数据实现领域适应，但原型样本质量低和伪标签错误分配仍是主要挑战。

Method: 方法包括三个阶段：1）可靠样本记忆模块（RSM）提升原型质量；2）多视图对比学习（MVCL）增强伪标签；3）噪声标签过滤进一步优化伪标签。

Result: 在VisDA 2017、Office-Home和Office-31数据集上，分类准确率分别比次优方法和13种现有方法平均提升约2%和6%。

Conclusion: 提出的三阶段方法有效解决了SFUDA中的关键问题，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Domain adaptation has become a widely adopted approach in machine learning
due to the high costs associated with labeling data. It is typically applied
when access to a labeled source domain is available. However, in real-world
scenarios, privacy concerns often restrict access to sensitive information,
such as fingerprints, bank account details, and facial images. A promising
solution to this issue is Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA),
which enables domain adaptation without requiring access to labeled target
domain data. Recent research demonstrates that SFUDA can effectively address
domain discrepancies; however, two key challenges remain: (1) the low quality
of prototype samples, and (2) the incorrect assignment of pseudo-labels. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a method consisting of three main phases.
In the first phase, we introduce a Reliable Sample Memory (RSM) module to
improve the quality of prototypes by selecting more representative samples. In
the second phase, we employ a Multi-View Contrastive Learning (MVCL) approach
to enhance pseudo-label quality by leveraging multiple data augmentations. In
the final phase, we apply a noisy label filtering technique to further refine
the pseudo-labels. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets - VisDA 2017,
Office-Home, and Office-31 - demonstrate that our method achieves approximately
2 percent and 6 percent improvements in classification accuracy over the
second-best method and the average of 13 well-known state-of-the-art
approaches, respectively.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets,
dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets
that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The
integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field.
However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset
with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be
critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the
downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy
for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty
to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is
sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by
matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic
transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for
distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance
on other downstream tasks.

Result: SafeVision在多样场景下能有效检测面部交换的深度伪造内容，并提供隐私保护。

Conclusion: SafeVision是一种可靠且可扩展的深度伪造检测解决方案，尤其适用于现实世界中的复杂应用。

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes involving face-swaps presents a significant challenge,
particularly in real-world scenarios where anyone can perform face-swapping
with freely available tools and apps without any technical knowledge. Existing
deepfake detection methods rely on facial landmarks or inconsistencies in
pixel-level features and often struggle with face-swap deepfakes, where the
source face is seamlessly blended into the target image or video. The
prevalence of face-swap is evident in everyday life, where it is used to spread
false information, damage reputations, manipulate political opinions, create
non-consensual intimate deepfakes (NCID), and exploit children by enabling the
creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Even prominent public figures
are not immune to its impact, with numerous deepfakes of them circulating
widely across social media platforms. Another challenge faced by deepfake
detection methods is the creation of datasets that encompass a wide range of
variations, as training models require substantial amounts of data. This raises
privacy concerns, particularly regarding the processing and storage of personal
facial data, which could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. Our key idea is
to identify these style discrepancies to detect face-swapped images effectively
without accessing the real facial image. We perform comprehensive evaluations
using multiple datasets and face-swapping methods, which showcases the
effectiveness of SafeVision in detecting face-swap deepfakes across diverse
scenarios. SafeVision offers a reliable and scalable solution for detecting
face-swaps in a privacy preserving manner, making it particularly effective in
challenging real-world applications. To the best of our knowledge, SafeVision
is the first deepfake detection using style features while providing inherent
privacy protection.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有连续手语识别方法难以处理多样性样本，且在时间和上下文建模上表现不足。

Method: 提出动态上下文感知卷积（DCAC）和子网正则化CTC（SR-CTC），以优化模型泛化能力和防止过拟合。

Result: 在主流数据集上实现了最先进性能。

Conclusion: DESign有效提升了手语识别的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods struggle with
handling diverse samples. Although dynamic convolutions are ideal for this
task, they mainly focus on spatial modeling and fail to capture the temporal
dynamics and contextual dependencies. To address this, we propose DESign, a
novel framework that incorporates Dynamic Context-Aware Convolution (DCAC) and
Subnet Regularization Connectionist Temporal Classification (SR-CTC). DCAC
dynamically captures the inter-frame motion cues that constitute signs and
uniquely adapts convolutional weights in a fine-grained manner based on
contextual information, enabling the model to better generalize across diverse
signing behaviors and boost recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that
existing methods still rely on only a limited number of frames for parameter
updates during training, indicating that CTC learning overfits to a dominant
path. To address this, SR-CTC regularizes training by applying supervision to
subnetworks, encouraging the model to explore diverse CTC alignment paths and
effectively preventing overfitting. A classifier-sharing strategy in SR-CTC
further strengthens multi-scale consistency. Notably, SR-CTC introduces no
inference overhead and can be seamlessly integrated into existing CSLR models
to boost performance. Extensive ablations and visualizations further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Results on mainstream CSLR datasets
(i.e., PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily) demonstrate that DESign achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 结论强调了基础设计选择的重要性，指出优化核心组件与架构创新同样关键，为未来方法提供了指导方向。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection aims to localize semantic changes between
images of the same location captured at different times. In the past few years,
newer methods have attributed enhanced performance to the additions of new and
complex components to existing architectures. Most fail to measure the
performance contribution of fundamental design choices such as backbone
selection, pre-training strategies, and training configurations. We claim that
such fundamental design choices often improve performance even more
significantly than the addition of new architectural components. Due to that,
we systematically revisit the design space of change detection models and
analyse the full potential of a well-optimised baseline. We identify a set of
fundamental design choices that benefit both new and existing architectures.
Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that when carefully designed, even an
architecturally simple model can match or surpass state-of-the-art performance
on six challenging change detection datasets. Our best practices generalise
beyond our architecture and also offer performance improvements when applied to
related methods, indicating that the space of fundamental design choices has
been underexplored. Our guidelines and architecture provide a strong foundation
for future methods, emphasizing that optimizing core components is just as
important as architectural novelty in advancing change detection performance.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了受控基准与开放世界需求之间的空白，为未来时尚图像编辑奠定了基础。

Abstract: To advance real-world fashion image editing, we analyze existing two-stage
pipelines(mask generation followed by diffusion-based editing)which overly
prioritize generator optimization while neglecting mask controllability. This
results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility
(coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper
torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length
customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to
articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain
limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star,
a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest,
etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In
Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal
keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress
noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics
(Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and
sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and
Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world
demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the
foundation for industrial fashion image editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型（VLM）在跨模态语义对齐中表现出色，但传统提示工程依赖粗粒度类别标签，忽视了细粒度局部语义。现有方法假设VLM能识别局部视觉细节，但实验表明CLIP偏向全局图像模式，难以处理局部描述符。

Method: 提出一种简单、即插即用的方法，通过随机多裁剪增强激活CLIP的局部特征分析能力。裁剪部分区域以限制模型感受野并重新校准其注意力机制，从而减少全局偏向。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和测试时适应设置下的实验表明，该方法（D&D）显著提升了CLIP的性能。

Conclusion: 通过裁剪部分区域激活局部特征分析能力，能够有效弥补CLIP的固有局限，使其在细粒度任务中表现更优。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic
alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot
generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies
on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics.
Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual
details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with
attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our
systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward
global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual
descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple,
effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the
Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop
augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis.
By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the
model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby
mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot,
few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive video-based analytics framework for tennis doubles
that addresses the lack of automated analysis tools for this strategically

unique requirements of tennis video labelling. The framework integrates
advanced machine learning techniques including GroundingDINO for precise player
localisation through natural language grounding and YOLO-Pose for robust pose

whilst improving data consistency and quality. We evaluate our approach on
doubles tennis match data and demonstrate that CNN-based models with transfer
learning substantially outperform pose-based methods for predicting shot types,
player positioning, and formations. The CNN models effectively capture complex

integrated system bridges advanced analytical capabilities with the strategic
complexities of tennis doubles, providing a foundation for automated tactical

Conclusion: 跨模态注意力和特征增强对模型鲁棒性和性能提升贡献显著。

Abstract: Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the following question: How do generic foundation
models (e.g., CLIP, BLIP, LLaVa, DINO) compare against a domain-specific face
recognition model (viz., AdaFace or ArcFace) on the face recognition task?
Through a series of experiments involving several foundation models and
benchmark datasets, we are able to report the following findings: (a) In all
datasets considered, domain-specific models outperformed zero-shot foundation
models. (b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on
over-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the
importance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of
0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on
the LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the
TMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%. (c) A simple
score-level fusion of a foundation model with a domain-specific FR model
improved the accuracy at low FMRs. For example, the TMR of AdaFace when fused
with BLIP improved from 72.64% to 83.31% at an FMR of 0.0001% on the IJB-B
dataset and from 73.17% to 85.81% on the IJB-C dataset. (d) Foundation models,
such as ChatGPT, can be used to impart explainability to the FR pipeline (e.g.,
``Despite minor lighting and head tilt differences, the two left-profile images
show high consistency in forehead slope, nose shape, chin contour...''). In
some instances, foundation models are even able to resolve low-confidence
decisions made by AdaFace (e.g., ``Although AdaFace assigns a low similarity
score of 0.21, both images exhibit visual similarity...and the pair is likely
of the same person''), thereby reiterating the importance of combining
domain-specific FR models with generic foundation models in a judicious manner.

Abstract: Brain stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and long-term
disability worldwide, highlighting the need for precise and fast prediction
techniques. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is considered one of the most
effective methods for diagnosing brain strokes. The majority of stroke
classification techniques rely on a single slice-level prediction mechanism,
allowing the radiologist to manually choose the most critical CT slice from the
original CT volume. Although clinical evaluations are often used in traditional
diagnostic procedures, machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for
improving stroke diagnosis. To supplement traditional diagnostic techniques,
this study investigates the use of machine learning models, specifically
concerning the prediction of brain stroke at an early stage utilizing CT scan
images. In this research, we proposed a novel approach to brain stroke
detection leveraging machine learning techniques, focusing on optimizing
classification performance with pre-trained deep learning models and advanced
optimization strategies. Pre-trained models, including DenseNet201,
InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception, are utilized for feature
extraction. Additionally, we employed feature engineering techniques, including
BFO, PCA, and LDA, to enhance models' performance further. These features are
subsequently classified using machine learning algorithms such as SVC, RF, XGB,
DT, LR, KNN, and GNB. Our experiments demonstrate that the combination of
MobileNetV2, LDA, and SVC achieved the highest classification accuracy of
97.93%, significantly outperforming other model-optimizer-classifier
combinations. The results underline the effectiveness of integrating
lightweight pre-trained models with robust optimization and classification
techniques for brain stroke diagnosis.

Motivation: 探索视频基础模型（ViFMs）作为通用方法在跨学科任务中的潜力，并评估其是否能在科学领域中替代领域专用模型。

Method: 构建SciVid基准测试，涵盖医学、动物行为和天气预报等五个科学视频任务，通过简单适配模块对六种ViFMs进行评估。

Result: 结果表明，ViFMs在多个应用中通过通用表征能达到先进水平，但同时也暴露了现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: SciVid展示了ViFMs在科学应用中的潜力，并指出了未来开发更具通用性模型的机会。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a proliferation of spatiotemporal foundation
models in different scientific disciplines. While promising, these models are
often domain-specific and are only assessed within the particular applications
for which they are designed. Given that many tasks can be represented as video
modeling problems, video foundation models (ViFMs) hold considerable promise as
general-purpose domain-agnostic approaches. However, it is not known whether
the knowledge acquired on large-scale but potentially out-of-domain data can be
effectively transferred across diverse scientific disciplines, and if a single,
pretrained ViFM can be competitive with domain-specific baselines. To address
this, we introduce SciVid, a comprehensive benchmark comprising five
*Sci*entific *Vid*eo tasks, across medical computer vision, animal behavior,
and weather forecasting. We adapt six leading ViFMs to SciVid using simple
trainable readout modules, establishing strong baselines and demonstrating the
potential for effective transfer learning. Specifically, we show that
state-of-the-art results can be obtained in several applications by leveraging
the general-purpose representations from ViFM backbones. Furthermore, our
results reveal the limitations of existing ViFMs, and highlight opportunities
for the development of generalizable models for high-impact scientific
applications. We release our code at https://github.com/google-deepmind/scivid
to facilitate further research in the development of ViFMs.

Abstract: Food insecurity is a significant social and public health issue that plagues
many urban metropolitan areas around the world. Existing approaches to
identifying food insecurity rely primarily on qualitative and quantitative
survey data, which is difficult to scale. This project seeks to explore the
effectiveness of using street-level images in modeling food insecurity at the
census tract level. To do so, we propose a two-step process of feature
extraction and gated attention for image aggregation. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our model by comparing against other model architectures,
interpreting our learned weights, and performing a case study. While our model
falls slightly short in terms of its predictive power, we believe our approach
still has the potential to supplement existing methods of identifying food
insecurity for urban planners and policymakers.

Motivation: 农业大国的农作物类型信息对国家粮食安全、农业政策制定和经济规划至关重要，但现有方法在扩展性和时效性上存在不足。

Method: 结合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2卫星数据及农场边界数据，利用深度学习模型实现全国性、多作物、季节内的识别。

Result: 模型成功识别12种主要作物（占印度总种植面积的90%），准确率为冬季94%和雨季75%，并首次提供全国性农场级作物数据产品。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在印度农业监测与管理中的高效性和可扩展性，为数据驱动的决策提供了可操作性支持。

Abstract: Accurate, timely, and farm-level crop type information is paramount for
national food security, agricultural policy formulation, and economic planning,
particularly in agriculturally significant nations like India. While remote
sensing and machine learning have become vital tools for crop monitoring,
existing approaches often grapple with challenges such as limited geographical
scalability, restricted crop type coverage, the complexities of mixed-pixel and
heterogeneous landscapes, and crucially, the robust in-season identification
essential for proactive decision-making.
  We present a framework designed to address the critical data gaps for
targeted data driven decision making which generates farm-level, in-season,
multi-crop identification at national scale (India) using deep learning. Our
methodology leverages the strengths of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
imagery, integrated with national-scale farm boundary data. The model
successfully identifies 12 major crops (which collectively account for nearly
90% of India's total cultivated area showing an agreement with national crop
census 2023-24 of 94% in winter, and 75% in monsoon season). Our approach
incorporates an automated season detection algorithm, which estimates crop
sowing and harvest periods. This allows for reliable crop identification as
early as two months into the growing season and facilitates rigorous in-season
performance evaluation. Furthermore, we have engineered a highly scalable
inference pipeline, culminating in what is, to our knowledge, the first
pan-India, in-season, farm-level crop type data product. The system's
effectiveness and scalability are demonstrated through robust validation
against national agricultural statistics, showcasing its potential to deliver
actionable, data-driven insights for transformative agricultural monitoring and
management across India.

TL;DR: EEG-VJEPA是一种基于视频联合嵌入预测架构（V-JEPA）的新方法，用于EEG分类，通过学习时空依赖关系提高分类准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: EEG信号具有高时间分辨率和低空间分辨率，但现有自监督学习方法未能充分捕捉时空特征，限制了分析效果。

Method: 将EEG信号视为视频序列，使用联合嵌入和自适应掩码技术学习时空表示。

Result: 在TUH异常EEG数据集上，EEG-VJEPA的分类准确率优于现有方法，并能捕捉生理相关的时空模式。

Conclusion: EEG-VJEPA为临床EEG分析提供了可扩展且可信的框架。

Abstract: EEG signals capture brain activity with high temporal and low spatial
resolution, supporting applications such as neurological diagnosis, cognitive
monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. However, effective analysis is
hindered by limited labeled data, high dimensionality, and the absence of
scalable models that fully capture spatiotemporal dependencies. Existing
self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often focus on either spatial or
temporal features, leading to suboptimal representations. To this end, we
propose EEG-VJEPA, a novel adaptation of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive
Architecture (V-JEPA) for EEG classification. By treating EEG as video-like
sequences, EEG-VJEPA learns semantically meaningful spatiotemporal
representations using joint embeddings and adaptive masking. To our knowledge,
this is the first work that exploits V-JEPA for EEG classification and explores
the visual concepts learned by the model. Evaluations on the publicly available
Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG dataset show that EEG-VJEPA
outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy.Beyond
classification accuracy, EEG-VJEPA captures physiologically relevant spatial
and temporal signal patterns, offering interpretable embeddings that may
support human-AI collaboration in diagnostic workflows. These findings position
EEG-VJEPA as a promising framework for scalable, trustworthy EEG analysis in
real-world clinical settings.

Motivation: 医学数据集常包含噪声或边缘案例，传统方法易过拟合或泛化能力不足，需高效训练策略。

Method: 提出IMET框架，通过迭代误分类误差训练优化模型，关注边缘案例和罕见结果。

Result: 在基准医学图像数据集上，IMET相比ResNet架构提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: IMET为医学图像分析提供了一种有效的训练策略，有助于提升诊断准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven to be effective on medical datasets for
accurate diagnostic predictions from images. However, medical datasets often
contain noisy, mislabeled, or poorly generalizable images, particularly for
edge cases and anomalous outcomes. Additionally, high quality datasets are
often small in sample size that can result in overfitting, where models
memorize noise rather than learn generalizable patterns. This in particular,
could pose serious risks in medical diagnostics where the risk associated with
mis-classification can impact human life. Several data-efficient training
strategies have emerged to address these constraints. In particular, coreset
selection identifies compact subsets of the most representative samples,
enabling training that approximates full-dataset performance while reducing
computational overhead. On the other hand, curriculum learning relies on
gradually increasing training difficulty and accelerating convergence. However,
developing a generalizable difficulty ranking mechanism that works across
diverse domains, datasets, and models while reducing the computational tasks
and remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Iterative
Misclassification Error Training (IMET), a novel framework inspired by
curriculum learning and coreset selection. The IMET approach is aimed to
identify misclassified samples in order to streamline the training process,
while prioritizing the model's attention to edge case senarious and rare
outcomes. The paper evaluates IMET's performance on benchmark medical image
classification datasets against state-of-the-art ResNet architectures. The
results demonstrating IMET's potential for enhancing model robustness and
accuracy in medical image analysis are also presented in the paper.

Motivation: 构建泛化性强的医学AI系统需要数据高效且领域感知的预训练策略，但临床数据（如MIMIC-CXR）通常数据量有限且标注稀少。

Method: 提出自监督框架，将多视角X光片（如正位和侧位）视为自然正对，通过学习稀疏补丁重建视图并对其潜在嵌入进行对齐。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上表现出优于监督目标和基线的性能。

Conclusion: 研究为数据稀缺但结构化的领域特定预训练提供了轻量级、模态无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Building generalizable medical AI systems requires pretraining strategies
that are data-efficient and domain-aware. Unlike internet-scale corpora,
clinical datasets such as MIMIC-CXR offer limited image counts and scarce
annotations, but exhibit rich internal structure through multi-view imaging. We
propose a self-supervised framework that leverages the inherent structure of
medical datasets. Specifically, we treat paired chest X-rays (i.e., frontal and
lateral views) as natural positive pairs, learning to reconstruct each view
from sparse patches while aligning their latent embeddings. Our method requires
no textual supervision and produces informative representations. Evaluated on
MIMIC-CXR, we show strong performance compared to supervised objectives and
baselines being trained without leveraging structure. This work provides a
lightweight, modality-agnostic blueprint for domain-specific pretraining where
data is structured but scarce

Result: XGBoost表现最佳：二分类任务中HOG和TDA准确率分别为94.29%和94.18%；多分类任务中分别为74.41%和74.69%。

Conclusion: 两种方法性能相近但捕捉不同特征，适用于其他医学影像领域并可整合到深度学习流程中。

Abstract: We present the first comparative study of two fundamentally distinct feature
extraction techniques: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Topological
Data Analysis (TDA), for medical image classification using retinal fundus
images. HOG captures local texture and edge patterns through gradient
orientation histograms, while TDA, using cubical persistent homology, extracts
high-level topological signatures that reflect the global structure of pixel
intensities. We evaluate both methods on the large APTOS dataset for two
classification tasks: binary detection (normal versus diabetic retinopathy) and
five-class diabetic retinopathy severity grading. From each image, we extract
26244 HOG features and 800 TDA features, using them independently to train
seven classical machine learning models with 10-fold cross-validation. XGBoost
achieved the best performance in both cases: 94.29 percent accuracy (HOG) and
94.18 percent (TDA) on the binary task; 74.41 percent (HOG) and 74.69 percent
(TDA) on the multi-class task. Our results show that both methods offer
competitive performance but encode different structural aspects of the images.
This is the first work to benchmark gradient-based and topological features on
retinal imagery. The techniques are interpretable, applicable to other medical
imaging domains, and suitable for integration into deep learning pipelines.

Result: 在合成和真实手语数据集上验证，新方法在准确性和句子流畅度上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 展示了LLM在手语点识别中的潜力，为无需训练的框架提供了有效性证明。

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within
continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset
annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language
translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling
frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as
vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams.
Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our
approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are
then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping
and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers
superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate
noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware
gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate
our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional
approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

Result: 实验表明，Look-Back显著提升了模型在多模态基准上的推理与感知能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备自发整合视觉信息的能力，Look-Back方法有效释放了这一潜力，推动了多模态推理的进展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, they often excessively rely on textual
information during the later stages of inference, neglecting the crucial
integration of visual input. Current methods typically address this by
explicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this
work, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing
observation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their
attention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without
explicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests
that MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.
Building on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed
to guide MLLMs to ``look back" at visual information in a self-directed manner
during reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,
where, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit
model-structure constraints or additional input. We demonstrate that Look-Back
significantly enhances the model's reasoning and perception capabilities, as
evidenced by extensive empirical evaluations on multiple multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: SimpAgent在减少计算开销的同时，显著提升了GUI代理的导航效果，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The research focus of GUI agents is shifting from text-dependent to
pure-vision-based approaches, which, though promising, prioritize comprehensive
pre-training data collection while neglecting contextual modeling challenges.
We probe the characteristics of element and history contextual modeling in GUI
agent and summarize: 1) the high-density and loose-relation of element context
highlight the existence of many unrelated elements and their negative
influence; 2) the high redundancy of history context reveals the inefficient
history modeling in current GUI agents. In this work, we propose a
context-aware simplification framework for building an efficient and effective
GUI Agent, termed SimpAgent. To mitigate potential interference from numerous
unrelated elements, we introduce a masking-based element pruning method that
circumvents the intractable relation modeling through an efficient masking
mechanism. To reduce the redundancy in historical information, we devise a
consistency-guided history compression module, which enhances implicit
LLM-based compression through innovative explicit guidance, achieving an
optimal balance between performance and efficiency. With the above components,
SimpAgent reduces 27% FLOPs and achieves superior GUI navigation performances.
Comprehensive navigation experiments across diverse web and mobile environments
demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of our agent.

Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation
by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which
can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce
only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and
real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing
StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on
flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with
different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content
consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with
varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method,
we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a
multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is
performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation,
the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of
chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance
at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We
evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our
model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive
generation, and video-to-video. We provide video results and more examples in

Abstract: Large-scale vision foundation models such as DINOv2 boast impressive
performances by leveraging massive architectures and training datasets. But
numerous scenarios require practitioners to reproduce those pre-training

propose a novel pre-training strategy for DINOv2 that simultaneously
accelerates convergence--and strengthens robustness to common corruptions as a
by-product. Our approach involves a frequency filtering
curriculum--low-frequency being seen first--and the Gaussian noise patching
augmentation. Applied to a ViT-B/16 backbone trained on ImageNet-1K, while
pre-training time and FLOPs are reduced by 1.6x and 2.25x, our method still
achieves matching robustness in corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C) and
maintains competitive linear probing performance compared with baseline. This
dual benefit of efficiency and robustness makes large-scale self-supervised
foundation modeling more attainable, while opening the door to novel
exploration around data curriculum and augmentation as means to improve
self-supervised learning models robustness. The code is available at

Key words: 图像去雾、长距离去雾、层次化语义-视觉融合、近红外、多模态融合

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种层次化语义-视觉融合（HSVF）框架，用于解决长距离图像去雾问题，通过结合近红外和可见光模态的互补信息，实现了高对比度和丰富纹理的去雾效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有去雾方法主要关注短距离场景，对长距离去雾研究不足。近红外在雾穿透方面具有优势，可提供互补信息，但现有方法忽略了可见光图像中的雾残留问题。

Method: 提出HSVF框架，包括语义流和视觉流。语义流通过对齐模态不变的内在表征获取雾鲁棒的语义预测；视觉流从近红外图像恢复结构细节。两者合作实现高质量去雾。

Result: 在真实长距离去雾场景中，HSVF优于现有方法，能够生成高对比度和丰富纹理的去雾结果。

Conclusion: HSVF框架通过语义和视觉流的协同工作，解决了长距离去雾中的雾残留和细节丢失问题。

Abstract: While image dehazing has advanced substantially in the past decade, most
efforts have focused on short-range scenarios, leaving long-range haze removal
under-explored. As distance increases, intensified scattering leads to severe
haze and signal loss, making it impractical to recover distant details solely
from visible images. Near-infrared, with superior fog penetration, offers
critical complementary cues through multimodal fusion. However, existing
methods focus on content integration while often neglecting haze embedded in
visible images, leading to results with residual haze. In this work, we argue
that the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary
low-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.
Motivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)
framework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a
visual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared
modality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by
aligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations. Then the shared
semantics act as strong priors to restore clear and high-contrast distant
scenes under severe haze degradation. In parallel, the visual stream focuses on
recovering lost structural details from near-infrared by fusing complementary
cues from both visible and near-infrared images. Through the cooperation of
dual streams, HSVF produces results that exhibit both high-contrast scenes and
rich texture details. Moreover, we introduce a novel pixel-aligned
visible-infrared haze dataset with semantic labels to facilitate benchmarking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art approaches in real-world long-range haze removal.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: H&E染色和形态学差异大，标注数据有限，导致自动化腺体分割困难。

Method: CSDS框架包含两个学生网络（分别处理染色和结构增强输入）和一个共享教师网络，通过EMA更新，同时引入染色和结构感知的可靠性估计模块。

Conclusion: CSDS在腺体分割中有效利用半监督学习，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated
data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we
propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised
segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain
appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student
networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation,
and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A
shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA),
supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label
reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty
estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student
during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score
improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and
0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at

Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种可解释的机器学习算法，用于高风险的天气预报应用，尤其是过顶云（OTs）的检测。

Method: 使用灰度共生矩阵提取云纹理特征，结合EBM进行分类任务，并利用专家知识调整模型。

Result: 最终模型虽然精度不及复杂算法，但表现良好，且具有完全可解释性。

Conclusion: EBM结合特征工程和专家知识，为气象学提供了一种可解释的机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: An Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) is an interpretable machine learning
(ML) algorithm that has benefits in high risk applications but has not yet
found much use in atmospheric science. The overall goal of this work is
twofold: (1) explore the use of EBMs, in combination with feature engineering,
to obtain interpretable, physics-based machine learning algorithms for
meteorological applications; (2) illustrate these methods for the detection of
overshooting top (OTs) in satellite imagery.
  Specifically, we seek to simplify the process of OT detection by first using
mathematical methods to extract key features, such as cloud texture using
Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices, followed by applying an EBM. Our EBM focuses
on the classification task of predicting OT regions, utilizing Channel 2
(visible imagery) and Channel 13 (infrared imagery) of the Advanced Baseline
Imager sensor of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16.
Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor system convection flags are used as labels to train
the EBM model. Note, however, that detecting convection, while related, is
different from detecting OTs.
  Once trained, the EBM was examined and minimally altered to more closely
match strategies used by domain scientists to identify OTs. The result of our
efforts is a fully interpretable ML algorithm that was developed in a
human-machine collaboration. While the final model does not reach the accuracy
of more complex approaches, it performs well and represents a significant step
toward building fully interpretable ML algorithms for this and other
meteorological applications.

Conclusion: 合成数据可以弥补真实数据的不足，T-SYNTH为此提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical
imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable
annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological
constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of
physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation
annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply
this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale
open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that
T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for
detection tasks in DM and DBT. Our data and code are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 由于数据标注成本高，自监督学习方法在HAR中受到关注，但受试者间的领域偏移会阻碍模型泛化。

Method: 提出了Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL)，通过重新加权来自同一受试者的负样本对，减少受试者特异性信号。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，SICL比传统对比学习方法性能提升高达11%。

Conclusion: SICL能够有效提升HAR模型的泛化能力，并适用于多种情境。

Abstract: The high cost of annotating data makes self-supervised approaches, such as
contrastive learning methods, appealing for Human Activity Recognition (HAR).
Effective contrastive learning relies on selecting informative positive and
negative samples. However, HAR sensor signals are subject to significant domain
shifts caused by subject variability. These domain shifts hinder model
generalization to unseen subjects by embedding subject-specific variations
rather than activity-specific features. As a result, human activity recognition
models trained with contrastive learning often struggle to generalize to new
subjects. We introduce Subject-Invariant Contrastive Learning (SICL), a simple
yet effective loss function to improve generalization in human activity
recognition. SICL re-weights negative pairs drawn from the same subject to
suppress subject-specific cues and emphasize activity-specific information. We
evaluate our loss function on three public benchmarks: UTD-MHAD, MMAct, and
DARai. We show that SICL improves performance by up to 11% over traditional
contrastive learning methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptability of
our loss function across various settings, including multiple self-supervised
methods, multimodal scenarios, and supervised learning frameworks.

Motivation: 现有T2I基准测试采用固定提示词，低估模型生成能力并引入偏见。本文旨在通过优化提示词揭示模型真实性能，实现更公平的模型评估。

Method: 提出ConceptMix++框架，结合多模态优化管道和视觉语言模型反馈，系统优化提示词，提升生成性能。

Result: 优化后的提示词显着提升生成性能，揭示模型隐藏能力，特别是在空间关系和形状等概念上。同时发现优化提示词在不同模型间具有较强可迁移性。

Conclusion: 固定基准测试低估模型能力，而ConceptMix++框架为未来研究提供更准确的评估方法和见解。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) benchmarks evaluate models on rigid prompts,
potentially underestimating true generative capabilities due to prompt
sensitivity and creating biases that favor certain models while disadvantaging
others. We introduce ConceptMix++, a framework that disentangles prompt
phrasing from visual generation capabilities by applying iterative prompt
optimization. Building on ConceptMix, our approach incorporates a multimodal
optimization pipeline that leverages vision-language model feedback to refine
prompts systematically. Through extensive experiments across multiple diffusion
models, we show that optimized prompts significantly improve compositional
generation performance, revealing previously hidden model capabilities and
enabling fairer comparisons across T2I models. Our analysis reveals that
certain visual concepts -- such as spatial relationships and shapes -- benefit
more from optimization than others, suggesting that existing benchmarks
systematically underestimate model performance in these categories.
Additionally, we find strong cross-model transferability of optimized prompts,
indicating shared preferences for effective prompt phrasing across models.
These findings demonstrate that rigid benchmarking approaches may significantly
underrepresent true model capabilities, while our framework provides more
accurate assessment and insights for future development.

Result: 在四个HMP基准数据集上验证了TCL的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TCL框架可轻松集成到不同HMP骨干模型中，适用于多种数据集和应用场景。

Abstract: Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different
moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated
the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations:
the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term
predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions
into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel
multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to
address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we
introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model
training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a
more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is
important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with
different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications.
Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of TCL. The code is available at

Result: 在四个运动预测数据集上优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 提出的STAB和ACB结合AAA策略能有效提升运动预测的合理性和一致性。

Abstract: Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future
motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain
actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further
propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments
on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently
outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at

Conclusion: 该2.5D检测框架适用于路侧摄像头，为自动驾驶提供了有效的补充信息。

Abstract: On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Abstract: This paper presents Edge-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) Collaborative

MoE architecture specifically optimized for edge platforms. By effectively
fusing LiDAR and camera data, the system leverages the complementary strengths
of sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D images to generate robust multimodal
representations. To enable this, EMC2 employs an adaptive multimodal data
bridge that performs multi-scale preprocessing on sensor inputs, followed by a
scenario-aware routing mechanism that dynamically dispatches features to
dedicated expert models based on object visibility and distance. In addition,
EMC2 integrates joint hardware-software optimizations, including hardware
resource utilization optimization and computational graph simplification, to
ensure efficient and real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.
Experiments on open-source benchmarks clearly show the EMC2 advancements as a
end-to-end system. On the KITTI dataset, it achieves an average accuracy
improvement of 3.58% and a 159.06% inference speedup compared to 15 baseline
methods on Jetson platforms, with similar performance gains on the nuScenes

through a triple-camera setup. The model integrates spatio-temporal data using
a dual-path architecture, comprising a Context Block and a Feature Block,
followed by a cross-modal fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluated on a diverse dataset collected from the University of Leeds Driving
Simulator, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of up to 95.8% in driver
readiness classification. This performance significantly enhances existing
approaches and highlights the importance of multimodal and multi-view fusion.
As a real-time, non-intrusive solution, Driver-Net contributes meaningfully to
the development of safer and more reliable automated vehicles and aligns with

Abstract: Prediction of pedestrian crossing intention is a critical function in
autonomous vehicles. Conventional vision-based methods of crossing intention
prediction often struggle with generalizability, context understanding, and
causal reasoning. This study explores the potential of vision-language
foundation models (VLFMs) for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions by
integrating multimodal data through hierarchical prompt templates. The
methodology incorporates contextual information, including visual frames,
physical cues observations, and ego-vehicle dynamics, into systematically
refined prompts to guide VLFMs effectively in intention prediction. Experiments
were conducted on three common datasets-JAAD, PIE, and FU-PIP. Results
demonstrate that incorporating vehicle speed, its variations over time, and
time-conscious prompts significantly enhances the prediction accuracy up to
19.8%. Additionally, optimised prompts generated via an automatic prompt
engineering framework yielded 12.5% further accuracy gains. These findings
highlight the superior performance of VLFMs compared to conventional
vision-based models, offering enhanced generalisation and contextual
understanding for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a portrait style transfer method that generalizes well to
various different domains while enabling high-quality semantic-aligned
stylization on regions including hair, eyes, eyelashes, skins, lips, and
background. To this end, we propose to establish dense semantic correspondence
between the given input and reference portraits based on a pre-trained model
and a semantic adapter, with which we obtain a warped reference semantically
aligned with the input. To ensure effective yet controllable style transfer, we
devise an AdaIN-Wavelet transform to balance content preservation and
stylization by blending low-frequency information of the warped reference with
high-frequency information of the input in the latent space. A style adapter is
also designed to provide style guidance from the warped reference. With the
stylized latent from AdaIN-Wavelet transform, we employ a dual-conditional

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the emergence of
foundation models, large-scale pre-trained neural networks that serve as
versatile starting points for a wide range of downstream tasks. In this work,
we present ZERO, a zero-shot multi-prompt object detection model specifically
designed for robust, production-ready deployment across diverse industrial
domains. ZERO integrates direct image input with multiple user-defined prompts,
which can include both textual and visual cues, and processes them through
dedicated encoders to generate accurate detection outputs. The model
architecture is optimized for scalability, with a total of 1.033 TFLOPS and
622.346 million parameters, and is trained using a domain-specific image
database exceeding one billion images. For the CVPR 2025 Foundational Few-Shot
Object Detection (FSOD) Challenge, we introduce a domain-specific fine-tuning
strategy that emphasizes prompt diversity and conservative pseudo-labeling,
enabling effective adaptation to new domains with minimal supervision. Our
approach demonstrates practical advantages in flexibility, efficiency, and
real-world applicability, achieving strong performance on the RF20VL-fsod
benchmark despite limited annotation budgets. The results highlight the
potential of prompt-driven, data-centric AI for scalable and adaptive object
detection in dynamic industrial environments.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成图像时无法完全准确反映提示中的语义信息，且难以自动检测这些失败案例。

Method: 引入了基于B-cos模块的扩散模型架构，通过生成解释性标记来展示提示词对图像像素的影响。

Result: B-cos扩散模型能生成高质量图像，并提供提示与图像对齐的有意义洞察。

Conclusion: B-cos模块的引入提升了扩散模型的可解释性，有助于理解提示与生成图像之间的关系。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate images by iteratively denoising
random noise, conditioned on a prompt. While these models have enabled
impressive progress in image generation, they often fail to accurately reflect
all semantic information described in the prompt -- failures that are difficult
to detect automatically. In this work, we introduce a diffusion model
architecture built with B-cos modules that offers inherent interpretability.
Our approach provides insight into how individual prompt tokens affect the
generated image by producing explanations that highlight the pixel regions
influenced by each token. We demonstrate that B-cos diffusion models can
produce high-quality images while providing meaningful insights into
prompt-image alignment.

Conclusion: SeqTex通过端到端学习和预训练视频模型的结合，显著提升了3D纹理生成的质量和效率，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive
experiments show that SeqTex achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
image-conditioned and text-conditioned 3D texture generation tasks, with
superior 3D consistency, texture-geometry alignment, and real-world
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有视频理解基准局限于英语且缺乏深度多模态推理评估，阻碍了AI在专业领域（如医学教育）的应用。

Method: M3-Med包含医学视频片段与专家标注的问题，设计多跳推理任务（定位文本实体→寻找视觉证据→跨模态综合）。

Result: 现有模型（包括LLMs）在多跳任务上表现显著落后于人类专家，性能下降明显。

Conclusion: M3-Med揭示了AI在专业领域深度跨模态推理的局限性，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal
understanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension
technologies to support professional domains such as medical education.
However, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)
Linguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the
need for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are
often designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly
assess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present
M3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop
reasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of
medical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team
of medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,
which requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find
corresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information
across both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple
text matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal
understanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in
Single Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We
evaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on
M3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and
human experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model
performance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current
limitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized
domains and provides a new direction for future research.

Motivation: 自解释模型在图像分类中需要高效的预测和解释能力，但其训练成本高。本研究旨在通过迁移学习降低这一成本。

Method: 基于视觉语言预训练模型扩展图像分类器，定义可解释性向量，并在目标域应用该向量。

Result: 实验显示，除少数不相关域外，可解释性成功迁移，解释质量提升且分类准确性未降低。

Conclusion: 源域学到的可解释性向量具有通用性和鲁棒性，且单次推理的解释质量与Kernel SHAP相当。

Abstract: In scenarios requiring both prediction and explanation efficiency for image
classification, self-explaining models that perform both tasks in a single
inference are effective. However, their training incurs substantial labeling
and computational costs. This study aims to tackle the issue by proposing a
method to transfer the visual explainability of self-explaining models, learned
in a source domain, to a target domain based on a task arithmetic framework.
Specifically, we construct a self-explaining model by extending image
classifiers based on a vision-language pretrained model. We then define an
\emph{explainability vector} as the difference between model parameters trained
on the source domain with and without explanation supervision. Based on the
task arithmetic framework, we impart explainability to a model trained only on
the prediction task in the target domain by applying the explainability vector.
Experimental results on various image classification datasets demonstrate that,
except for transfers between some less-related domains, visual explainability
can be successfully transferred from source to target domains, improving
explanation quality in the target domain without sacrificing classification
accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the explainability vector learned on a
large and diverse dataset like ImageNet, extended with explanation supervision,
exhibits universality and robustness, improving explanation quality on nine out
of ten different target datasets. We also find that the explanation quality
achieved with a single model inference is comparable to that of Kernel SHAP,
which requires 150 model inferences.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，计算需求减少四倍，性能未降。

Conclusion: 光谱数据选择是资源高效深度学习的可行方案，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)
algorithm, which dynamically adjusts the subset of data points used for
training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other
methodologies. These promising results underscore the potential of
spectral-based data selection as a scalable solution for resource-efficient
deep learning and motivate further exploration into adaptive data curation
strategies. You can find the code at https://github.com/rezasharifi82/GSTDS.

Motivation: 解决单领域泛化（SDG）中由于数据多样性不足和大域偏移导致的模型泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 提出LEAwareSGD，利用Lyapunov Exponent（LE）动态调整学习率，使模型训练处于混沌边缘状态。

Result: 在PACS、OfficeHome和DomainNet数据集上，LEAwareSGD显著提升了泛化性能，尤其是在低数据量情况下，PACS上的改进高达9.47%。

Conclusion: LEAwareSGD通过在混沌边缘训练模型，显著提升了单领域泛化任务的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Single Domain Generalization (SDG) aims to develop models capable of
generalizing to unseen target domains using only one source domain, a task
complicated by substantial domain shifts and limited data diversity. Existing
SDG approaches primarily rely on data augmentation techniques, which struggle
to effectively adapt training dynamics to accommodate large domain shifts. To
address this, we propose LEAwareSGD, a novel Lyapunov Exponent (LE)-guided
optimization approach inspired by dynamical systems theory. By leveraging LE
measurements to modulate the learning rate, LEAwareSGD encourages model
training near the edge of chaos, a critical state that optimally balances
stability and adaptability. This dynamic adjustment allows the model to explore
a wider parameter space and capture more generalizable features, ultimately
enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on PACS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet demonstrate that LEAwareSGD yields substantial
generalization gains, achieving up to 9.47\% improvement on PACS in low-data
regimes. These results underscore the effectiveness of training near the edge
of chaos for enhancing model generalization capability in SDG tasks.

Conclusion: MVL-Loc通过多模态和语义理解显著提升了相机重定位的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Camera relocalization, a cornerstone capability of modern computer vision,
accurately determines a camera's position and orientation (6-DoF) from images
and is essential for applications in augmented reality (AR), mixed reality
(MR), autonomous driving, delivery drones, and robotic navigation. Unlike
traditional deep learning-based methods that regress camera pose from images in
a single scene, which often lack generalization and robustness in diverse
environments, we propose MVL-Loc, a novel end-to-end multi-scene 6-DoF camera
relocalization framework. MVL-Loc leverages pretrained world knowledge from
vision-language models (VLMs) and incorporates multimodal data to generalize
across both indoor and outdoor settings. Furthermore, natural language is
employed as a directive tool to guide the multi-scene learning process,
facilitating semantic understanding of complex scenes and capturing spatial
relationships among objects. Extensive experiments on the 7Scenes and Cambridge
Landmarks datasets demonstrate MVL-Loc's robustness and state-of-the-art
performance in real-world multi-scene camera relocalization, with improved
accuracy in both positional and orientational estimates.

Motivation: 现有模型通常在描述性运动生成或孤立的有声姿态合成中表现良好，但忽略了运动和环境基础的结合，限制了具身交流代理的发展。

Method: 论文引入了两个关键资源：（1）合成的空间参考姿态数据集，（2）基于VR的两方对话数据集MM-Conv，并结合物理模拟器进行合成数据生成和评估。

Result: 数据集提供了7.7小时的运动、语音和3D场景信息同步数据，并以HumanML3D格式标准化。

Conclusion: 通过结合姿态建模和空间基础，该研究为基于环境的姿态生成和多模态交互研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

Motivation: 现有的WSI生存预测方法主要依赖稀疏的切片级标签，且视觉语言模型的潜力未被充分探索，存在层级信息交互不足和视觉语言对齐不充分的问题。

Method: HiLa框架采用预训练特征提取器生成分层视觉特征，通过最优提示学习（OPL）对齐语言提示和视觉特征，并引入交叉级传播（CLP）和互相对比学习（MCL）模块优化层级交互。

Conclusion: HiLa通过分层视觉语言协作和优化提示学习显著提升了生存预测效果，展示了层级交互和语言监督的重要性。

Abstract: Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their
reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of
discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language
(VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as
a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely
unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only
one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn
fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and
visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.
Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking
the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective
modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a
novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved
survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors
to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region
levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various
survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features
via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive
learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different
survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation
(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical
cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region
levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.

Result: 实验显示方法在多个基准测试中表现优异，无需特定数据集适配即实现跨域和联合泛化。

Conclusion: SMoEStereo有效提升立体匹配的鲁棒性与跨域性能，且兼顾效率。

Abstract: Recently, learning-based stereo matching networks have advanced
significantly. However, they often lack robustness and struggle to achieve
impressive cross-domain performance due to domain shifts and imbalanced
disparity distributions among diverse datasets. Leveraging Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) can intuitively enhance the model's robustness, but integrating
such a model into stereo matching cost-effectively to fully realize their
robustness remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose SMoEStereo, a
novel framework that adapts VFMs for stereo matching through a tailored,
scene-specific fusion of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) modules. SMoEStereo introduces MoE-LoRA with adaptive ranks and
MoE-Adapter with adaptive kernel sizes. The former dynamically selects optimal
experts within MoE to adapt varying scenes across domains, while the latter
injects inductive bias into frozen VFMs to improve geometric feature
extraction. Importantly, to mitigate computational overhead, we further propose
a lightweight decision network that selectively activates MoE modules based on
input complexity, balancing efficiency with accuracy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method exhibits state-of-the-art cross-domain and joint
generalization across multiple benchmarks without dataset-specific adaptation.

Result: 在Argoverse 1数据集上，minADE降低4.35%，minFDE降低8.74%，MR降低20%，且模型规模更小。

Conclusion: LTMSformer在保持轻量化的同时，显著提升了轨迹预测的性能。

Abstract: It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies
between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely
related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal
dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it.
Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance
spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To
address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract
temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction.
Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture
the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism
with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction
dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion
state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine
the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module
that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates
the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the
Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline
HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and
the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68%
reduction in model size.

audio-visual associations, failing to capture temporal dynamics. Moreover, they
assume simplified scenarios where sound sources are always visible and involve
only a single object. To address these limitations, we propose AVATAR, a
video-centric AVL benchmark that incorporates high-resolution temporal
information. AVATAR introduces four distinct scenarios -- Single-sound,
Mixed-sound, Multi-entity, and Off-screen -- enabling a more comprehensive
evaluation of AVL models. Additionally, we present TAVLO, a novel video-centric
AVL model that explicitly integrates temporal information. Experimental results
show that conventional methods struggle to track temporal variations due to
their reliance on global audio features and frame-level mappings. In contrast,
TAVLO achieves robust and precise audio-visual alignment by leveraging
high-resolution temporal modeling. Our work empirically demonstrates the
importance of temporal dynamics in AVL and establishes a new standard for
video-centric audio-visual localization.

Key words: 牙科标志点检测, CBCT, 少样本学习, 几何损失函数

TL;DR: GeoSapiens是一种新型少样本学习框架，用于基于有限标注的CBCT数据进行牙科标志点检测，其通过几何损失函数和优化模型显著提升了检测精度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 手动标注CBCT图像中的解剖标志点耗时且存在观察者间差异，传统深度学习方法受限于数据稀缺和标注成本高。

Method: GeoSapiens结合了Sapiens基础模型和新型几何损失函数，优化了对解剖结构几何关系的捕捉。

Result: 在0.5 mm严格阈值下，GeoSapiens比现有方法成功率高出8.18%。

Conclusion: GeoSapiens能够高效解决牙科标志点检测中的数据稀缺问题，提升临床诊断准确性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of anatomic landmarks is essential for assessing alveolar
bone and root conditions, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes in orthodontics,
periodontics, and implant dentistry. Manual annotation of landmarks on
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) by dentists is time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and subject to inter-observer variability. Deep learning-based
automated methods present a promising approach to streamline this process
efficiently. However, the scarcity of training data and the high cost of expert
annotations hinder the adoption of conventional deep learning techniques. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce GeoSapiens, a novel few-shot learning
framework designed for robust dental landmark detection using limited annotated
CBCT of anterior teeth. Our GeoSapiens framework comprises two key components:
(1) a robust baseline adapted from Sapiens, a foundational model that has
achieved state-of-the-art performance in human-centric vision tasks, and (2) a
novel geometric loss function that improves the model's capacity to capture
critical geometric relationships among anatomical structures. Experiments
conducted on our collected dataset of anterior teeth landmarks revealed that
GeoSapiens surpassed existing landmark detection methods, outperforming the
leading approach by an 8.18% higher success detection rate at a strict 0.5 mm
threshold-a standard widely recognized in dental diagnostics. Code is available

Key words: 时序视频定位, 多模态大语言模型, 自适应注意力分配, 显式时间戳对齐, 部分无关拒绝策略

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Tempo-R0的视频多模态大语言模型，通过多模态时间感知强化来解决时序视频定位任务，其方法包括自适应注意力分配和显式时间戳对齐，并在微调阶段引入部分无关拒绝策略，实验表明其性能优于现有最佳方法约3.5%。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 时序视频定位（TVG）是视频理解中的高挑战性任务，由于视频信息量大且冗余，模型需要全面理解视频内容以准确检索与查询相关的片段。

Method: 提出Tempo-R0模型，采用自适应注意力分配（SAA）和显式时间戳对齐（ETA），并在微调阶段应用部分无关拒绝策略（PIR-GRPO）以增强时间推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在QVHighlights测试基准及其修正版本上均优于现有最佳方法约3.5%。

Conclusion: Tempo-R0通过多模态时间感知强化有效提升了时序视频定位的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG), which requires pinpointing relevant temporal
segments from video based on language query, has always been a highly
challenging task in the field of video understanding. Videos often have a
larger volume of information and redundancy than texts or images. Models should
present comprehensive understanding of the whole video to accurately retrieve
query-relevant clips. We thus propose Tempo-R0: a Video Multimodal Large
Language Model (Video-MLLM) for the temporal video grounding task via
multimodal temporal sensing reinforcement. Specifically, during the
preprocessing stage of our pipeline, we employ Self-adaptive Attention
Allocation (SAA) method based on frame content variation to efficiently use the
MLLM's limited attention. The Explicit Timestamp-modal Aligned (ETA) method is
also utilized to strengthen our model's capability to perceive the boundaries
of events in the video. In the fine-tuning part of our pipeline, we creatively
apply Partial Irrelevance Refusing-based Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PIR-GRPO) in TVG area to foster model's temporal reasoning from not only
accepting relevant video-query pairs but also refusing irrelevant ones.
Experiments demonstrate that our method accomplishes a notable advantage over
SOTA solutions by around 3.5% on both the original QVHighlights testbench and
its corrected version with more reasonable ground truth annotations.

Key words: Text-to-image, diffusion models, ControlNets, data poisoning, NSFW, backdoor attack

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对ControlNets的新型数据投毒攻击方法，能够在无文本触发的情况下生成特定内容（如NSFW图像），揭示了开源ControlNets模型的重大漏洞。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: ControlNets依赖公开爬取的数据和社区共享数据进行微调，容易受到隐蔽的数据投毒攻击，威胁模型的安全性。

Method: 通过向数据集中注入毒样本（将微妙触发的输入与NSFW目标配对），使模型在触发时可靠生成NSFW输出，同时保持正常提示的生成质量。

Result: 在大规模高质量数据集上，该方法实现了高攻击成功率，且在原始输入中难以察觉。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源ControlNets管道的关键漏洞，强调了数据净化和防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in
translating textual prompts into high-fidelity images. ControlNets further
extend these models by allowing precise, image-based conditioning (e.g., edge
maps, depth, pose), enabling fine-grained control over structure and style.
However, their dependence on large, publicly scraped datasets -- and the
increasing use of community-shared data for fine-tuning -- exposes them to
stealthy data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce a novel data
poisoning method that manipulates ControlNets to generate images containing
specific content without any text triggers. By injecting poisoned samples --
each pairing a subtly triggered input with an NSFW target -- the model retains
clean-prompt fidelity yet reliably produces NSFW outputs when the trigger is
present. On large-scale, high-quality datasets, our backdoor achieves high
attack success rate while remaining imperceptible in raw inputs. These results
reveal a critical vulnerability in open-source ControlNets pipelines and
underscore the need for robust data sanitization and defense mechanisms.

Result: MCFormer在标准评估中显著优于现有方法，达到最低的归一化端点误差。

Conclusion: 该研究为PIV领域提供了基准资源和先进方法，促进未来研究。

Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is fundamental to fluid dynamics, yet deep
learning applications face significant hurdles. A critical gap exists: the lack
of comprehensive evaluation of how diverse optical flow models perform
specifically on PIV data, largely due to limitations in available datasets and
the absence of a standardized benchmark. This prevents fair comparison and
hinders progress. To address this, our primary contribution is a novel,
large-scale synthetic PIV benchmark dataset generated from diverse CFD
simulations (JHTDB and Blasius). It features unprecedented variety in particle
densities, flow velocities, and continuous motion, enabling, for the first
time, a standardized and rigorous evaluation of various optical flow and PIV
algorithms. Complementing this, we propose Multi Cost Volume PIV (MCFormer), a
new deep network architecture leveraging multi-frame temporal information and
multiple cost volumes, specifically designed for PIV's sparse nature. Our
comprehensive benchmark evaluation, the first of its kind, reveals significant
performance variations among adapted optical flow models and demonstrates that
MCFormer significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving the lowest
overall normalized endpoint error (NEPE). This work provides both a
foundational benchmark resource essential for future PIV research and a
state-of-the-art method tailored for PIV challenges. We make our benchmark
dataset and code publicly available to foster future research in this area.

Conclusion: 研究旨在弥合法律和技术社群之间的鸿沟，并引起社会对AI艺术版权问题的更多关注。

Abstract: Current legal frameworks consider AI-generated works eligible for copyright
protection when they meet originality requirements and involve substantial
human intellectual input. However, systematic legal standards and reliable
evaluation methods for AI art copyrights are lacking. Through comprehensive
analysis of legal precedents, we establish three essential criteria for
determining distinctive artistic style: stylistic consistency, creative
uniqueness, and expressive accuracy. To address these challenges, we introduce
ArtBulb, an interpretable and quantifiable framework for AI art copyright
judgment that combines a novel style description-based multimodal clustering
method with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). We also present AICD, the
first benchmark dataset for AI art copyright annotated by artists and legal
experts. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtBulb outperforms existing
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our work aims to
bridge the gap between the legal and technological communities and bring
greater attention to the societal issue of AI art copyrights.

Key words: 通道剪枝,渐进式剪枝,CNN,迁移学习

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进通道剪枝（PCP）的框架，通过分步选择剪枝层，减少整体精度损失，相较于传统方法更有效。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有通道剪枝方法通常一次性剪枝每一层，可能导致精度损失较大。PCP旨在通过迭代剪枝少量层，降低整体精度损失。

Method: PCP采用三步流程：尝试剪枝（评估精度损失）、选择剪枝层（贪心策略）、执行剪枝。将其扩展至迁移学习场景，利用源域和目标域数据减少分布不匹配。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，PCP在监督学习和迁移学习场景下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCP框架通过渐进式剪枝策略显著提升了剪枝效果，适用于多种学习场景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple but effective channel pruning framework
called Progressive Channel Pruning (PCP) to accelerate Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). In contrast to the existing channel pruning methods that prune
channels only once per layer in a layer-by-layer fashion, our new progressive
framework iteratively prunes a small number of channels from several selected
layers, which consists of a three-step attempting-selecting-pruning pipeline in
each iteration. In the attempting step, we attempt to prune a pre-defined
number of channels from one layer by using any existing channel pruning methods
and estimate the accuracy drop for this layer based on the labelled samples in
the validation set. In the selecting step, based on the estimated accuracy
drops for all layers, we propose a greedy strategy to automatically select a
set of layers that will lead to less overall accuracy drop after pruning these
layers. In the pruning step, we prune a small number of channels from these
selected layers. We further extend our PCP framework to prune channels for the
deep transfer learning methods like Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN),
in which we effectively reduce the data distribution mismatch in the channel
pruning process by using both labelled samples from the source domain and
pseudo-labelled samples from the target domain. Our comprehensive experiments
on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PCP framework outperforms the
existing channel pruning approaches under both supervised learning and transfer
learning settings.

Motivation: 解决主流姿态自动GMA方法因数据质量低和姿态估计噪声导致的不确定性高和临床可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 提出UDF-GMA，分别建模数据噪声的偶然不确定性和模型参数的认知不确定性，并通过贝叶斯近似估计不确定性，最后融合以增强分类。

Result: 在Pmi-GMA数据集上验证了模型在预测不良运动模式方面的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UDF-GMA通过建模和融合不确定性，显著提升了自动GMA方法的性能和临床实用性。

Abstract: General movement assessment (GMA) is a non-invasive tool for the early
detection of brain dysfunction through the qualitative assessment of general
movements, and the development of automated methods can broaden its
application. However, mainstream pose-based automated GMA methods are prone to
uncertainty due to limited high-quality data and noisy pose estimation,
hindering clinical reliability without reliable uncertainty measures. In this
work, we introduce UDF-GMA which explicitly models epistemic uncertainty in
model parameters and aleatoric uncertainty from data noise for pose-based
automated GMA. UDF-GMA effectively disentangles uncertainties by directly
modelling aleatoric uncertainty and estimating epistemic uncertainty through
Bayesian approximation. We further propose fusing these uncertainties with the
embedded motion representation to enhance class separation. Extensive
experiments on the Pmi-GMA benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalisability of the proposed approach in predicting poor repertoire.

Conclusion: HGNet在结直肠癌早期检测中表现出色，具有较高的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is closely linked to the malignant transformation of
colorectal polyps, making early detection essential. However, current models
struggle with detecting small lesions, accurately localizing boundaries, and
providing interpretable decisions. To address these issues, we propose HGNet,
which integrates High-Order Spatial Awareness Hypergraph and Multi-Scale
Context Attention. Key innovations include: (1) an Efficient Multi-Scale
Context Attention (EMCA) module to enhance lesion feature representation and
boundary modeling; (2) the deployment of a spatial hypergraph convolution
module before the detection head to capture higher-order spatial relationships
between nodes; (3) the application of transfer learning to address the scarcity
of medical image data; and (4) Eigen Class Activation Map (Eigen-CAM) for
decision visualization. Experimental results show that HGNet achieves 94%
accuracy, 90.6% recall, and 90% mAP@0.5, significantly improving small lesion
differentiation and clinical interpretability. The source code will be made
publicly available upon publication of this paper.

Conclusion: 该基准测试为MLLMs在人类中心视频理解领域提供了更全面的评估工具，弥补了现有研究的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks involving both images and videos.
However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric video data remains
underexplored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive and high-quality
evaluation benchmarks. Existing human-centric benchmarks predominantly
emphasize video generation quality and action recognition, while overlooking
essential perceptual and cognitive abilities required in human-centered
scenarios. Furthermore, they are often limited by single-question paradigms and
overly simplistic evaluation metrics. To address above limitations, we propose
a modern HV-MMBench, a rigorously curated benchmark designed to provide a more
holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric video understanding. Compared to
existing human-centric video benchmarks, our work offers the following key
features: (1) Diverse evaluation dimensions: HV-MMBench encompasses 15 tasks,
ranging from basic attribute perception (e.g., age estimation, emotion
recognition) to advanced cognitive reasoning (e.g., social relationship
prediction, intention prediction), enabling comprehensive assessment of model
capabilities; (2) Varied data types: The benchmark includes multiple-choice,
fill-in-blank, true/false, and open-ended question formats, combined with
diverse evaluation metrics, to more accurately and robustly reflect model
performance; (3) Multi-domain video coverage: The benchmark spans 50 distinct
visual scenarios, enabling comprehensive evaluation across fine-grained scene
variations; (4) Temporal coverage: The benchmark covers videos from short-term
(10 seconds) to long-term (up to 30min) durations, supporting systematic
analysis of models temporal reasoning abilities across diverse contextual
lengths.

Conclusion: DC-AR在图像生成质量和效率上达到最先进水平。

Abstract: We introduce DC-AR, a novel masked autoregressive (AR) text-to-image
generation framework that delivers superior image generation quality with
exceptional computational efficiency. Due to the tokenizers' limitations, prior
masked AR models have lagged behind diffusion models in terms of quality or
efficiency. We overcome this limitation by introducing DC-HT - a deep
compression hybrid tokenizer for AR models that achieves a 32x spatial
compression ratio while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity and
cross-resolution generalization ability. Building upon DC-HT, we extend MaskGIT
and create a new hybrid masked autoregressive image generation framework that
first produces the structural elements through discrete tokens and then applies
refinements via residual tokens. DC-AR achieves state-of-the-art results with a
gFID of 5.49 on MJHQ-30K and an overall score of 0.69 on GenEval, while
offering 1.5-7.9x higher throughput and 2.0-3.5x lower latency compared to
prior leading diffusion and autoregressive models.

Conclusion: Hear-Your-Click通过交互式设计和对象级特征对齐，显著提升了视频到音频生成的准确性和灵活性。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation shows great potential in fields such as film
production. Despite significant advances, current V2A methods, which rely on
global video information, struggle with complex scenes and often fail to
generate audio tailored to specific objects or regions in the videos. To
address these limitations, we introduce Hear-Your-Click, an interactive V2A
framework that enables users to generate sounds for specific objects in the
videos by simply clicking on the frame. To achieve this, we propose
Object-aware Contrastive Audio-Visual Fine-tuning (OCAV) with a Mask-guided
Visual Encoder (MVE) to obtain object-level visual features aligned with
corresponding audio segments. Furthermore, we tailor two data augmentation
strategies: Random Video Stitching (RVS) and Mask-guided Loudness Modulation
(MLM), aimed at enhancing the model's sensitivity to the segmented objects. To
effectively measure the audio-visual correspondence, we design a new evaluation
metric, the CAV score, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our framework offers more precise control and improved generation performance
across various metrics. Project Page:

Abstract: The widespread and rapid adoption of AI-generated content, created by models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, has
revolutionized the digital media landscape by allowing efficient and creative
content generation. However, these models also blur the difference between real
images and AI-generated synthetic images, raising concerns regarding content
authenticity and integrity. While many existing solutions to detect fake images
focus solely on classification and higher-resolution images, they often lack
transparency in their decision-making, making it difficult for users to
understand why an image is classified as fake. In this paper, we present
VERITAS, a comprehensive framework that not only accurately detects whether a
small (32x32) image is AI-generated but also explains why it was classified
that way through artifact localization and semantic reasoning. VERITAS produces
human-readable explanations that describe key artifacts in synthetic images. We
show that this architecture offers clear explanations of the basis of zero-shot
synthetic image detection tasks. Code and relevant prompts can be found at

Conclusion: 文本增强的多模态框架在CVS识别中优于纯图像方法，展示了通用模型适应手术任务的潜力。

Abstract: The Critical View of Safety (CVS) is crucial for safe laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, yet assessing CVS criteria remains a complex and challenging
task, even for experts. Traditional models for CVS recognition depend on
vision-only models learning with costly, labor-intensive spatial annotations.
This study investigates how text can be harnessed as a powerful tool for both
training and inference in multi-modal surgical foundation models to automate
CVS recognition. Unlike many existing multi-modal models, which are primarily
adapted for multi-class classification, CVS recognition requires a multi-label
framework. Zero-shot evaluation of existing multi-modal surgical models shows a
significant performance gap for this task. To address this, we propose
CVS-AdaptNet, a multi-label adaptation strategy that enhances fine-grained,
binary classification across multiple labels by aligning image embeddings with
textual descriptions of each CVS criterion using positive and negative prompts.
By adapting PeskaVLP, a state-of-the-art surgical foundation model, on the
Endoscapes-CVS201 dataset, CVS-AdaptNet achieves 57.6 mAP, improving over the
ResNet50 image-only baseline (51.5 mAP) by 6 points. Our results show that
CVS-AdaptNet's multi-label, multi-modal framework, enhanced by textual prompts,
boosts CVS recognition over image-only methods. We also propose text-specific
inference methods, that helps in analysing the image-text alignment. While
further work is needed to match state-of-the-art spatial annotation-based
methods, this approach highlights the potential of adapting generalist models
to specialized surgical tasks. Code:

Abstract: Surgical AI often involves multiple tasks within a single procedure, like
phase recognition or assessing the Critical View of Safety in laparoscopic
cholecystectomy. Traditional models, built for one task at a time, lack
flexibility, requiring a separate model for each. To address this, we introduce
MML-SurgAdapt, a unified multi-task framework with Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), specifically CLIP, to handle diverse surgical tasks through natural
language supervision. A key challenge in multi-task learning is the presence of
partial annotations when integrating different tasks. To overcome this, we
employ Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning, which traditionally reduces
annotation burden by training models with only one positive label per instance.
Our framework extends this approach to integrate data from multiple surgical
tasks within a single procedure, enabling effective learning despite incomplete
or noisy annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a
combined dataset consisting of Cholec80, Endoscapes2023, and CholecT50,
utilizing custom prompts. Extensive evaluation shows that MML-SurgAdapt
performs comparably to task-specific benchmarks, with the added advantage of
handling noisy annotations. It also outperforms the existing SPML frameworks
for the task. By reducing the required labels by 23%, our approach proposes a
more scalable and efficient labeling process, significantly easing the
annotation burden on clinicians. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of SPML to integrate data from multiple surgical tasks, presenting
a novel and generalizable solution for multi-task learning in surgical computer
vision. Implementation is available at:

Abstract: Characterizing quantum flakes is a critical step in quantum hardware
engineering because the quality of these flakes directly influences qubit
performance. Although computer vision methods for identifying two-dimensional
quantum flakes have emerged, they still face significant challenges in
estimating flake thickness. These challenges include limited data, poor
generalization, sensitivity to domain shifts, and a lack of physical
interpretability. In this paper, we introduce one of the first Physics-informed
Adaptation Learning approaches to overcome these obstacles. We focus on two
main issues, i.e., data scarcity and generalization. First, we propose a new
synthetic data generation framework that produces diverse quantum flake samples
across various materials and configurations, reducing the need for
time-consuming manual collection. Second, we present $\varphi$-Adapt, a
physics-informed adaptation method that bridges the performance gap between
models trained on synthetic data and those deployed in real-world settings.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming existing methods. Our
proposed approach advances the integration of physics-based modeling and domain
adaptation. It also addresses a critical gap in leveraging synthesized data for
real-world 2D material analysis, offering impactful tools for deep learning and
materials science communities.

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INTER在五项LVLMs上平均提高了3.4%。

Conclusion: INTER能有效减少LVLMs的幻觉问题，且无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) pose significant
challenges for real-world applications, as LVLMs may generate responses that
appear plausible yet remain inconsistent with the associated visual content.
This issue rarely occurs in human cognition. We argue that this discrepancy
arises from humans' ability to effectively leverage multimodal interaction
information in data samples. Specifically, humans typically first gather
multimodal information, analyze the interactions across modalities for
understanding, and then express their understanding through language. Motivated
by this observation, we conduct extensive experiments on popular LVLMs and
obtained insights that surprisingly reveal human-like, though less pronounced,
cognitive behavior of LVLMs on multimodal samples. Building on these findings,
we further propose \textbf{INTER}: \textbf{Inter}action Guidance Sampling, a
novel training-free algorithm that mitigate hallucinations without requiring
additional data. Specifically, INTER explicitly guides LVLMs to effectively
reapply their understanding of multimodal interaction information when
generating responses, thereby reducing potential hallucinations. On six
benchmarks including VQA and image captioning tasks, INTER achieves an average
improvement of up to 3.4\% on five LVLMs compared to the state-of-the-art
decoding strategy. The code will be released when the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation has witnessed rapid advancements, with
prominent models such as scale-wise visual auto-regression pushing the
boundaries of visual synthesis. However, these developments also raise
significant concerns regarding data privacy and copyright. In response,
training data detection has emerged as a critical task for identifying
unauthorized data usage in model training. To better understand the
vulnerability of autoregressive image generative models to such detection, we
conduct the first study applying membership inference to this domain. Our
approach comprises two key components: implicit classification and an adaptive
score aggregation strategy. First, we compute the implicit token-wise
classification score within the query image. Then we propose an adaptive score
aggregation strategy to acquire a final score, which places greater emphasis on
the tokens with lower scores. A higher final score indicates that the sample is
more likely to be involved in the training set. To validate the effectiveness
of our method, we adapt existing detection algorithms originally designed for
LLMs to visual autoregressive models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method in both class-conditional and text-to-image
scenarios. Moreover, our approach exhibits strong robustness and generalization
under various data transformations. Furthermore, sufficient experiments suggest
two novel key findings: (1) A linear scaling law on membership inference,
exposing the vulnerability of large foundation models. (2) Training data from
scale-wise visual autoregressive models is easier to detect than other
autoregressive paradigms.Our code is available at

Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced
experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often
include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that
can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this,
we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source
separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly
trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical
signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background
contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a
reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or
pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by
considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as
experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a
four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background
contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found
to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or
structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four
dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the
choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a
versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse
domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to
structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.

Abstract: Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for
the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments.
Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories
independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated
vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the
interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent
predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in
their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and
implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work,
we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction,
including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the
model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We
evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and
inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and
limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at

Conclusion: ST-LLM有效提升了MLLMs的全面时空理解能力，为智能体在现实环境中的应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), MLLMs still struggle to correctly answer prompts that require a
holistic spatio-temporal understanding. Specifically, it is challenging to
address prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment that an agent
equipped with an MLLM can operate in; and simultaneously also refer to 2)
recent actions that just happened and are encoded in a video clip. However,
such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating
in the real world. To address this issue, we first develop a framework to
collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about
Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent methods indeed
struggle to correctly answer the prompts. To improve, we develop a
"spatio-temporal LLM" (ST-LLM), a model equipped with projectors to improve
both spatial understanding of an environment and temporal understanding of
recent observations. On the collected REA data, we show that the proposed
method significantly improves results compared to prior work. Code and data are
available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.

Abstract: LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发实用、可扩展且值得信赖的AIGI检测系统奠定了基础，并揭示了效率与性能之间的权衡。

Abstract: The recent proliferation of photorealistic AI-generated images (AIGI) has
raised urgent concerns about their potential misuse, particularly on social
media platforms. Current state-of-the-art AIGI detection methods typically rely
on large, deep neural architectures, creating significant computational
barriers to real-time, large-scale deployment on platforms like social media.
To challenge this reliance on computationally intensive models, we introduce
LAID, the first framework -- to our knowledge -- that benchmarks and evaluates
the detection performance and efficiency of off-the-shelf lightweight neural
networks. In this framework, we comprehensively train and evaluate selected
models on a representative subset of the GenImage dataset across spatial,
spectral, and fusion image domains. Our results demonstrate that lightweight
models can achieve competitive accuracy, even under adversarial conditions,
while incurring substantially lower memory and computation costs compared to
current state-of-the-art methods. This study offers valuable insight into the
trade-off between efficiency and performance in AIGI detection and lays a
foundation for the development of practical, scalable, and trustworthy
detection systems. The source code of LAID can be found at:

Conclusion: VDG-Uni3DSeg提供了一种可扩展且实用的3D理解解决方案。

Abstract: Unified segmentation of 3D point clouds is crucial for scene understanding,
but is hindered by its sparse structure, limited annotations, and the challenge
of distinguishing fine-grained object classes in complex environments. Existing
methods often struggle to capture rich semantic and contextual information due
to limited supervision and a lack of diverse multimodal cues, leading to
suboptimal differentiation of classes and instances. To address these
challenges, we propose VDG-Uni3DSeg, a novel framework that integrates
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) and large language models
(LLMs) to enhance 3D segmentation. By leveraging LLM-generated textual
descriptions and reference images from the internet, our method incorporates
rich multimodal cues, facilitating fine-grained class and instance separation.
We further design a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Loss to align point features
with multimodal queries and a Spatial Enhanced Module to model scene-wide
relationships efficiently. Operating within a closed-set paradigm that utilizes
multimodal knowledge generated offline, VDG-Uni3DSeg achieves state-of-the-art
results in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, offering a scalable
and practical solution for 3D understanding. Our code is available at

Conclusion: CTA为测试时间训练提供了一种高效且通用的方法，无需专门模型结构即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide
range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance often degrades
significantly when faced with distribution shifts, such as domain or dataset
changes. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as an effective method to enhance
model robustness by incorporating an auxiliary unsupervised task during
training and leveraging it for model updates at test time. In this work, we
introduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.
Unlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model
architecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal
contrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.
This process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both
models, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the
intrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically
meaningful updates at test-time. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in robustness and generalization over the state-of-the-art on
several benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 神经调节物质驱动的短暂增益脉冲可作为自适应双时间尺度优化机制，有效调节突触权重更新。

Abstract: Biological and artificial learning systems alike confront the
plasticity-stability dilemma. In the brain, neuromodulators such as
acetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain
and inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed
by dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal
system, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant
substrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals
coincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a
single somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts
the output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that
translate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this
mechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons
and single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,
linked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).
The soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,
while dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by
shifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive
or tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of
calcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition
suppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold
of neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting
accelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and
flexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators
could serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively
modulating the synaptic weight updates.

Conclusion: LILITH为意识研究提供了新方法，但实现仍需克服挑战。

Abstract: Current paradigms in Artificial Intelligence rely on layers of feedforward
networks which model brain activity at the neuronal level. We conjecture that
expanding to the level of multiple brain regions with chemical signaling may be
a productive step toward understanding the emergence of consciousness. We
propose LILITH, a novel architecture that combines developmental training of
modular language models with brain-inspired token-based communication
protocols, mirroring chemical signaling in the brain. Our approach models
distinct brain regions as specialized LLM modules including thinking, memory,
sensory, and regulatory components that communicate through emergent
token-based signaling protocols analogous to neurotransmitter networks. Unlike
traditional pre-trained systems, LILITH would employ developmental training
where untrained LLM architectures learn through simulated life experiences,
developing communication pathways and cognitive abilities through environmental
interaction and evolutionary optimization. This framework would enable direct
empirical investigation of consciousness emergence using Integrated Information
Theory metrics while providing unprecedented insight into inter-module
signaling patterns during development. By optimizing for consciousness
emergence rather than task performance, LILITH could provide insight into
different emergent phenomena at multiple levels of neural correlates,
contrasting neuronal-level processing with multi-region coordination dynamics.
The goal of this paper is to put the idea forward while recognizing the
substantial challenges in implementing such a system.

also tackle three concrete challenges. First, we consider the process of
information propagation through a neural network, i.e., we study the
input-output map for different architectures. We explain the universal
embedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions
of given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural
ODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural
delay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks
dynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent
and study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis
to the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon,
also in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias. For stochastic
gradient descent, we present stability results for the overparameterized
setting via Lyapunov exponents of interpolation solutions. Third, we explain
several results regarding mean-field limits of neural networks. We describe a
result that extends existing techniques to heterogeneous neural networks
involving graph limits via digraph measures. This shows how large classes of
neural networks naturally fall within the framework of Kuramoto-type models on
graphs and their large-graph limits. Finally, we point out that similar
strategies to use dynamics to study explainable and reliable AI can also be
applied to settings such as generative models or fundamental issues in gradient
training methods, such as backpropagation or vanishing/exploding gradients.

### [654] [LLM4Hint: Leveraging Large Language Models for Hint Recommendation in Offline Query Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03384)
*Suchen Liu,Jun Gao,Yinjun Han,Yang Lin*

Key words: SQL查询优化, 大型语言模型, 学习型优化器, LLM4Hint, 泛化能力

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何利用大型语言模型（LLM）提升SQL查询优化器的泛化能力，并提出LLM4Hint方法，通过轻量级模型和LLM的结合，优化查询提示生成，实验显示其优于现有学习型优化器。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.DB

Motivation: 传统SQL查询优化器难以应对复杂工作负载，而基于学习的方法泛化能力有限。LLM在多任务上的成功启发了利用其提升优化器泛化能力的探索。

Method: 提出LLM4Hint方法：结合轻量级模型生成软提示以减少LLM输入长度，使用大型商业LLM简化SQL语义，并引入显式匹配提示加速模型收敛。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4Hint通过LLM更强的查询理解能力，在效果和泛化性上优于现有学习型优化器。

Conclusion: LLM4Hint为SQL查询优化提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS,
and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances
in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome
hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face
limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large
Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how
LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.
Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly
including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost
and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token
sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical
features.
  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to
alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint}
that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization
hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model
to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the
SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously
reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting
strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the
backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit
matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight
model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show
that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the
query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in
terms of both effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: IOLM-DB 是一种新型系统，通过查询特定的模型优化，使基于 LLM 增强的数据库查询变得实用，显著降低了计算和内存成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.DB

Motivation: LLM 在数据摘要、清洗和语义转换方面能力强大，但大规模部署时计算和内存成本过高，限制了其实际应用。

Method: IOLM-DB 为每个查询生成轻量级、专用化的模型，采用量化、稀疏化和结构剪枝等压缩技术。

Result: IOLM-DB 将模型占用空间减少 76%，吞吐量提升 3.31 倍，并保持准确性。

Conclusion: IOLM-DB 证明在大规模分析系统中使用 LLM 查询是可行的，为未来 OLAP 应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance analytics systems with powerful data
summarization, cleaning, and semantic transformation capabilities. However,
deploying LLMs at scale -- processing millions to billions of rows -- remains
prohibitively expensive in computation and memory. We present IOLM-DB, a novel
system that makes LLM-enhanced database queries practical through
query-specific model optimization. Instead of using general-purpose LLMs,
IOLM-DB generates lightweight, specialized models tailored to each query's
specific needs using representative data samples. IOLM-DB reduces model
footprints by up to 76% and increases throughput by up to 3.31$\times$ while
maintaining accuracy through aggressive compression techniques, including
quantization, sparsification, and structural pruning. We further show how our
approach enables higher parallelism on existing hardware and seamlessly
supports caching and batching strategies to reduce overheads. Our prototype
demonstrates that leveraging LLM queries inside analytics systems is feasible
at scale, opening new possibilities for future OLAP applications.

TL;DR: 论文探讨Bittensor是否能被视为去中心化AI领域的比特币，通过比较其代币经济、去中心化特性、共识机制和激励结构，发现其存在质押与奖励集中、激励与贡献不符等问题，并提出多项协议级改进方案。

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 研究Bittensor是否能在去中心化AI领域达到比特币的地位，并解决其代币经济与激励结构中的问题。

Method: 通过链上数据分析了64个活跃Bittensor子网络的质押与奖励分布，并提出协议级干预措施来优化激励和增强安全性。

Result: 发现Bittensor存在质押与奖励过度集中的问题，激励与贡献不符；提出的解决方案（如绩效加权分配、质押上限）能有效改善这些问题。

Conclusion: Bittensor目前存在激励与安全问题，但通过提出的改进措施，可以提升其作为去中心化AI网络的潜力。

Abstract: This paper investigates whether Bittensor can be considered the Bitcoin of
decentralized Artificial Intelligence by directly comparing its tokenomics,
decentralization properties, consensus mechanism, and incentive structure
against those of Bitcoin. Leveraging on-chain data from all 64 active Bittensor
subnets, we first document considerable concentration in both stake and
rewards. We further show that rewards are overwhelmingly driven by stake,
highlighting a clear misalignment between quality and compensation. As a
remedy, we put forward a series of two-pronged protocol-level interventions.
For incentive realignment, our proposed solutions include performance-weighted
emission split, composite scoring, and a trust-bonus multiplier. As for
mitigating security vulnerability due to stake concentration, we propose and
empirically validate stake cap at the 88th percentile, which elevates the
median coalition size required for a 51-percent attack and remains robust
across daily, weekly, and monthly snapshots.

Motivation: 探讨多轮越狱攻击对LLMs安全的威胁，揭示现有单轮防御措施的局限性。

Method: 通过分析Crescendo多轮越狱攻击对模型中间表示的影响，研究其绕过安全对齐的机制。

Result: 研究发现，随着对话轮次增加，模型倾向于将Crescendo响应误判为良性攻击。单轮防御对此类攻击无效。

Conclusion: 多轮越狱攻击暴露了现有防御措施在通用性上的不足，需开发针对性更强的缓解方案。

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that state-of-the-art LLMs and defenses
remain susceptible to multi-turn jailbreak attacks. These attacks require only
closed-box model access and are often easy to perform manually, posing a
significant threat to the safe and secure deployment of LLM-based systems. We
study the effectiveness of the Crescendo multi-turn jailbreak at the level of
intermediate model representations and find that safety-aligned LMs often
represent Crescendo responses as more benign than harmful, especially as the
number of conversation turns increases. Our analysis indicates that at each
turn, Crescendo prompts tend to keep model outputs in a "benign" region of
representation space, effectively tricking the model into fulfilling harmful
requests. Further, our results help explain why single-turn jailbreak defenses
like circuit breakers are generally ineffective against multi-turn attacks,
motivating the development of mitigations that address this generalization gap.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 降低标记样本成本，利用贝叶斯理论提供深度神经网络的概率视角。

Method: 1. Inception-V4+PCA结合多种SVM算法；2. 提出ViT-BNN作为新型主动学习方法。

Result: ViT-BNN在处理不确定性上更稳定和鲁棒。

Conclusion: ViT-BNN是先进且通用的主动学习方法。

Abstract: Active learning for classification seeks to reduce the cost of labeling
samples by finding unlabeled examples about which the current model is least
certain and sending them to an annotator/expert to label. Bayesian theory can
provide a probabilistic view of deep neural network models by asserting a prior
distribution over model parameters and estimating the uncertainties by
posterior distribution over these parameters. This paper proposes two novel
active learning approaches to label one million malware examples belonging to
different unknown modern malware families. The first model is Inception-V4+PCA
combined with several support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (UTSVM, PSVM,
SVM-GSU, TBSVM). The second model is Vision Transformer based Bayesian Neural
Networks ViT-BNN. Our proposed ViT-BNN is a state-of-the-art active learning
approach that differs from current methods and can apply to any particular
task. The experiments demonstrate that the ViT-BNN is more stable and robust in
handling uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 隐私政策文档通常冗长复杂，普通用户难以理解，缺乏透明度，导致对个人数据处理的不信任。本研究旨在开发自动化工具，帮助用户更好地理解隐私政策。

Method: 通过交互式图可视化将隐私政策条款表示为结构化图模型，并结合图挖掘算法（如t-SNE和PCA）识别关键主题。

Result: 基于图的聚类方法提高了隐私政策内容的可解释性，揭示了用户跟踪和数据共享的模式，有助于法医调查和识别监管违规行为。

Conclusion: 本研究通过结合交互式可视化和图挖掘技术，推动了AI驱动的隐私政策审核工具的发展，增强了透明度和信任。

Abstract: Privacy policy documents are often lengthy, complex, and difficult for
non-expert users to interpret, leading to a lack of transparency regarding the
collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. As concerns over online
privacy grow, it is essential to develop automated tools capable of analyzing
privacy policies and identifying potential risks. In this study, we explore the
potential of interactive graph visualizations to enhance user understanding of
privacy policies by representing policy terms as structured graph models. This
approach makes complex relationships more accessible and enables users to make
informed decisions about their personal data (RQ1). We also employ graph mining
algorithms to identify key themes, such as User Activity and Device
Information, using dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and PCA to
assess clustering effectiveness. Our findings reveal that graph-based
clustering improves policy content interpretability. It highlights patterns in
user tracking and data sharing, which supports forensic investigations and
identifies regulatory non-compliance. This research advances AI-driven tools
for auditing privacy policies by integrating interactive visualizations with
graph mining. Enhanced transparency fosters accountability and trust.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 随着LLM训练成本增加和模型重用普遍化，版权和知识产权保护成为重要挑战。现有水印技术在持续训练和开发中不够鲁棒，迫切需要新的方法来保护模型所有权。

Method: 利用注意力参数矩阵的标准差分布作为模型指纹，这些分布特征在不同层中表现出独特且稳定的模式，即使在持续训练后仍能保持鲁棒性。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法能可靠识别模型来源，并成功揭露华为的Pangu Pro MoE模型是基于Qwen-2.5 14B模型通过升级技术而非从头训练开发的。

Conclusion: 本研究的指纹方法为LLM的知识产权保护提供了有效工具，同时表明持续的刻意训练不足以完全掩盖模型来源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant copyright and intellectual
property challenges as the cost of training increases and model reuse becomes
prevalent. While watermarking techniques have been proposed to protect model
ownership, they may not be robust to continue training and development, posing
serious threats to model attribution and copyright protection. This work
introduces a simple yet effective approach for robust LLM fingerprinting based
on intrinsic model characteristics. We discover that the standard deviation
distributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit
distinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued
training. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints
that can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright
infringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication. Notably,
our investigation uncovers evidence that a recently Pangu Pro MoE model
released by Huawei is derived from Qwen-2.5 14B model through upcycling
techniques rather than training from scratch, highlighting potential cases of
model plagiarism, copyright violation, and information fabrication. These
findings underscore the critical importance of developing robust fingerprinting
methods for protecting intellectual property in large-scale model development
and emphasize that deliberate continued training alone is insufficient to
completely obscure model origins.

Abstract: Improving and understanding the training dynamics and reasoning of Large
Language Models (LLMs) has become essential for their deployment in AI-based
security tools, such as software vulnerability detection. In this work, we
present an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning
techniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.
  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as
their tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing
to detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for
guiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its
application to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage
functions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the
field, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.
  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing
multiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization,
reasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised
finetuning (SFT). Our findings offer valuable insights into the potential of
RL-based training to enhance both the performance and reasoning abilities of
LLMs in the context of software vulnerability detection.

Motivation: 解决瞬态 IoT 环境中非专家用户难以手动实现细粒度访问控制策略的问题，同时应对设备异构性和运行时自动配置的挑战。

Method: 采用 LLM 驱动的方法将用户高级意图转化为访问控制策略，结合基于能力的授权和轻量级代理实现策略执行。

Conclusion: CollabIoT 显著提升了 IoT 设备协作的安全性和效率，适用于瞬态环境。

Abstract: Today's Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved from simple sensing and
actuation devices to those with embedded processing and intelligent services,
enabling rich collaborations between users and their devices. However, enabling
such collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact
with host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,
fine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure
interactions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for
non-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically
configure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.
Additionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.
  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and
seamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs
a Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level
intents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless
device collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for
authorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing
hardware-independent abstractions.
  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto
configuration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in
large-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation
pipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%
accuracy. At runtime, our evaluation shows that our system configures new
devices in ~150 ms, and our proxy-based data plane incurs network overheads of
up to 2 ms and access control overheads up to 0.3 ms.

Result: 实验表明注意力锐化能有效抵抗多种越狱攻击，且在良性任务上保持性能，无额外计算或内存开销。

Conclusion: 注意力锐化是一种高效实用的防御方法，可直接应对注意力分散现象。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and
technology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit
vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.
However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this
paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:
Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the
attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack
process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is
consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token
replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.
Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token
Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention
Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of
mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,
a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the
attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four
leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)
show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while
maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention
Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it
an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.

Result: FP8模型表现较强抵抗力，但通过后攻击量化仍存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 量化提升攻击难度，但需注意后攻击量化的安全风险。

Abstract: The safety alignment of Language Models (LMs) is a critical concern, yet
their integrity can be challenged by direct parameter manipulation attacks,
such as those potentially induced by fault injection. As LMs are increasingly
deployed using low-precision quantization for efficiency, this paper
investigates the efficacy of such attacks for jailbreaking aligned LMs across
different quantization schemes. We propose gradient-guided attacks, including a
tailored progressive bit-level search algorithm introduced herein and a
comparative word-level (single weight update) attack. Our evaluation on
Llama-3.2-3B, Phi-4-mini, and Llama-3-8B across FP16 (baseline), and
weight-only quantization (FP8, INT8, INT4) reveals that quantization
significantly influences attack success. While attacks readily achieve high
success (>80\% Attack Success Rate, ASR) on FP16 models, within an attack
budget of 25 perturbations, FP8 and INT8 models exhibit ASRs below 20\% and
50\%, respectively. Increasing the perturbation budget up to 150 bit-flips, FP8
models maintained ASR below 65\%, demonstrating some resilience compared to
INT8 and INT4 models that have high ASR. In addition, analysis of perturbation
locations revealed differing architectural targets across quantization schemes,
with (FP16, INT4) and (INT8, FP8) showing similar characteristics. Besides,
jailbreaks induced in FP16 models were highly transferable to subsequent
FP8/INT8 quantization (<5\% ASR difference), though INT4 significantly reduced
transferred ASR (avg. 35\% drop). These findings highlight that while common
quantization schemes, particularly FP8, increase the difficulty of direct
parameter manipulation jailbreaks, vulnerabilities can still persist,
especially through post-attack quantization.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in designing powerful adversarial evasion
attacks for robustness verification, the evaluation of these methods often
remains inconsistent and unreliable. Many assessments rely on mismatched
models, unverified implementations, and uneven computational budgets, which can
lead to biased results and a false sense of security. Consequently, robustness
claims built on such flawed testing protocols may be misleading and give a
false sense of security. As a concrete step toward improving evaluation
reliability, we present AttackBench, a benchmark framework developed to assess
the effectiveness of gradient-based attacks under standardized and reproducible
conditions. AttackBench serves as an evaluation tool that ranks existing attack
implementations based on a novel optimality metric, which enables researchers

Key words: LLM, 代码安全, 代理框架, 漏洞分析, 软件开发

TL;DR: 本文首次大规模分析了LLM生成的补丁的安全性，发现LLM引入的漏洞比开发者多9倍，且代理框架在高自主性时也易生成漏洞。情境因素对代码安全性至关重要。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 评估LLM及其代理框架在真实开发环境中生成补丁的安全性，填补现有研究在合成或孤立环境中的不足。

Method: 使用SWE-bench数据集的20,000+问题，评估独立LLM（Llama 3.3）和三个代理框架生成的补丁，并与开发者补丁对比。

Result: 独立LLM引入的漏洞比开发者多9倍；代理框架在高自主性时易生成漏洞；漏洞多与多文件、多代码行及缺乏明确上下文的GitHub问题相关。

Conclusion: 情境因素是生成代码安全性的关键，需结合代码和问题信息进行主动风险评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly
adopted to automate software development tasks such as issue resolution and
program repair. While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated
code, most evaluations have focused on synthetic or isolated settings, leaving
open questions about the security of these systems in real-world development
contexts. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of
LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ issues from the SWE-bench dataset. We
evaluate patches produced by a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3) and compare them to
developer-written patches. We also assess the security of patches generated by
three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb)
on a subset of our data. Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and
project-level factors to understand the conditions under which LLMs and agents
are most likely to generate insecure code. Our findings reveal that the
standalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers,
with many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code.
Agentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities,
particularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the
likelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find
that vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a
higher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that
lack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and
steps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a
critical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need
for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and
issue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.

Key words: 恶意软件家族分类, 大型语言模型, 检索增强生成, 家族特定字符串特征

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在大型语言模型和检索增强生成时代，利用传统的二进制字符串特征进行恶意软件家族分类的可行性，重点研究了家族特定字符串特征的应用。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 自动化样本标签和理解的准确性对恶意软件分析平台至关重要，而传统方法难以处理大量数据。

Method: 开发了一个评估框架，覆盖了67个恶意软件家族的4347个样本，提取并分析了2500多万个字符串，并对四个主要模块进行了详细消融研究。

Result: 研究表明家族特定字符串特征可以在恶意软件家族分类中发挥作用。

Conclusion: 二进制字符串特征在恶意软件家族分类中仍具有潜力，尤其是在结合现代技术时。

Abstract: Malware Family Classification (MFC) aims to identify the fine-grained family
(e.g., GuLoader or BitRAT) to which a potential malware sample belongs, in
contrast to malware detection or sample classification that predicts only an
Yes/No. Accurate family identification can greatly facilitate automated sample
labeling and understanding on crowdsourced malware analysis platforms such as
VirusTotal and MalwareBazaar, which generate vast amounts of data daily. In
this paper, we explore and assess the feasibility of using traditional binary
string features for MFC in the new era of large language models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, we investigate how
Family-Specific String (FSS) features could be utilized in a manner similar to
RAG to facilitate MFC. To this end, we develop a curated evaluation framework
covering 4,347 samples from 67 malware families, extract and analyze over 25
million strings, and conduct detailed ablation studies to assess the impact of
different design choices in four major modules.

TL;DR: TwinShield框架解决了在异构TEE和加速器系统中安全运行Transformer推理的问题，实现了对模型和数据的双重保护，显著提升了性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: Transformer模型（如大语言模型）被广泛用于安全关键领域，但MLaaS在不可信云基础设施上运行时存在数据泄露风险。现有TEE方案因性能问题难以直接应用于大规模模型。

Method: 提出TwinShield框架，通过混合TEE方案将部分计算卸载到GPU，同时安全处理关键操作（Attention和SoftMax）。

Result: TwinShield将87%的计算卸载到GPU，性能提升4.0x-6.1x。

Conclusion: TwinShield为Transformer推理提供了安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Transformer models, e.g., large language models (LLMs),
have brought tremendous breakthroughs in various artificial intelligence (AI)
tasks, leading to their wide applications in many security-critical domains.
Due to their unprecedented scale and prohibitively high development cost, these
models have become highly valuable intellectual property for AI stakeholders
and are increasingly deployed via machine learning as a service (MLaaS).
However, MLaaS often runs on untrusted cloud infrastructure, exposing data and
models to potential breaches. Mainstream protection mechanisms leverage trusted
execution environments (TEEs) where confidentiality and integrity for secretive
data are shielded using hardware-based encryption and integrity checking.
Unfortunately, running model inference entirely within TEEs is subject to
non-trivial slowdown, which is further exacerbated in LLMs due to the
substantial computation and memory footprint involved. Recent studies reveal
that the hybrid TEE-based scheme offloading partial model inference operations
to the untrusted accelerators (e.g., GPU) is a promising solution. However,
prior offloading schemes fail to ensure dual protection of data and model in
Transformer inference, as they cannot securely offload critical operations,
i.e., Attention and SoftMax, forcing these computations to remain confined
within TEEs. To address these challenges, we propose TwinShield, a framework
enabling secure Transformer inference in heterogeneous TEE and accelerator
systems with dual protection for both model and data. TwinShield offloads ~87%
of computation to GPUs and delivers 4.0x - 6.1x speedups over previous
approaches across various Transformer models.

Method: 研究提出了STP攻击场景，并展示了其对持续学习模型的影响，同时提出了一种基于任务向量的投毒检测方法和防御框架。

Result: 即使敌手条件严格，STP攻击仍能显著破坏模型性能，同时提出了有效的防御措施。

Conclusion: STP攻击对持续学习的稳定性和可塑性具有显著威胁，但可以通过提出的防御框架进行缓解。

Abstract: Our research addresses the overlooked security concerns related to data
poisoning in continual learning (CL). Data poisoning - the intentional
manipulation of training data to affect the predictions of machine learning
models - was recently shown to be a threat to CL training stability. While
existing literature predominantly addresses scenario-dependent attacks, we
propose to focus on a more simple and realistic single-task poison (STP)
threats. In contrast to previously proposed poisoning settings, in STP
adversaries lack knowledge and access to the model, as well as to both previous
and future tasks. During an attack, they only have access to the current task
within the data stream. Our study demonstrates that even within these stringent
conditions, adversaries can compromise model performance using standard image
corruptions. We show that STP attacks are able to strongly disrupt the whole
continual training process: decreasing both the stability (its performance on
past tasks) and plasticity (capacity to adapt to new tasks) of the algorithm.
Finally, we propose a high-level defense framework for CL along with a poison
task detection method based on task vectors. The code is available at
https://github.com/stapaw/STP.git .

Motivation: 研究移动GUI代理在真实场景中屏幕内容被第三方操控时的脆弱性，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出了AgentHazard框架，支持灵活修改屏幕内容，并构建了动态任务执行环境和静态数据集，共计3000多个攻击场景。

Result: 测试了7个常用移动GUI代理和5个骨干模型，发现所有代理均易受攻击（平均误导率28.8%），且其脆弱性与感知模态和骨干LLM相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了移动GUI代理的脆弱性，并评估了训练缓解策略，为提升代理的鲁棒性提供了方向。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are designed to autonomously execute diverse device-control
tasks by interpreting and interacting with mobile screens. Despite notable
advancements, their resilience in real-world scenarios where screen content may
be partially manipulated by untrustworthy third parties remains largely
unexplored. Owing to their black-box and autonomous nature, these agents are
vulnerable to manipulations that could compromise user devices. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the vulnerabilities of
mobile GUI agents. We introduce a scalable attack simulation framework
AgentHazard, which enables flexible and targeted modifications of screen
content within existing applications. Leveraging this framework, we develop a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising both a dynamic task execution
environment and a static dataset of vision-language-action tuples, totaling
over 3,000 attack scenarios. The dynamic environment encompasses 58
reproducible tasks in an emulator with various types of hazardous UI content,
while the static dataset is constructed from 210 screenshots collected from 14
popular commercial apps. Importantly, our content modifications are designed to
be feasible for unprivileged third parties. We evaluate 7 widely-used mobile
GUI agents and 5 common backbone models using our benchmark. Our findings
reveal that all examined agents are significantly influenced by misleading
third-party content (with an average misleading rate of 28.8% in human-crafted
attack scenarios) and that their vulnerabilities are closely linked to the
employed perception modalities and backbone LLMs. Furthermore, we assess
training-based mitigation strategies, highlighting both the challenges and
opportunities for enhancing the robustness of mobile GUI agents. Our code and
data will be released at https://agenthazard.github.io.

Conclusion: 该方法在零日恶意软件检测中表现优异，适用于对抗持续演变的Android威胁。

Abstract: The persistent threat of Android malware presents a serious challenge to the
security of millions of users globally. While many machine learning-based
methods have been developed to detect these threats, their reliance on large
labeled datasets limits their effectiveness against emerging, previously unseen
malware families, for which labeled data is scarce or nonexistent.
  To address this challenge, we introduce a novel zero-shot learning framework
that combines Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (VGAE) with Siamese Neural
Networks (SNN) to identify malware without needing prior examples of specific
malware families. Our approach leverages graph-based representations of Android
applications, enabling the model to detect subtle structural differences
between benign and malicious software, even in the absence of labeled data for
new threats.
  Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
MaMaDroid, especially in zero-day malware detection. Our model achieves 96.24%
accuracy and 95.20% recall for unknown malware families, highlighting its
robustness against evolving Android threats.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality malware datasets that
support advanced analysis techniques, particularly machine learning and agentic
AI frameworks. Existing datasets often lack diversity, comprehensive labelling,
and the complexity necessary for effective machine learning and agent-based AI
training. To fill this gap, we developed a systematic approach for generating a
dataset that combines automated malware execution in controlled virtual
environments with dynamic monitoring tools. The resulting dataset comprises
clean and infected memory snapshots across multiple malware families and
operating systems, capturing detailed behavioural and environmental features.
Key design decisions include applying ethical and legal compliance, thorough
validation using both automated and manual methods, and comprehensive
documentation to ensure replicability and integrity. The dataset's distinctive
features enable modelling system states and transitions, facilitating RL-based
malware detection and response strategies. This resource is significant for
advancing adaptive cybersecurity defences and digital forensic research. Its
scope supports diverse malware scenarios and offers potential for broader
applications in incident response and automated threat mitigation.

Motivation: 为解决现有遗忘方法成本高或缺乏隐私保证的问题，开发了一种高效且具隐私保证的机器学习遗忘框架。

Method: 利用隐私模型（如k-匿名和ε-差分隐私）保护数据预训练模型，实现高效遗忘。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证了EUPG的实用性和遗忘效果，与精确遗忘方法相当，同时显著降低计算和存储成本。

Conclusion: EUPG是一种高效且具隐私保证的机器学习遗忘框架，适用于多种隐私模型。

Abstract: Privacy protection laws, such as the GDPR, grant individuals the right to
request the forgetting of their personal data not only from databases but also
from machine learning (ML) models trained on them. Machine unlearning has
emerged as a practical means to facilitate model forgetting of data instances
seen during training. Although some existing machine unlearning methods
guarantee exact forgetting, they are typically costly in computational terms.
On the other hand, more affordable methods do not offer forgetting guarantees
and are applicable only to specific ML models. In this paper, we present
\emph{efficient unlearning with privacy guarantees} (EUPG), a novel machine
unlearning framework that offers formal privacy guarantees to individuals whose
data are being unlearned. EUPG involves pre-training ML models on data
protected using privacy models, and it enables {\em efficient unlearning with
the privacy guarantees offered by the privacy models in use}. Through empirical
evaluation on four heterogeneous data sets protected with $k$-anonymity and
$\epsilon$-differential privacy as privacy models, our approach demonstrates
utility and forgetting effectiveness comparable to those of exact unlearning
methods, while significantly reducing computational and storage costs. Our code
is available at https://github.com/najeebjebreel/EUPG.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various fields with their
exceptional capabilities in understanding, processing, and generating
human-like text. This paper investigates the potential of LLMs in advancing
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), analyzing current challenges,
methodologies, and future opportunities. It begins by establishing a
foundational understanding of NIDS and LLMs, exploring the enabling
technologies that bridge the gap between intelligent and cognitive systems in
AI-driven NIDS. While Intelligent NIDS leverage machine learning and deep
learning to detect threats based on learned patterns, they often lack
contextual awareness and explainability. In contrast, Cognitive NIDS integrate
LLMs to process both structured and unstructured security data, enabling deeper
contextual reasoning, explainable decision-making, and automated response for
intrusion behaviors. Practical implementations are then detailed, highlighting
LLMs as processors, detectors, and explainers within a comprehensive AI-driven
NIDS pipeline. Furthermore, the concept of an LLM-centered Controller is
proposed, emphasizing its potential to coordinate intrusion detection
workflows, optimizing tool collaboration and system performance. Finally, this
paper identifies critical challenges and opportunities, aiming to foster
innovation in developing reliable, adaptive, and explainable NIDS. By
presenting the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper seeks to inspire
advancement in next-generation network security systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries train their local models on poisoned data and submit poisoned model
updates to compromise the global model. Despite numerous proposed attacks and
defenses, divergent experimental settings, implementation errors, and
unrealistic assumptions hinder fair comparisons and valid conclusions about
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce
BackFed - a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to standardize, streamline,
and reliably evaluate backdoor attacks and defenses in FL, with a focus on
practical constraints. Our benchmark offers key advantages through its
multi-processing implementation that significantly accelerates experimentation
and the modular design that enables seamless integration of new methods via
well-defined APIs. With a standardized evaluation pipeline, we envision BackFed
as a plug-and-play environment for researchers to comprehensively and reliably
evaluate new attacks and defenses. Using BackFed, we conduct large-scale
studies of representative backdoor attacks and defenses across both Computer
Vision and Natural Language Processing tasks with diverse model architectures
and experimental settings. Our experiments critically assess the performance of
proposed attacks and defenses, revealing unknown limitations and modes of
failures under practical conditions. These empirical insights provide valuable
guidance for the development of new methods and for enhancing the security of
FL systems. Our framework is openly available at

Result: 实验显示攻击成功率达74.4%，且能绕过过滤器静默破坏输出完整性。

Conclusion: RAG系统文档加载阶段存在严重安全漏洞，亟需加强防御以抵御隐蔽内容操纵。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-machine interaction since
ChatGPT's 2022 debut, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a
key framework that enhances LLM outputs by integrating external knowledge.
However, RAG's reliance on ingesting external documents introduces new
vulnerabilities. This paper exposes a critical security gap at the data loading
stage, where malicious actors can stealthily corrupt RAG pipelines by
exploiting document ingestion.
  We propose a taxonomy of 9 knowledge-based poisoning attacks and introduce
two novel threat vectors -- Content Obfuscation and Content Injection --
targeting common formats (DOCX, HTML, PDF). Using an automated toolkit
implementing 19 stealthy injection techniques, we test five popular data
loaders, finding a 74.4% attack success rate across 357 scenarios. We further
validate these threats on six end-to-end RAG systems -- including white-box
pipelines and black-box services like NotebookLM and OpenAI Assistants --
demonstrating high success rates and critical vulnerabilities that bypass
filters and silently compromise output integrity. Our results emphasize the
urgent need to secure the document ingestion process in RAG systems against
covert content manipulations.

Abstract: The high computational cost and power consumption of current and anticipated
AI systems present a major challenge for widespread deployment and further
scaling. Current hardware approaches face fundamental efficiency limits. This
paper introduces ZettaLith, a scalable computing architecture designed to
reduce the cost and power of AI inference by over 1,000x compared to current
GPU-based systems. Based on architectural analysis and technology projections,
a single ZettaLith rack could potentially achieve 1.507 zettaFLOPS in 2027 -
representing a theoretical 1,047x improvement in inference performance, 1,490x
better power efficiency, and could be 2,325x more cost-effective than current
leading GPU racks for FP4 transformer inference. The ZettaLith architecture
achieves these gains by abandoning general purpose GPU applications, and via
the multiplicative effect of numerous co-designed architectural innovations
using established digital electronic technologies, as detailed in this paper.
ZettaLith's core architectural principles scale down efficiently to exaFLOPS
desktop systems and petaFLOPS mobile chips, maintaining their roughly 1,000x
advantage. ZettaLith presents a simpler system architecture compared to the
complex hierarchy of current GPU clusters. ZettaLith is optimized exclusively

Motivation: 现有PEFT框架在多适配器场景下存在GPU资源浪费、灵活性不足和隐私问题，Symbiosis旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: Symbiosis采用分步执行技术，将客户端适配器与冻结的基础模型层解耦，实现资源共享和多任务并行。

Result: 在Llama2-13B上的实验表明，Symbiosis能够在相同GPU上同时微调4倍多的适配器。

Conclusion: Symbiosis提供了一种高效、灵活且隐私友好的PEFT部署方案，适用于多任务场景。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the
task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the
original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to
creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or
fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,
each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in
excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular
inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow
independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They
cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and
fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to
expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we
address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.
The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning
processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of
client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering
them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method,
to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and
works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our
evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can
fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Method: 引入TopoMAS框架，结合用户查询、多源数据、理论推断和动态知识图，实现材料的自动化发现与验证。

Result: TopoMAS成功识别出新拓扑相SrSbO3，并在轻量级模型Qwen2.5-72B上达到94.55%准确率，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: TopoMAS不仅加速了拓扑材料发现，还为材料科学领域提供了可扩展的范例。

Abstract: Topological materials occupy a frontier in condensed-matter physics thanks to
their remarkable electronic and quantum properties, yet their cross-scale
design remains bottlenecked by inefficient discovery workflows. Here, we
introduce TopoMAS (Topological materials Multi-Agent System), an interactive
human-AI framework that seamlessly orchestrates the entire materials-discovery
pipeline: from user-defined queries and multi-source data retrieval, through
theoretical inference and crystal-structure generation, to first-principles
validation. Crucially, TopoMAS closes the loop by autonomously integrating
computational outcomes into a dynamic knowledge graph, enabling continuous
knowledge refinement. In collaboration with human experts, it has already
guided the identification of novel topological phases SrSbO3, confirmed by
first-principles calculations. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate robust
adaptability across base Large Language Model, with the lightweight Qwen2.5-72B
model achieving 94.55% accuracy while consuming only 74.3-78.4% of tokens
required by Qwen3-235B and 83.0% of DeepSeek-V3's usage--delivering responses
twice as fast as Qwen3-235B. This efficiency establishes TopoMAS as an
accelerator for computation-driven discovery pipelines. By harmonizing rational
agent orchestration with a self-evolving knowledge graph, our framework not
only delivers immediate advances in topological materials but also establishes
a transferable, extensible paradigm for materials-science domain.

Main category: math.OC

Motivation: 现代交通网络建模需要整合传统上孤立发展的多种方法（如传感器预测、强化学习、流优化和需求建模），以实现更高效的交通系统。

Method: 采用张量计算图架构，连接交通流、路径概率和链路旅行时间，并通过张量分解技术确保计算可行性。

Result: FTT框架实现了实时控制策略、多交通模式协调以及物理网络约束的严格执行。

Conclusion: FTT为下一代综合交通系统提供了理论基础和实际部署支持。

Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration
of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement
learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have
traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through
Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin
destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected
tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a
consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization
across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports
multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups
with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor
decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large
scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control
strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and
operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT
framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and
practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation
integrated mobility systems.

Result: 生成的实例能够根据病房特性（如患者年龄和住院时间分布）灵活调整，提高了实用性。

Conclusion: 该工具为研究PRA问题提供了可重现且接近现实的测试数据。

Abstract: Developing algorithms for real-life problems that perform well in practice
highly depends on the availability of realistic data for testing. Obtaining
real-life data for optimization problems in health care, however, is often
difficult. This is especially true for any patient related optimization
problems, e.g., for patient-to-room assignment, due to data privacy policies.
Furthermore, obtained real-life data usually cannot be published which
prohibits reproducibility of results by other researchers. Therefore, often
artificially generated instances are used. In this paper, we present
combinatorial insights about the feasibility of instances for the
patient-to-room assignment problem (PRA). We use these insights to develop a
configurable instance generator for PRA with an easy-to-use graphical user
interface. Configurability is in this case especially important as we observed
in an extensive analysis of real-life data that, e.g., the probability
distribution for patients' age and length of stay depends on the respective
ward.

Motivation: 在信息有限的环境中，如何有效管理在线凸优化中的切换成本是一个关键问题。

Method: 在每次动作选择前，仅基于前一动作为当前或最近成本函数提供单次函数评估和梯度，设计了在线算法。

Result: 在线性切换成本下，算法实现了最优竞争比；在梯度信息有噪声时，竞争比随噪声幅度呈二次增长。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法在信息有限和噪声条件下仍能有效管理切换成本。

Abstract: Online convex optimization with switching cost is considered under the frugal
information setting where at time $t$, before action $x_t$ is taken, only a
single function evaluation and a single gradient is available at the previously
chosen action $x_{t-1}$ for either the current cost function $f_t$ or the most
recent cost function $f_{t-1}$. When the switching cost is linear, online
algorithms with optimal order-wise competitive ratios are derived for the
frugal setting. When the gradient information is noisy, an online algorithm
whose competitive ratio grows quadratically with the noise magnitude is
derived.

Abstract: Research, innovation and practical capital investment have been increasing
rapidly toward the realization of autonomous physical agents. This includes
industrial and service robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, embedded control
devices, and a number of other realizations of cybernetic/mechatronic
implementations of intelligent autonomous devices. In this paper, we consider a
stylized version of robotic care, which would normally involve a two-level
Reinforcement Learning procedure that trains a policy for both lower level
physical movement decisions as well as higher level conceptual tasks and their
sub-components. In order to deliver greater safety and reliability in the
system, we present the general formulation of this as a two-level optimization
scheme which incorporates control at the lower level, and classical planning at
the higher level, integrated with a capacity for learning. This synergistic
integration of multiple methodologies -- control, classical planning, and RL --
presents an opportunity for greater insight for algorithm development, leading
to more efficient and reliable performance. Here, the notion of reliability
pertains to physical safety and interpretability into an otherwise black box
operation of autonomous agents, concerning users and regulators. This work
presents the necessary background and general formulation of the optimization
framework, detailing each component and its integration with the others.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a mutual information optimal control problem
(MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems. This problem can be regarded as an
extension of a maximum entropy optimal control problem (MEOCP). Differently
from the MEOCP where the prior is fixed to the uniform distribution, the MIOCP
optimizes the policy and prior simultaneously. As analytical results, under the
policy and prior classes consisting of Gaussian distributions, we derive the
optimal policy and prior of the MIOCP with the prior and policy fixed,
respectively. Using the results, we propose an alternating minimization
algorithm for the MIOCP. Through numerical experiments, we discuss how our
proposed algorithm works.

Conclusion: 无人机结合深度强化学习能有效提升物联网设备认证的效率和网络性能。

Abstract: Devices operating in Internet of Things (IoT) networks may be deployed across
vast geographical areas and interconnected via multi-hop communications.
Further, they may be unguarded. This makes them vulnerable to attacks and
motivates operators to check on devices frequently. To this end, we propose and
study an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided attestation framework for use in
IoT networks with a charging station powered by solar. A key challenge is
optimizing the trajectory of the UAV to ensure it attests as many devices as
possible. A trade-off here is that devices being checked by the UAV are
offline, which affects the amount of data delivered to a gateway. Another
challenge is that the charging station experiences time-varying energy
arrivals, which in turn affect the flight duration and charging schedule of the
UAV. To address these challenges, we employ a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
solution to optimize the UAV's charging schedule and the selection of devices
to be attested during each flight. The simulation results show that our
solution reduces the average age of trust by 88% and throughput loss due to
attestation by 30%.

Result: 实验表明该方法在精度和资源利用上优于现有量子特征映射，并在噪声环境下表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子机器学习在近未来量子计算平台上的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional
data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional quantum kernels, or
feature maps, for encoding data features onto a quantum circuit are currently
impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the
dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a
quantum kernel designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly
reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves
essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as
evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a
marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization, as compared to
state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulations results combined
with lower resource requirements highlight our kernel's ability to function
within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through
numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting
circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on
par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. Our
findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum
machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.

Conclusion: 量子方法在BwK问题中展现出显著优势，为运筹学提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines
aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical
algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret
bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In
this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum
computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via
quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent
regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we
demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a
factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget
constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of
a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent
setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear
programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of
the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time
complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared
to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is
the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed
light on operations research.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction have achieved near-atomic
accuracy for well-folded proteins. However, current benchmarks inadequately
assess model performance in biologically challenging contexts, especially those
involving intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), limiting their utility in
applications such as drug discovery, disease variant interpretation, and
protein interface design. We introduce DisProtBench, a comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating protein structure prediction models (PSPMs) under structural
disorder and complex biological conditions. DisProtBench spans three key axes:
(1) Data complexity, covering disordered regions, G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) ligand pairs, and multimeric complexes; (2) Task diversity, benchmarking
twelve leading PSPMs across structure-based tasks with unified classification,
regression, and interface metrics; and (3) Interpretability, via the
DisProtBench Portal, which provides precomputed 3D structures and visual error
analyses. Our results reveal significant variability in model robustness under
disorder, with low-confidence regions linked to functional prediction failures.
Notably, global accuracy metrics often fail to predict task performance in
disordered settings, emphasizing the need for function-aware evaluation.
DisProtBench establishes a reproducible, extensible, and biologically grounded
framework for assessing next-generation PSPMs in realistic biomedical
scenarios.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI search engines is disrupting traditional SEO, with
Gartner predicting 25% reduction in conventional search usage by 2026. This
necessitates new approaches for web content visibility in AI-driven search
environments. We present a domain-specific fine-tuning approach for Generative
Engine Optimization (GEO) that transforms web content to improve
discoverability in large language model outputs. Our method fine-tunes a
BART-base transformer on synthetically generated training data comprising 1,905
cleaned travel website content pairs. Each pair consists of raw website text
and its GEO-optimized counterpart incorporating credible citations, statistical
evidence, and improved linguistic fluency. We evaluate using intrinsic metrics
(ROUGE-L, BLEU) and extrinsic visibility assessments through controlled
experiments with Llama-3.3-70B. The fine-tuned model achieves significant
improvements over baseline BART: ROUGE-L scores of 0.249 (vs. 0.226) and BLEU
scores of 0.200 (vs. 0.173). Most importantly, optimized content demonstrates
substantial visibility gains in generative search responses with 15.63%
improvement in absolute word count and 30.96% improvement in position-adjusted
word count metrics. This work provides the first empirical demonstration that
targeted transformer fine-tuning can effectively enhance web content visibility
in generative search engines with modest computational resources. Our results
suggest GEO represents a tractable approach for content optimization in the
AI-driven search landscape, offering concrete evidence that small-scale,
domain-focused fine-tuning yields meaningful improvements in content
discoverability.

Conclusion: LILI聚类是一种高效且准确的因果推断方法，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Causal forest methods are powerful tools in causal inference. Similar to
traditional random forest in machine learning, causal forest independently
considers each causal tree. However, this independence consideration increases
the likelihood that classification errors in one tree are repeated in others,
potentially leading to significant bias in causal e ect estimation. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach that establishes connections between causal
trees through the Limit Inferior Leaf Interval (LILI) clustering algorithm.
LILIs are constructed based on the leaves of all causal trees, emphasizing the
similarity of dataset confounders. When two instances with di erent treatments
are grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they
are treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering
mechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree
methods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect
(ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal
inference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by
relating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set
theory. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the convergence of the estimated
ATE using LILI clustering. Empirically, extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of LILI clustering.

Method: 提出QR-learner方法，并引入一种结合试验专用CATE学习器的程序，以提升CATE估计的准确性和统计功效。

Result: 模拟研究和实际数据集的应用显示，该方法在CATE估计和检测异质性效应方面均有改进。

Conclusion: QR-learner能有效提升临床试验中的个性化决策能力，尤其在处理外部数据不一致时仍表现稳健。

Abstract: Randomized trials are typically designed to detect average treatment effects
but often lack the statistical power to uncover effect heterogeneity over
patient characteristics, limiting their value for personalized decision-making.
To address this, we propose the QR-learner, a model-agnostic learner that
estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATE) within the trial
population by leveraging external data from other trials or observational
studies. The proposed method is robust: it has the potential to reduce the CATE
prediction mean squared error while maintaining consistency, even when the
external data is not aligned with the trial. Moreover, we introduce a procedure
that combines the QR-learner with a trial-only CATE learner and show that it
asymptotically matches or exceeds the trial-only learner in terms of mean
squared error. We examine the performance of our approach in simulation studies
and apply the methods to a real-world dataset, demonstrating improvements in
both CATE estimation and statistical power for detecting heterogeneous effects.

Conclusion: 研究为STL提供了一种高效的优化方法，能够动态调整源数据的使用，避免负迁移。

Abstract: Theoretical works on supervised transfer learning (STL) -- where the learner
has access to labeled samples from both source and target distributions -- have
for the most part focused on statistical aspects of the problem, while
efficient optimization has received less attention. We consider the problem of
designing an SGD procedure for STL that alternates sampling between source and
target data, while maintaining statistical transfer guarantees without prior
knowledge of the quality of the source data. A main algorithmic difficulty is
in understanding how to design such an adaptive sub-sampling mechanism at each
SGD step, to automatically gain from the source when it is informative, or bias
towards the target and avoid negative transfer when the source is less
informative.
  We show that, such a mixed-sample SGD procedure is feasible for general
prediction tasks with convex losses, rooted in tracking an abstract sequence of
constrained convex programs that serve to maintain the desired transfer
guarantees.
  We instantiate these results in the concrete setting of linear regression
with square loss, and show that the procedure converges, with $1/\sqrt{T}$
rate, to a solution whose statistical performance on the target is adaptive to
the a priori unknown quality of the source. Experiments with synthetic and real
datasets support the theory.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel methodology for robustly estimating particle
size distributions from optical scattering measurements using constrained
Gaussian process regression. The estimation of particle size distributions is
commonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an
ill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise
and limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to
regularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the
Gaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using
a pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent
optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral
expansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace
operator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation
without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary
strategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on
maximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative
approach where the physical constraints are taken into account. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed constrained Gaussian process
regression framework accurately reconstructs particle size distributions,
producing numerically stable, smooth, and physically interpretable results.
This methodology provides a principled and efficient solution for addressing
inverse scattering problems and related ill-posed integral equations.

Abstract: The success of denoising diffusion models raises important questions
regarding their generalisation behaviour, particularly in high-dimensional
settings. Notably, it has been shown that when training and sampling are
performed perfectly, these models memorise training data -- implying that some
form of regularisation is essential for generalisation. Existing theoretical
analyses primarily rely on algorithm-independent techniques such as uniform
convergence, heavily utilising model structure to obtain generalisation bounds.
In this work, we instead leverage the algorithmic aspects that promote
generalisation in diffusion models, developing a general theory of
algorithm-dependent generalisation for this setting. Borrowing from the
framework of algorithmic stability, we introduce the notion of score stability,
which quantifies the sensitivity of score-matching algorithms to dataset
perturbations. We derive generalisation bounds in terms of score stability, and
apply our framework to several fundamental learning settings, identifying
sources of regularisation. In particular, we consider denoising score matching
with early stopping (denoising regularisation), sampler-wide coarse
discretisation (sampler regularisation) and optimising with SGD (optimisation
regularisation). By grounding our analysis in algorithmic properties rather
than model structure, we identify multiple sources of implicit regularisation
unique to diffusion models that have so far been overlooked in the literature.

Result: 在回归和二分类任务中，使用真实数据验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 随机化SINDy算法在动态数据处理中表现良好，具有理论和实践的双重优势。

Abstract: This paper presents ``randomized SINDy", a sequential machine learning
algorithm designed for dynamic data that has a time-dependent structure. It
employs a probabilistic approach, with its PAC learning property rigorously
proven through the mathematical theory of functional analysis. The algorithm
dynamically predicts using a learned probability distribution of predictors,
updating weights via gradient descent and a proximal algorithm to maintain a
valid probability density. Inspired by SINDy (Brunton et al. 2016), it
incorporates feature augmentation and Tikhonov regularization. For multivariate
normal weights, the proximal step is omitted to focus on parameter estimation.
The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental results in
regression and binary classification using real-world data.

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 回顾Breiman关于数据模型与算法模型的经典论述，结合现代计算能力的变化，重新审视其观点，并提出新的方法来达成因果性、简洁性和准确性。

Method: 通过分析Breiman论文中的核心论点，如Rashomon效应和Occam困境，结合现代计算能力和技术，探讨其观点是否依然成立。

Result: 指出Breiman的部分观点（如Occam困境）在现代已不再普遍适用，并提出新的方法可以在不牺牲简洁性的情况下提升准确性。

Conclusion: 现代技术打破了Breiman认为的两者不可兼得的局限，能够更灵活地实现因果分析、简洁性和准确性的目标。

Abstract: In the famous Two Cultures paper, Leo Breiman provided a visionary
perspective on the cultures of ''data models'' (modeling with consideration of
data generation) versus ''algorithmic models'' (vanilla machine learning
models). I provide a modern perspective on these approaches. One of Breiman's
key arguments against data models is the ''Rashomon Effect,'' which is the
existence of many different-but-equally-good models. The Rashomon Effect
implies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated
the data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is
simplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an
accuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has
become clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models
do not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help
explain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to
consider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the
Rashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam
Dilemma. To his credit though, Breiman did not have the benefit of modern
computers, with which my observations are much easier to make.
  Breiman's goal for interpretability was somewhat intertwined with causality:
simpler models can help reveal which variables have a causal relationship with
the outcome. However, I argue that causality can be investigated without the
use of single models, whether or not they are simple. Interpretability is
useful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.
  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two
Cultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,
accuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,
without the limitations Breiman was concerned about.

Conclusion: 论文成功改进了CTMC框架，证明了其在分类数据建模中的有效性，尤其是在语言建模任务中表现突出。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion models excel in modeling continuous distributions,
their application to categorical data has been less effective. Recent work has
shown that ratio-matching through score-entropy within a continuous-time
discrete Markov chain (CTMC) framework serves as a competitive alternative to
autoregressive models in language modeling. To enhance this framework, we first
introduce three new theorems concerning the KL divergence between the data and
learned distribution. Our results serve as the discrete counterpart to those
established for continuous diffusion models and allow us to derive an improved
upper bound of the perplexity. Second, we empirically show that ratio-matching
performed by minimizing the denoising cross-entropy between the clean and
corrupted data enables models to outperform those utilizing score-entropy with
up to 10% lower perplexity/generative-perplexity, and 15% faster training
steps. To further support our findings, we introduce and evaluate a novel CTMC
transition-rate matrix that allows prediction refinement, and derive the
analytic expression for its matrix exponential which facilitates the
computation of conditional ratios thus enabling efficient training and
generation.

Motivation: 现有信息准则（如AIC、BIC）在从大量候选模型中选择最简单的正确模型时存在局限性。

Method: 基于极值理论，提出了PASTIS信息准则，其惩罚项考虑了候选参数库的大小、模型参数数量及显著性阈值。

Result: PASTIS在多个系统（如Lorenz、Ornstein-Uhlenbeck等）中表现出优于AIC、BIC和SINDy的模型识别和预测能力。

Conclusion: PASTIS为随机动力学过程的简单模型发现提供了统计可靠且实用的方法论框架。

Abstract: This thesis focuses on the discovery of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) from noisy and
discrete time series. A major challenge is selecting the simplest possible
correct model from vast libraries of candidate models, where standard
information criteria (AIC, BIC) are often limited.
  We introduce PASTIS (Parsimonious Stochastic Inference), a new information
criterion derived from extreme value theory. Its penalty term, $n_\mathcal{B}
\ln(n_0/p)$, explicitly incorporates the size of the initial library of
candidate parameters ($n_0$), the number of parameters in the considered model
($n_\mathcal{B}$), and a significance threshold ($p$). This significance
threshold represents the probability of selecting a model containing more
parameters than necessary when comparing many models.
  Benchmarks on various systems (Lorenz, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Lotka-Volterra for
SDEs; Gray-Scott for SPDEs) demonstrate that PASTIS outperforms AIC, BIC,
cross-validation (CV), and SINDy (a competing method) in terms of exact model
identification and predictive capability.
  Furthermore, real-world data can be subject to large sampling intervals
($\Delta t$) or measurement noise ($\sigma$), which can impair model learning
and selection capabilities. To address this, we have developed robust variants
of PASTIS, PASTIS-$\Delta t$ and PASTIS-$\sigma$, thus extending the
applicability of the approach to imperfect experimental data.
  PASTIS thus provides a statistically grounded, validated, and practical
methodological framework for discovering simple models for processes with
stochastic dynamics.

Result: 实验验证了理论保证，表明该方法在变量选择和整体奖励上优于多种替代技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为高维动作选择提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has gained widespread adoption in recent
years but faces significant challenges, particularly in unknown and complex
environments. Among these, high-dimensional action selection stands out as a
critical problem. Existing works often require a sophisticated prior design to
eliminate redundancy in the action space, relying heavily on domain expert
experience or involving high computational complexity, which limits their
generalizability across different RL tasks. In this paper, we address these
challenges by proposing a general data-driven action selection approach with
model-free and computationally friendly properties. Our method not only selects
minimal sufficient actions but also controls the false discovery rate via
knockoff sampling. More importantly, we seamlessly integrate the action
selection into deep RL methods during online training. Empirical experiments
validate the established theoretical guarantees, demonstrating that our method
surpasses various alternative techniques in terms of both performance in
variable selection and overall achieved rewards.

Result: 证明CP是UQ机制的结构特性，能够统一多种统计推理方法，且隐私噪声不影响其覆盖性。

Conclusion: CP通过范畴论展现出其在UQ和AI隐私中的重要潜力。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that
delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine
Learning model, yet its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool has
remained conceptually opaque. We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP --
framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined
categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal
assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its UQ capabilities
are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges
(and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic
approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a
conformal prediction region (CPR) is the image of a covariant functor. This
observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added
locally does not break coverage.

Result: 实验表明QMME优于传统一阶和二阶方法，并能高效处理大维度投影矩阵。

Conclusion: QMME在平衡计算成本和收敛速度方面表现优异，适用于大规模核学习问题。

Abstract: First-order methods in convex optimization offer low per-iteration cost but
often suffer from slow convergence, while second-order methods achieve fast
local convergence at the expense of costly Hessian inversions. In this paper,
we highlight a middle ground: minimizing a quadratic majorant with fixed
curvature at each iteration. This strategy strikes a balance between
per-iteration cost and convergence speed, and crucially allows the reuse of
matrix decompositions, such as Cholesky or spectral decompositions, across
iterations and varying regularization parameters. We introduce the Quadratic
Majorization Minimization with Extrapolation (QMME) framework and establish its
sequential convergence properties under standard assumptions. The new
perspective of our analysis is to center the arguments around the induced norm
of the curvature matrix $H$. To demonstrate practical advantages, we apply QMME
to large-scale kernel regularized learning problems. In particular, we propose
a novel Sylvester equation modelling technique for kernel multinomial
regression. In Julia-based experiments, QMME compares favorably against various
established first- and second-order methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
our algorithms complement existing kernel approximation techniques through more
efficiently handling sketching matrices with large projection dimensions. Our
numerical experiments and real data analysis are available and fully
reproducible at https://github.com/qhengncsu/QMME.jl.

Conclusion: 该方法为PSI问题提供了高效解决方案，且理论保证接近最优。

Abstract: We study the Pareto Set Identification (PSI) problem in a structured
multi-output linear bandit model. In this setting, each arm is associated a
feature vector belonging to $\mathbb{R}^h$, and its mean vector in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ linearly depends on this feature vector through a common unknown
matrix $\Theta \in \mathbb{R}^{h \times d}$. The goal is to identify the set of
non-dominated arms by adaptively collecting samples from the arms. We introduce
and analyze the first optimal design-based algorithms for PSI, providing nearly
optimal guarantees in both the fixed-budget and the fixed-confidence settings.
Notably, we show that the difficulty of these tasks mainly depends on the
sub-optimality gaps of $h$ arms only. Our theoretical results are supported by
an extensive benchmark on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: This work aims to estimate the drift and diffusion functions in stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) driven by a particular class of L\'evy processes
with finite jump intensity, using neural networks. We propose a framework that
integrates the Tamed-Milstein scheme with neural networks employed as
non-parametric function approximators. Estimation is carried out in a
non-parametric fashion for the drift function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R}
\), the diffusion coefficient \( g: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{R} \). The model of
interest is given by \[ dX(t) = \xi + f(X(t))\, dt + g(X(t))\, dW_t + \gamma
\int_{\mathbb{Z}} z\, N(dt,dz), \] where \( W_t \) is a standard Brownian
motion, and \( N(dt,dz) \) is a Poisson random measure on \( (~\mathbb{R}_{+}
~\times ~\mathbb{Z}~, ~\mathcal{B}~(~\mathbb{R}_{+}~)~\otimes~\mathcal{Z}~,~
\lambda( \Lambda~\otimes~v~)~) \), with \( \lambda, \gamma > 0 \), \( \Lambda
\) being the Lebesgue measure on \( \mathbb{R}_{+} \), and \( v \) a finite
measure on the measurable space \( (\mathbb{Z}, \mathcal{Z}) \).
  Neural networks are used as non-parametric function approximators, enabling
the modeling of complex nonlinear dynamics without assuming restrictive
functional forms. The proposed methodology constitutes a flexible alternative
for inference in systems with state-dependent noise and discontinuities driven
by L\'evy processes.

Abstract: In decision-making under uncertainty, Contextual Robust Optimization (CRO)
provides reliability by minimizing the worst-case decision loss over a
prediction set, hedging against label variability. While recent advances use
conformal prediction to construct prediction sets for machine learning models,
the downstream decisions critically depend on model selection. This paper
introduces novel model selection frameworks for CRO that unify robustness
control with decision risk minimization. We first propose Conformalized Robust
Optimization with Model Selection (CROMS), which automatically selects models
to approximately minimize the average decision risk in CRO solutions. We
develop two algorithms: E-CROMS, which is computationally efficient, and
F-CROMS, which enjoys a marginal robustness guarantee in finite samples.
Further, we introduce Conformalized Robust Optimization with Individualized
Model Selection (CROiMS), which performs individualized model selection by
minimizing the conditional decision risk given the covariate of test data. This
framework advances conformal prediction methodology by enabling covariate-aware
model selection. Theoretically, CROiMS achieves asymptotic conditional
robustness and decision efficiency under mild assumptions. Numerical results
demonstrate significant improvements in decision efficiency and robustness
across diverse synthetic and real-world applications, outperforming baseline
approaches.

Conclusion: 新方法能够在保持表达性的同时学习解耦潜在结构，具有理论和实际应用价值。

Abstract: In designing generative models, it is commonly believed that in order to
learn useful latent structure, we face a fundamental tension between
expressivity and structure. In this paper we challenge this view by proposing a
new approach to training arbitrarily expressive generative models that
simultaneously learn disentangled latent structure. This is accomplished by
adding a simple decoder-only module to the head of an existing decoder block
that can be arbitrarily complex. The module learns to process concept
information by implicitly inverting linear representations from an encoder.
Inspired by the notion of intervention in causal graphical models, our module
selectively modifies its architecture during training, allowing it to learn a
compact joint model over different contexts. We show how adding this module
leads to disentangled representations that can be composed for
out-of-distribution generation. To further validate our proposed approach, we
prove a new identifiability result that extends existing work on identifying
structured representations in nonlinear models.

Result: 模型在小到中等样本量的数据上表现稳定，能够有效逼近交互作用和抵抗噪声特征，但计算成本较高。

Conclusion: 01Neuro在统计性能和逼近能力上有优势，但计算效率需进一步优化。

Abstract: We propose a new neural network model, 01Neuro, built on indicator activation
neurons. Its boosted variant possesses two key statistical properties: (1) Sure
Convergence, where model optimization can be achieved with high probability
given sufficient computational resources; and (2) Constructive Universal
Approximation: In the infinite sample setting, the model can approximate any
finite sum of measurable functions, each depending on only k out of p input
features, provided the architecture is properly tuned. Unlike most universal
approximation results that are agnostic to training procedures, our guarantees
are directly tied to the model's explicit construction and optimization
algorithm. To improve prediction stability, we integrate stochastic training
and bagging into the boosted 01Neuro framework. Empirical evaluations on
simulated and real-world tabular datasets with small to medium sample sizes
highlight its strengths: effective approximation of interaction components
(multiplicative terms), stable prediction performance (comparable to Random
Forests), robustness to many noisy features, and insensitivity to feature
scaling. A major limitation of the current implementation of boosted 01Neuro is
its higher computational cost, which is approximately 5 to 30 times that of
Random Forests and XGBoost.

Conclusion: VIF方法通过融合两种近似技术的优势，显著提升了高斯过程在大规模数据中的实用性。

Abstract: Gaussian processes are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely
used in machine learning and statistics. However, their scalability to large
data sets is limited by computational constraints. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Vecchia-inducing-points full-scale (VIF) approximations
combining the strengths of global inducing points and local Vecchia
approximations. Vecchia approximations excel in settings with low-dimensional
inputs and moderately smooth covariance functions, while inducing point methods
are better suited to high-dimensional inputs and smoother covariance functions.
Our VIF approach bridges these two regimes by using an efficient
correlation-based neighbor-finding strategy for the Vecchia approximation of
the residual process, implemented via a modified cover tree algorithm. We
further extend our framework to non-Gaussian likelihoods by introducing
iterative methods that substantially reduce computational costs for training
and prediction by several orders of magnitudes compared to Cholesky-based
computations when using a Laplace approximation. In particular, we propose and
compare novel preconditioners and provide theoretical convergence results.
Extensive numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data sets show that
VIF approximations are both computationally efficient as well as more accurate
and numerically stable than state-of-the-art alternatives. All methods are
implemented in the open source C++ library GPBoost with high-level Python and R

Conclusion: 该方法为混沌分析提供了高效且鲁棒的数据驱动方案，适用于时间序列数据的非线性动力学评估。

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a
fundamental challenge in science and engineering. The Lyapunov exponent is a
key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental
data is often hindered by methodological and computational limitations. In this
work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the
positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the
growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence.
Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust,
data-driven alternative to traditional analytic techniques. Through
comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the
logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of
determination R2pos > 0.9 between predicted and theoretical MLE values for time
series as short as M = 200 points. The best accuracy was observed for the
Chebyshev map (R2pos = 0.999). Notably, the proposed method maintains high
computational efficiency and generalizes well across various machine learning
algorithms. These results highlight the significance of our approach for
practical chaos analysis in both synthetic and experimental settings, opening
new possibilities for robust nonlinear dynamics assessment when only time
series data are available.

Main category: q-bio.QM

Motivation: 研究外部扰动（如环境变化、捕食者或通信故障）对群体稳定性的影响，填补了先前研究的空白。

Method: 将群体建模为图，应用图信号处理技术分析扰动；开发SwaGen生成模型，通过定义任务特定损失函数优化群体配置。

Result: 揭示了“可检测性与持久性之间的权衡”，并通过SwaGen生成了优化的群体空间配置。

Conclusion: SwaGen能够指导设计鲁棒的人工群体并加深对自然群体动态的理解。

Abstract: Swarms, such as schools of fish or drone formations, are prevalent in both
natural and engineered systems. While previous works have focused on the social
interactions within swarms, the role of external perturbations--such as
environmental changes, predators, or communication breakdowns--in affecting
swarm stability is not fully understood. Our study addresses this gap by
modeling swarms as graphs and applying graph signal processing techniques to
analyze perturbations as signals on these graphs. By examining predation, we
uncover a "detectability-durability trade-off", demonstrating a tension between
a swarm's ability to evade detection and its resilience to predation, once
detected. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this trade-off,
explicitly tying it to properties of the swarm's spatial configuration. Toward
task-specific optimized swarms, we introduce SwaGen, a graph neural
network-based generative model. We apply SwaGen to resilient swarm generation
by defining a task-specific loss function, optimizing the contradicting
trade-off terms simultaneously.With this, SwaGen reveals novel spatial
configurations, optimizing the trade-off at both ends. Applying the model can
guide the design of robust artificial swarms and deepen our understanding of
natural swarm dynamics.

Main category: q-bio.QM

Motivation: 开发高效的RNA递送系统需要新的离子化脂质，但现有机器学习方法在数据质量、特征表示和预测准确性方面存在不足。

Method: LANTERN结合了不同的机器学习模型，特别是基于Morgan指纹和专家描述符的多层感知机。

Result: LANTERN在预测转染效率方面表现优异（R² = 0.8161），显著超过之前的AGILE模型（R² = 0.2655）。

Conclusion: LANTERN为LNP转染预测提供了强大的基准框架，有望加速RNA递送系统的设计。

Abstract: The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle
(LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based
therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of
machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular
structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead
identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data
quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor
generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection
Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection
efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse
set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for
transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with
chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints,
outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings,
such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a
combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest
performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE
($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN
consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus,
LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction
and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems
design.

Conclusion: SPATIA为空间转录组学提供了多尺度、跨模态的解决方案，显著提升了分析性能。

Abstract: Understanding how cellular morphology, gene expression, and spatial
organization jointly shape tissue function is a central challenge in biology.
Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution
measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but machine learning
methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited
resolution. We address the problem of learning unified, spatially aware
representations that integrate cell morphology, gene expression, and spatial
context across biological scales. This requires models that can operate at
single-cell resolution, reason across spatial neighborhoods, and generalize to
whole-slide tissue organization. Here, we introduce SPATIA, a multi-scale
generative and predictive model for spatial transcriptomics. SPATIA learns
cell-level embeddings by fusing image-derived morphological tokens and
transcriptomic vector tokens using cross-attention and then aggregates them at
niche and tissue levels using transformer modules to capture spatial
dependencies. SPATIA incorporates token merging in its generative diffusion
decoder to synthesize high-resolution cell images conditioned on gene
expression. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 17 million
cell-gene pairs, 1 million niche-gene pairs, and 10,000 tissue-gene pairs
across 49 donors, 17 tissue types, and 12 disease states. We benchmark SPATIA
against 13 existing models across 12 individual tasks, which span several
categories including cell annotation, cell clustering, gene imputation,
cross-modal prediction, and image generation. SPATIA achieves improved
performance over all baselines and generates realistic cell morphologies that
reflect transcriptomic perturbations.

Key words: 机械性血栓切除术, 大血管闭塞, 深度学习, 预测模型, 个体化治疗

TL;DR: 利用深度学习模型预测大血管闭塞（LVO）卒中患者的功能性结果和个体化治疗效果，整合临床数据和影像学信息。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 尽管机械性血栓切除术已成为LVO卒中的标准治疗，但仅50%成功治疗的患者预后良好，因此需要更精准的预测工具。

Method: 基于449名LVO卒中患者的随机临床试验数据，开发可解释的深度学习模型，结合临床变量、非增强CT（NCCT）和血管造影（CTA）扫描。

Result: 临床变量对功能性结果的预测效果较好（AUC 0.719），加入CTA后略有提升（AUC 0.737），NCCT无显著改善。个体化治疗效果估计的区分能力有限（C-for-Benefit约0.55）。

Conclusion: 模型成功整合了影像学与临床特征，但个体化治疗效果估计需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy has become the standard of care in patients with
stroke due to large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, only 50% of successfully
treated patients show a favorable outcome. We developed and evaluated
interpretable deep learning models to predict functional outcomes in terms of
the modified Rankin Scale score alongside individualized treatment effects
(ITEs) using data of 449 LVO stroke patients from a randomized clinical trial.
Besides clinical variables, we considered non-contrast CT (NCCT) and
angiography (CTA) scans which were integrated using novel foundation models to
make use of advanced imaging information. Clinical variables had a good
predictive power for binary functional outcome prediction (AUC of 0.719 [0.666,
0.774]) which could slightly be improved when adding CTA imaging (AUC of 0.737
[0.687, 0.795]). Adding NCCT scans or a combination of NCCT and CTA scans to
clinical features yielded no improvement. The most important clinical predictor
for functional outcome was pre-stroke disability. While estimated ITEs were
well calibrated to the average treatment effect, discriminatory ability was
limited indicated by a C-for-Benefit statistic of around 0.55 in all models. In
summary, the models allowed us to jointly integrate CT imaging and clinical
features while achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance and ITE
estimates. Yet, further research is needed to particularly improve ITE
estimation.

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 超声图像中的斑点模式会掩盖解剖细节，影响诊断准确性。现有深度学习方法计算成本高，不适用于资源受限的便携设备。

Method: EdgeSRIE由无监督去斑点分支和去模糊分支组成，网络被量化为8位整数精度，部署在低功耗系统芯片上。

Result: 在各种评测中，EdgeSRIE取得了最高的对比噪声比和平均梯度幅度，且实时推理速度超过60帧/秒。

Conclusion: EdgeSRIE在资源有限的环境中实现了高质量的实时超声成像。

Abstract: Speckle patterns in ultrasound images often obscure anatomical details,
leading to diagnostic uncertainty. Recently, various deep learning (DL)-based
techniques have been introduced to effectively suppress speckle; however, their
high computational costs pose challenges for low-resource devices, such as
portable ultrasound systems. To address this issue, EdgeSRIE, which is a
lightweight hybrid DL framework for real-time speckle reduction and image
enhancement in portable ultrasound imaging, is introduced. The proposed
framework consists of two main branches: an unsupervised despeckling branch,
which is trained by minimizing a loss function between speckled images, and a
deblurring branch, which restores blurred images to sharp images. For hardware
implementation, the trained network is quantized to 8-bit integer precision and
deployed on a low-resource system-on-chip (SoC) with limited power consumption.
In the performance evaluation with phantom and in vivo analyses, EdgeSRIE
achieved the highest contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and average gradient
magnitude (AGM) compared with the other baselines (different 2-rule-based
methods and other 4-DL-based methods). Furthermore, EdgeSRIE enabled real-time
inference at over 60 frames per second while satisfying computational
requirements (< 20K parameters) on actual portable ultrasound hardware. These
results demonstrated the feasibility of EdgeSRIE for real-time, high-quality
ultrasound imaging in resource-limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 传统字典匹配在MRF中面临计算和内存成本的指数增长，限制了多参数成像的可扩展性，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出GAST-Mamba框架，利用结构化状态空间模型捕捉长程空间依赖，设计双Mamba编码器和GAST处理器。

Result: 在5倍加速MRF数据上，T1 PSNR达33.12dB，优于SCQ；T2 PSNR达30.62dB，SSIM为0.9124；活体实验显示解剖细节改进和伪影减少。

Conclusion: GAST-Mamba为高欠采样MRF提供准确重建，是传统方法的可扩展替代方案。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast quantitative imaging by
matching signal evolutions to a predefined dictionary. However, conventional
dictionary matching suffers from exponential growth in computational cost and
memory usage as the number of parameters increases, limiting its scalability to
multi-parametric mapping. To address this, recent work has explored deep
learning-based approaches as alternatives to DM. We propose GAST-Mamba, an
end-to-end framework that combines a dual Mamba-based encoder with a Gate-Aware
Spatial-Temporal (GAST) processor. Built on structured state-space models, our
architecture efficiently captures long-range spatial dependencies with linear
complexity. On 5 times accelerated simulated MRF data (200 frames), GAST-Mamba
achieved a T1 PSNR of 33.12~dB, outperforming SCQ (31.69~dB). For T2 mapping,
it reached a PSNR of 30.62~dB and SSIM of 0.9124. In vivo experiments further
demonstrated improved anatomical detail and reduced artifacts. Ablation studies
confirmed that each component contributes to performance, with the GAST module
being particularly important under strong undersampling. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of GAST-Mamba for accurate and robust
reconstruction from highly undersampled MRF acquisitions, offering a scalable
alternative to traditional DM-based methods.

Result: 实验在仿真和桌面光学系统中验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该技术简化了傅里叶叠层成像的采集过程，同时保持了高分辨率和宽视场的能力。

Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) is a powerful light-based synthetic aperture
imaging technique that allows one to reconstruct a high-resolution, wide
field-of-view image by computationally integrating a diverse collection of
low-resolution, far-field measurements. Typically, FP measurement diversity is
introduced by changing the angle of the illumination or the position of the
camera; either approach results in sampling different portions of the target's
spatial frequency content, but both approaches introduce substantial costs and
complexity to the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce Inverse
Synthetic Aperture Fourier Ptychography, a novel approach to FP that foregoes
changing the illumination angle or camera position and instead generates
measurement diversity through target motion. Critically, we also introduce a
novel learning-based method for estimating k-space coordinates from dual plane
intensity measurements, thereby enabling synthetic aperture imaging without
knowing the rotation of the target. We experimentally validate our method in
simulation and on a tabletop optical system.

consistent with pneumonia in which inflammation is caused in the alveolous

Thus, the diagnosis of COVID using CT scans has been effective in assisting
with RT-PCR diagnosis and severity classifications. In this paper, we proposed
a new data quality control pipeline to refine the quality of CT images based on
GAN and sliding windows. Also, we use class-sensitive cost functions including

Result: 在EndoVis2018和EndoVis2017数据集上分别达到了0.80和0.54的mIoU。

Conclusion: 该模型通过自动化手术场景理解，有效帮助手术学员独立学习复杂手术环境。

Abstract: Holistic surgical scene segmentation in robot-assisted surgery (RAS) enables
surgical residents to identify various anatomical tissues, articulated tools,
and critical structures, such as veins and vessels. Given the firm
intraoperative time constraints, it is challenging for surgeons to provide
detailed real-time explanations of the operative field for trainees. This
challenge is compounded by the scarcity of expert surgeons relative to
trainees, making the unambiguous delineation of go- and no-go zones
inconvenient. Therefore, high-performance semantic segmentation models offer a
solution by providing clear postoperative analyses of surgical procedures.
However, recent advanced segmentation models rely on user-generated prompts,
rendering them impractical for lengthy surgical videos that commonly exceed an
hour. To address this challenge, we introduce Surg-SegFormer, a novel
prompt-free model that outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.
Surg-SegFormer attained a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.80 on the
EndoVis2018 dataset and 0.54 on the EndoVis2017 dataset. By providing robust
and automated surgical scene comprehension, this model significantly reduces
the tutoring burden on expert surgeons, empowering residents to independently

Abstract: Understanding surgical scenes can provide better healthcare quality for
patients, especially with the vast amount of video data that is generated
during MIS. Processing these videos generates valuable assets for training
sophisticated models. In this paper, we introduce CLIP-RL, a novel contrastive
language-image pre-training model tailored for semantic segmentation for

reinforcement learning and curriculum learning, enabling continuous refinement
of the segmentation masks during the full training pipeline. Our model has
shown robust performance in different optical settings, such as occlusions,
texture variations, and dynamic lighting, presenting significant challenges.
CLIP model serves as a powerful feature extractor, capturing rich semantic
context that enhances the distinction between instruments and tissues. The RL
module plays a pivotal role in dynamically refining predictions through
iterative action-space adjustments. We evaluated CLIP-RL on the EndoVis 2018

Motivation: 由于全切片图像（WSI）尺寸极大且诊断信息稀疏，现有方法计算成本高，专家标注困难，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: SASHA结合轻量级分层注意力多实例学习（MIL）模型和深度强化学习，智能采样并选择性放大高分辨率区域。

Result: SASHA在计算和内存成本显著降低的情况下，性能与全分辨率分析方法相当，且优于其他稀疏采样方法。

Conclusion: SASHA为大规模医学图像自动化诊断提供了一种高效的智能采样解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology.
Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering
it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution.
Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert
annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive.
Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small
fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full
resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based
{\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep
reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological
images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight
hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second,
SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction
(10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show
that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at
high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs.
In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods.
We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging
challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images
containing sparsely informative features.

Abstract: The philosophy of mathematical practice (PMP) looks to evidence from working
mathematics to help settle philosophical questions. One prominent program under
the PMP banner is the study of explanation in mathematics, which aims to
understand what sorts of proofs mathematicians consider explanatory and what
role the pursuit of explanation plays in mathematical practice. In an effort to
address worries about cherry-picked examples and file-drawer problems in PMP, a
handful of authors have recently turned to corpus analysis methods as a
promising alternative to small-scale case studies. This paper reports the
results from such a corpus study facilitated by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, a
model whose reasoning capabilities, advances in hallucination control and large
context window allow for the accurate analysis of hundreds of pages of text per
query. Based on a sample of 5000 mathematics papers from arXiv.org, the
experiments yielded a dataset of hundreds of useful annotated examples. Its aim
was to gain insight on questions like the following: How often do
mathematicians make claims about explanation in the relevant sense? Do
mathematicians' explanatory practices vary in any noticeable way by subject
matter? Which philosophical theories of explanation are most consistent with a
large body of non-cherry-picked examples? How might philosophers make further
use of AI tools to gain insights from large datasets of this kind? As the first

### [723] [Audio-JEPA: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Audio Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02915)
*Ludovic Tuncay,Etienne Labbé,Emmanouil Benetos,Thomas Pellegrini*

Key words: Audio-JEPA, 自监督学习, JEPA, 音频处理, 频谱掩码

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对音频数据的自监督学习框架Audio-JEPA，通过预测掩码频谱的潜在表示，减少了对训练数据的需求，性能仍优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 基于JEPA框架，针对音频数据设计自监督学习模型，减少训练数据依赖并提高性能。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer架构，预测掩码频谱区块的潜在表示，预训练数据为未标注的AudioSet音频片段。

Result: 在X-ARES评估中，性能优于wav2vec 2.0和data2vec，且仅用不到五分之一的数据和无超参数调优。

Conclusion: Audio-JEPA是一种高效的音频自监督学习框架，减少了数据需求并保持高性能。

Abstract: Building on the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) paradigm, a
recent self-supervised learning framework that predicts latent representations
of masked regions in high-level feature spaces, we propose Audio-JEPA (Audio
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), tailored specifically for audio data.
Audio-JEPA uses a simple Vision Transformer backbone to predict latent
representations of masked spectrogram patches rather than reconstructing raw
audio. We pre-train on unlabeled AudioSet clips (10s, 32kHz) with random patch
masking on mel-spectrograms. We evaluate on the X-ARES suite covering speech,
music, and environmental sound tasks. Although our implementation is a
straightforward translation of the original model to audio, the results still
show comparable performance to wav2vec 2.0 and data2vec while using less than
one-fifth of their training data and with no hyper-parameter tuning. All code
and pretrained checkpoints will be released on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）影响全球超1000万人，语音障碍常早于运动症状多年出现。现有的深度学习模型虽准确率高，但缺乏临床所需的可解释性。

Method: 提出RECA-PD架构，结合可解释的语音特征与自监督表示，通过分段长录音缓解性能下降问题。

Result: RECA-PD在语音检测PD方面达到最先进性能，并提供一致且临床有意义的解释。

Conclusion: 性能和可解释性并非相互排斥，未来研究将增强对非专家用户的解释实用性。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech
impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable
modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models
achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for
clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and
explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech
features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art
performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are
more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate
that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be
mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance
and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will
enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity
estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) traditionally relies on auditory data
analysis for emotion classification. Several studies have adopted different
methods for SER. However, existing SER methods often struggle to capture subtle
emotional variations and generalize across diverse datasets. In this article,
we use Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) as spectral features to
bridge the gap between computational emotion processing and human auditory
perception. To further improve robustness and feature diversity, we propose a
novel 1D-CNN-based SER framework that integrates data augmentation techniques.
MFCC features extracted from the augmented data are processed using a 1D
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture enhanced with channel and
spatial attention mechanisms. These attention modules allow the model to
highlight key emotional patterns, enhancing its ability to capture subtle
variations in speech signals. The proposed method delivers cutting-edge
performance, achieving the accuracy of 97.49% for SAVEE, 99.23% for RAVDESS,
89.31% for CREMA-D, 99.82% for TESS, 99.53% for EMO-DB, and 96.39% for EMOVO.
Experimental results show new benchmarks in SER, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach in recognizing emotional expressions with high
precision. Our evaluation demonstrates that the integration of advanced Deep
Learning (DL) methods substantially enhances generalization across diverse
datasets, underscoring their potential to advance SER for real-world deployment
in assistive technologies and human-computer interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 音乐生成AI的技术进步引发伦理挑战，如缺乏透明度和责任，需推动开放模型发展以应对这些问题。

Method: 基于LLM开放性评估框架，针对音乐领域调整，并通过用户调研优化，形成MusGO框架（13类开放性标准）。

Result: 评估了16个领先模型，提供开放性排行榜，促进透明和负责任的发展。

Conclusion: MusGO框架明确了音乐生成AI的开放性概念，为行业标准化和监管提供了参考。

Abstract: Since 2023, generative AI has rapidly advanced in the music domain. Despite
significant technological advancements, music-generative models raise critical
ethical challenges, including a lack of transparency and accountability, along
with risks such as the replication of artists' works, which highlights the
importance of fostering openness. With upcoming regulations such as the EU AI
Act encouraging open models, many generative models are being released labelled
as 'open'. However, the definition of an open model remains widely debated. In
this article, we adapt a recently proposed evidence-based framework for
assessing openness in LLMs to the music domain. Using feedback from a survey of
110 participants from the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) community, we
refine the framework into MusGO (Music-Generative Open AI), which comprises 13
openness categories: 8 essential and 5 desirable. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art generative models and provide an openness leaderboard that is
fully open to public scrutiny and community contributions. Through this work,
we aim to clarify the concept of openness in music-generative AI and promote
its transparent and responsible development.

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 现有延音踏板检测仅限于二分类任务，无法捕捉真实演奏中踏板深度的音乐表达效果。本文旨在通过连续深度估计提升性能。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，不仅能完成传统二分类任务，还可高精度估计连续踏板深度。通过合成数据集研究房间声学影响，使用“留一法”测试模型在未知环境中的表现。

Result: 模型在连续踏板深度估计上表现优异，但基线模型及本文模型在面对未知房间声学环境时均不够鲁棒。统计分析显示混响会影响预测并导致高估偏差。

Conclusion: 高分辨率踏板深度估计能更好地反映音乐表达，但模型对未知声学环境的适应性有待改进。

Abstract: Piano sustain pedal detection has previously been approached as a binary
on/off classification task, limiting its application in real-world piano
performance scenarios where pedal depth significantly influences musical
expression. This paper presents a novel approach for high-resolution estimation
that predicts continuous pedal depth values. We introduce a Transformer-based
architecture that not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the
traditional binary classification task but also achieves high accuracy in
continuous pedal depth estimation. Furthermore, by estimating continuous
values, our model provides musically meaningful predictions for sustain pedal
usage, whereas baseline models struggle to capture such nuanced expressions
with their binary detection approach. Additionally, this paper investigates the
influence of room acoustics on sustain pedal estimation using a synthetic
dataset that includes varied acoustic conditions. We train our model with
different combinations of room settings and test it in an unseen new
environment using a "leave-one-out" approach. Our findings show that the two
baseline models and ours are not robust to unseen room conditions. Statistical
analysis further confirms that reverberation influences model predictions and
introduces an overestimation bias.

Conclusion: 通过数据预处理和单语言训练策略，能够有效利用嘈杂广播数据优化语音模型。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Dutch archival television broadcast data for
self-supervised learning of speech foundation models, specifically wav2vec 2.0.
We first study data quality assumptions for pre-training, and show how music,
noise and speaker overlap affect SSL convergence and downstream fine-tuning
performance. Secondly, we explore effectively pre-processing strategies to
convert the noisy broadcast dataset into a qualitative dataset for
pre-training, by using Whisper and WhisperX., Thirdly, we compare mono-lingual
and multi-lingual pre-training with equivalent amounts of data, and show that
mono-lingual pre-training is more robust to out-of-domain data. Lastly, we
achieve a state-of-the-art LARGE wav2vec 2.0 model for the Dutch language, by a
continuation of pre-training a wav2vec 2.0 XLS-R model checkpoint with our 55k
hour archival dataset.

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 通过预训练模型提升音乐符号的理解能力，并在多种下游任务中验证其有效性。

Result: 在12个下游任务中表现优异，验证了预训练目标的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的预训练目标显著提升了模型在音乐符号理解任务中的性能。

Abstract: We propose a pre-trained BERT-like model for symbolic music understanding
that achieves competitive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks.
To achieve this target, we design two novel pre-training objectives, namely
token correction and pianoroll prediction. First, we sample a portion of note
tokens and corrupt them with a limited amount of noise, and then train the
model to denoise the corrupted tokens; second, we also train the model to
predict bar-level and local pianoroll-derived representations from the
corrupted note tokens. We argue that these objectives guide the model to better
learn specific musical knowledge such as pitch intervals. For evaluation, we
propose a benchmark that incorporates 12 downstream tasks ranging from chord
estimation to symbolic genre classification. Results confirm the effectiveness
of the proposed pre-training objectives on downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 传统模型难以处理非洲-巴西Maracatu传统音乐中复杂的节奏模式，该研究旨在通过迁移学习解决这一问题，并减少标注需求。

Method: 采用了两种预训练的Temporal Convolutional Network架构（分别针对鼓点检测和节拍跟踪），并通过分层微调策略对五种传统打击乐器进行优化。

Result: 实验结果显示性能显著提升，F1分数在鼓点检测任务中达到0.998，最佳情况下性能提升超过50个百分点。跨任务适配对节奏乐器尤其有效。

Conclusion: 研究表明乐器特定的适配策略至关重要，为代表性不足的音乐传统提供了高效的人工标注最小化方法，推动了非西方音乐语境下的音乐信息检索工具发展。

Abstract: We explore transfer learning strategies for musical onset detection in the
Afro-Brazilian Maracatu tradition, which features complex rhythmic patterns
that challenge conventional models. We adapt two Temporal Convolutional Network
architectures: one pre-trained for onset detection (intra-task) and another for
beat tracking (inter-task). Using only 5-second annotated snippets per
instrument, we fine-tune these models through layer-wise retraining strategies
for five traditional percussion instruments. Our results demonstrate
significant improvements over baseline performance, with F1 scores reaching up
to 0.998 in the intra-task setting and improvements of over 50 percentage
points in best-case scenarios. The cross-task adaptation proves particularly
effective for time-keeping instruments, where onsets naturally align with beat
positions. The optimal fine-tuning configuration varies by instrument,
highlighting the importance of instrument-specific adaptation strategies. This
approach addresses the challenges of underrepresented musical traditions,
offering an efficient human-in-the-loop methodology that minimizes annotation
effort while maximizing performance. Our findings contribute to more inclusive
music information retrieval tools applicable beyond Western musical contexts.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在说话人转换和情感语音任务中表现出高灵活性和良好的感知质量。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够直观地控制语音转换，同时保持高清晰度和说话人相似性。

Abstract: Precise control over speech characteristics, such as pitch, duration, and
speech rate, remains a significant challenge in the field of voice conversion.
The ability to manipulate parameters like pitch and syllable rate is an
important element for effective identity conversion, but can also be used
independently for voice transformation, achieving goals that were historically
addressed by vocoder-based methods.
  In this work, we explore a convolutional neural network-based approach that
aims to provide means for modifying fundamental frequency (F0), phoneme
sequences, intensity, and speaker identity. Rather than relying on
disentanglement techniques, our model is explicitly conditioned on these
factors to generate mel spectrograms, which are then converted into waveforms
using a universal neural vocoder. Accordingly, during inference, F0 contours,
phoneme sequences, and speaker embeddings can be freely adjusted, allowing for
intuitively controlled voice transformations.
  We evaluate our approach on speaker conversion and expressive speech tasks
using both perceptual and objective metrics. The results suggest that the
proposed method offers substantial flexibility, while maintaining high
intelligibility and speaker similarity.

Motivation: 研究Boomerang采样在音乐音频领域的适用性，探索其作为数据增强工具的潜力。

Method: 在Stable Audio Open中实现Boomerang采样，用于生成接近现有示例的音乐音频，并测试其在节拍跟踪器和乐器替换中的应用。

Result: Boomerang采样能保留音乐的节奏结构，在有限训练数据下提升节拍跟踪器性能，并能实现单音输入中的乐器替换。

Conclusion: Boomerang采样在音乐数据增强和内容编辑中具有潜力，尤其是在资源受限的场景下。

Abstract: Generative models of music audio are typically used to generate output based
solely on a text prompt or melody. Boomerang sampling, recently proposed for
the image domain, allows generating output close to an existing example, using
any pretrained diffusion model. In this work, we explore its application in the
audio domain as a tool for data augmentation or content manipulation.
Specifically, implementing Boomerang sampling for Stable Audio Open, we augment
training data for a state-of-the-art beat tracker, and attempt to replace
musical instruments in recordings. Our results show that the rhythmic structure
of existing examples is mostly preserved, that it improves performance of the
beat tracker, but only in scenarios of limited training data, and that it can
accomplish text-based instrument replacement on monophonic inputs. We publish
our implementation to invite experiments on data augmentation in other tasks
and explore further applications.

Conclusion: Expotion通过多模态控制和PEFT方法显著提升了音乐生成质量，并发布了一个新的同步视频-音乐数据集。

Abstract: We propose Expotion (Facial Expression and Motion Control for Multimodal
Music Generation), a generative model leveraging multimodal visual controls -
specifically, human facial expressions and upper-body motion - as well as text
prompts to produce expressive and temporally accurate music. We adopt
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) on the pretrained text-to-music
generation model, enabling fine-grained adaptation to the multimodal controls
using a small dataset. To ensure precise synchronization between video and
music, we introduce a temporal smoothing strategy to align multiple modalities.
Experiments demonstrate that integrating visual features alongside textual
descriptions enhances the overall quality of generated music in terms of
musicality, creativity, beat-tempo consistency, temporal alignment with the
video, and text adherence, surpassing both proposed baselines and existing
state-of-the-art video-to-music generation models. Additionally, we introduce a
novel dataset consisting of 7 hours of synchronized video recordings capturing
expressive facial and upper-body gestures aligned with corresponding music,
providing significant potential for future research in multimodal and
interactive music generation.

Conclusion: LAPS-Diff通过多模态嵌入和风格引导机制，有效提升了歌唱语音合成的自然性和表现力。

Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements
in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches.
However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and
language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in
low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion
model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided
learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We
curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract
word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation.
Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to
compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness
and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal
style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec
models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional
priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on
objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff
significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the
considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is
typical of the low resource scenario.
