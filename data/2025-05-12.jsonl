Most previous research on HTC has focused on\nsupervised methods. However, in real-world scenarios, employing supervised HTC\ncan be challenging due to a lack of annotated data. Moreover, HTC often faces\nissues with large label spaces and long-tail distributions. In this work, we\npresent Knowledge Graphs for zero-shot Hierarchical Text Classification\n(KG-HTC), which aims to address these challenges of HTC in applications by\nintegrating knowledge graphs with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide\nstructured semantic context during classification. Our method retrieves\nrelevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs related to the input text using a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. Our KG-HTC can enhance LLMs to\nunderstand label semantics at various hierarchy levels. We evaluate KG-HTC on\nthree open-source HTC datasets: WoS, DBpedia, and Amazon. Our experimental\nresults show that KG-HTC significantly outperforms three baselines in the\nstrict zero-shot setting, particularly achieving substantial improvements at\ndeeper levels of the hierarchy.

Our approach first\ntransforms raw text into entity-recognized text, and subsequently into\nstructured form. Furthermore, beyond the overall data structuring framework, we\nalso enhance entity recognition performance by introducing an entity marker-a\nsimple yet effective technique that uses symbolic annotations to highlight\ntarget entities. Specifically, our entity marker-based hybrid approach not only\nconsistently outperforms previous entity recognition approaches across three\nbenchmark datasets (MatScholar, SOFC, and SOFC slot NER) but also improve the\nquality of final structured data-yielding up to a 58% improvement in\nentity-level F1 score and up to 83% improvement in relation-level F1 score\ncompared to direct approach."}

However,\nmodern feature-modeling dialects often contain constructs, such as cardinality\nconstraints, that are ill-suited for conversion to CNF. This mismatch between\nthe input of reasoning engines and the available feature-modeling dialects\nlimits the applicability of the more expressive constructs. In this work, we\nshorten this gap between expressive constructs and scalable automated\nreasoning. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a pseudo-Boolean\nencoding for feature models, which facilitates smaller representations of\ncommonly employed constructs compared to Boolean encoding. Second, we propose a\nnovel method to compile pseudo-Boolean formulas to Boolean d-DNNF.

We do so\nby discovering rules of the form $X \\rightarrow Y$ where $X$ and $Y$ are\nsequential patterns. Rules like these are simple to understand and provide a\nclear description of the relation between the antecedent and the consequent. To\ndiscover succinct and non-redundant sets of rules we formalize the problem in\nterms of the Minimum Description Length principle. As the search space is\nenormous and does not exhibit helpful structure, we propose the Seqret method\nto discover high-quality rule sets in practice. Through extensive empirical\nevaluation we show that unlike the state of the art, Seqret ably recovers the\nground truth on synthetic datasets and finds useful rules from real datasets."}

With the\nincreasing presence of artificial agents in daily life, it is essential to\nunderstand how people perceive and trust these agents. One of the key\nchallenges affecting this perception is the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE), where\nincreasingly human-like artificial beings can be perceived as eerie or\nrepelling. Despite growing interest in trust and the UVE, existing research\nvaries widely in terms of how these concepts are defined and operationalized.\nThis inconsistency raises important questions about how and under what\nconditions the UVE influences trust in agents. A systematic understanding of\ntheir relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact\nof the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns,\nlimitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature. Following PRISMA\nguidelines, a systematic search identified 53 empirical studies that\ninvestigated both UVE-related constructs and trust or trust-related outcomes.\nStudies were analyzed based on a structured set of categories, including types\nof agents and interactions, methodological and measurement approaches, and key\nfindings. The results of our systematic review reveal that most studies rely on\nstatic images or hypothetical scenarios with limited real-time interaction, and\nthe majority use subjective trust measures. This review offers a novel\nframework for classifying trust measurement approaches with regard to the\nbest-practice criteria for empirically investigating the UVE.

YOLO-DCAP\nincorporates a Multi-scale Dilated Residual Convolution (MDRC) block to capture\nmulti-scale features at scale with varying dilation rates, and an\nAttention-aided Spatial Pooling (AaSP) module to focus on the global relevant\nspatial regions, enhancing feature selection. These structural improvements\nhelp to better localize objects in satellite imagery. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that YOLO-DCAP significantly outperforms both the YOLO base model\nand state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average improvement of 20.95% in\nmAP50 and 32.23% in IoU over the base model, and 7.35% and 9.84% respectively\nover state-of-the-art alternatives, consistently across all three satellite\ndatasets. These consistent gains across all three satellite datasets highlight\nthe robustness and generalizability of the proposed approach.

We evaluate AgentXploit on two public benchmarks, AgentDojo\nand VWA-adv, where it achieves 71% and 70% success rates against agents based\non o3-mini and GPT-4o, respectively, nearly doubling the performance of\nbaseline attacks. Moreover, AgentXploit exhibits strong transferability across\nunseen tasks and internal LLMs, as well as promising results against defenses.\nBeyond benchmark evaluations, we apply our attacks in real-world environments,\nsuccessfully misleading agents to navigate to arbitrary URLs, including\nmalicious sites."}

Subsequently, the operation of the\nparks after the configuration of a 50kW/100kWh energy storage system was\nsimulated, and the total cost and operation strategy of the energy storage\nsystem were calculated. The results showed that after the deployment of energy\nstorage, the amount of wind and solar power curtailment in each park decreased,\nand the operational costs were reduced. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used\nto optimize the energy storage configuration of each park. The energy storage\noperation strategy was optimized through fitness functions, crossover\noperations, and mutation operations. After optimization, the economic\nindicators of Parks A, B, and C all improved. The research results indicate\nthat by optimizing energy storage configuration, each park can reduce costs,\nenhance economic benefits, and achieve sustainable development of the power\nsystem."}

We also\nfind evidence of statistically significant ($>2\\sigma$) oxygen excesses for\nSDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of\noxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical\nsurveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community,\n$\\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs,\ntherefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar\ncompositions."}
