However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop\nprincipled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs."}

In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can\nemerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual\nstructure of Unicode glyphs.

This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The\nresulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning\nbenchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic\nforgetting.

How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of\ndifferent pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and\nunderstudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),\na new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to\nshape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between\nefficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several\ncombination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple\nAtari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the\ngeneralization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number\nof models influences agents' performance during and after training."}

In contrast, RL promotes generalization and\nbrevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though\nthe improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.\nSurprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive\ntraining strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to\nproduce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning\nstyle, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for\nmore seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined\npost-training techniques for reasoning VLMs."}

Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed\npipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and\ncommunication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential\nadversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously\noverlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the\nmodel are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the\nintermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.\nWe demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker\ncan craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning\nsystem significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the\nintercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill\nsurrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples\nagainst the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy\nspecifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing\nthe original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple\nstatistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to\nenable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic\nexperimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models\ntrained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,\ntremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks.

Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive."}

To\nclose the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the\ngeneration of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,\ngenerating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,\nposes a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,\nsafety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which\nsignals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC\nsystem, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already\nestablished as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory\nepilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements\nor specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the\neffect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments\nare standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients\nwhile failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal\nhealth data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile\nand robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To\nshow the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical\nrequirements for therapeutic GBA modulation.

Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet\nstructure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This\ntokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific\nfeatures, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention\nlayers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public\ndatasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were\nharmonized and aggregated.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting\nmodel to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference\nimages. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single\nreference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that\nfaithfully integrates content from all reference images.

As the complexity of the model\nincreases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional\nbias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number\nof observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become\ninfinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the\ndouble descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.\nMoreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor\nthat Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when\npossible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model\nselection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future\nresearch."}

While existing\nN-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order\ncomparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on\ntask-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,\nwe propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk\nminimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to\nenhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation\nprocesses of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic\nformulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk\nestimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We\nfurther establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To\ndemonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four\nrepresentative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case\nof our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from\nnegative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical\nrisk.

A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the\nconventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on\nresponse tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction\ntuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of\ndifferentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,\nand propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to\nconventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language\nmodels of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different\nsizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard\ninstruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited\nrobustness to input prompt variations.
