However, due\nto limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to\ndetect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal\nsensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system\nwhile detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been\nproposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider\nonly variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover,\nalthough a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on\ninterventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which\nis impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we\nintroduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for\npartially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection.

However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM\njudges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building\nbetter verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'\nperformance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable\ndevelopment of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address\nthis, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for\nsystematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions\ncovering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is\nequipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the\nevaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a\nmultidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental\nframework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized\nverifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.\ncomplete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers\nfundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve\nleading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show\nstronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover\nverifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in\ncross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks\nof current verifier technology."}

Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully\nsimulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly\nlearning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional\ncomputational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic\ninnovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and\nadvanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning\nchaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence\nproblems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics\nincluding energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses.

Among these,\nDecision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of\noffline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned\npolicy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results\ntherefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.\nFrom prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward\nenvironments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?"}

In\nthis paper, we extend the $\\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit\nassignment based on the $\\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based\nmethods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view\nformulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation\ncompatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed\nalgorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and\nMinAtar environments, respectively.

Existing LLM-based approaches transfer knowledge\nlearned from text data to time series prediction using prompting or fine-tuning\nstrategies. However, LLMs are proficient at reasoning over discrete tokens and\nsemantic patterns but are not initially designed to model continuous numerical\ntime series data. The gaps between text and time series data lead LLMs to\nachieve inferior performance to a vanilla Transformer model that is directly\ntrained on TSF data. However, the vanilla Transformers often struggle to learn\nhigh-level semantic patterns. In this paper, we design a novel\nTransformer-based architecture that complementarily leverages LLMs and vanilla\nTransformers, so as to integrate the high-level semantic representations\nlearned by LLMs into the temporal information encoded by time series\nTransformers, where a hybrid representation is obtained by fusing the\nrepresentations from the LLM and the Transformer.

The proposed\nmethod constructs an accurate reference point cloud map via continuous scanning\nfrom the target LiDAR and sliding-window LiDAR bundle adjustment, while\nformulating extrinsic calibration as a joint LBA optimization problem. This\nmethod effectively mitigates cumulative mapping errors and achieves\noutlier-resistant parameter estimation through an adaptive weighting mechanism.\nExtensive evaluations in both the CARLA simulation environment and real-world\nscenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art calibration\ntechniques in both accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show that for\nnon-overlapping sensor configurations, our framework achieves an average\ntranslational error of 5 mm and a rotational error of 0.2{\\deg}, with an\ninitial error tolerance of up to 0.4 m/30{\\deg}. Moreover, the calibration\nprocess operates without specialized infrastructure or manual parameter tuning.\nThe code is open source and available on GitHub\n(\\underline{https://github.com/Silentbarber/DLBAcalib})"}

While recent\nLLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection\naccuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),\nthey struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs.

This paper introduces SEALGuard, a\nmultilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse\nlanguages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing\nguardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in\nLLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak\nprompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art\nLlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and\n18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In\ncontrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual\nunsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and\nachieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score.

However, their deployment in safety-critical\nsettings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design,\nand (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As\nclinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of\nits predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high\nconfidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting\nconfidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce\ncontext-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate\nresponses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive\naccuracy.

To better aggregate knowledge from clients,\nensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often\nemployed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global\nmodel. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not\nalways yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The\nreason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,\nwhile being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for\nthe knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to\nmaintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align\nthe features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize\nthe projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and\nthus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD\nachieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

Often, as is the\ncase of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate\nvanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /\nlocally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time\nLQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT\nand DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like\nconditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these\ngeneralizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects\nof errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from\nadversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a\nsimulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic\ncomputations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from\nlimited data.

Notably, GWM introduces\naction nodes to support diverse tasks, where action nodes are linked to other\nnodes via direct reference or similarity computation. Extensive experiments on\nsix tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,\nrecommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,\nand planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches\ndomain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and\ndemonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks.

In the\nresearch field of deep learning-assisted diagnosis of AD, traditional\nconvolutional neural networks and simple feature concatenation methods fail to\neffectively utilize the complementary information between multimodal data, and\nthe simple feature concatenation approach is prone to cause the loss of key\ninformation during the process of modal fusion. In recent years, the\ndevelopment of deep learning technology has brought new possibilities for\nsolving the problem of how to effectively fuse multimodal features. This paper\nproposes a novel deep learning algorithm framework to assist medical\nprofessionals in AD diagnosis. By fusing medical multi-view information such as\nbrain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), genetic data, and clinical data, it can accurately detect the\npresence of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN).\nThe innovation of the algorithm lies in the use of an asymmetric cross-modal\ncross-attention mechanism, which can effectively capture the key information\nfeatures of the interactions between different data modal features. This paper\ncompares the asymmetric cross-modal cross-attention mechanism with the\ntraditional algorithm frameworks of unimodal and multimodal deep learning\nmodels for AD diagnosis, and evaluates the importance of the asymmetric\ncross-modal cross-attention mechanism.

This contrasts\nwith traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is\nreferred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective\nLagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic\nscenarios introduces a major challenge.

It is further compounded by the joint\ncomplexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among\nparticipants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict\nphysical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce\nMulti-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for\nLagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with\na learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic\nscenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement\nlearning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a\nresidual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable\nnominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic\nscenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts.

The rapid\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning\ncapabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual\ninformation for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video\nreasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content\nwhile reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning\nparadigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive\nand cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the\nVideo-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for\nkey-video selection and manually verified.

We develop a\nphysics-constrained machine learning framework that augments transport models\nand boundary conditions to extend the applicability of continuum solvers in\nnonequilibrium hypersonic regimes. We employ deep learning PDE models (DPMs)\nfor the viscous stress and heat flux embedded in the governing PDEs and trained\nvia adjoint-based optimization. We evaluate these for two-dimensional\nsupersonic flat-plate flows across a range of Mach and Knudsen numbers.\nAdditionally, we introduce a wall model based on a mixture of skewed Gaussian\napproximations of the particle velocity distribution function. This wall model\nreplaces empirical slip conditions with physically informed, data-driven\nboundary conditions for the streamwise velocity and wall temperature. Our\nresults show that a trace-free anisotropic viscosity model, paired with the\nskewed-Gaussian distribution function wall model, achieves significantly\nimproved accuracy, particularly at high-Mach and high-Knudsen number regimes.\nStrategies such as parallel training across multiple Knudsen numbers and\ninclusion of high-Mach data during training are shown to enhance model\ngeneralization.

When $r=1$ this is the\nwell-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work\n\\cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and\ndeveloped bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms\nfor the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function.\nThese are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting\nproblems as special cases.

In\nthis paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when\n$r$ is a \\emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering\nmultiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria\napproximation algorithm that for any given integer $\\alpha \\ge 1$ outputs a set\n$S$ such that $f_i(S) \\ge$ $(1-1/e^\\alpha -\\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \\in [r]$\nand $\\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \\le (1+\\epsilon)\\alpha \\cdot \\sf{OPT}$.

To investigate the relationship between environmental\nconditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as\nfood reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary\nsimulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate\nreward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators,\nand learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation\nrevealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important\nfor prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators\nevolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator\nwith increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but\nalso that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are\nbad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive\nrewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with\nabundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear\nand social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through\nevolution, along with the nature of predators and threats."}

Grale is widely applicable because of its ability to efficiently learn\nand construct a graph on datasets with multiple types of features.

Despite its significance, progress in the field has been\nhindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,\nwhich is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.\nDue to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal\nimages has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of\nanomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of\ngeneralization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.\nFurthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly\nfocus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),\noverlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that\nare commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce\na benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and\nsystematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and\nbenchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach\nleveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the\nbest performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when\nencountering certain unseen anomalies.
