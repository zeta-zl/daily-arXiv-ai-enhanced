However, such\napproaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the\nunderlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.\n  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.\nRather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured\nnumerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain\nknowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a\nnumeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an\neffect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference\naligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction\nmodel using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.\n  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach\n-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a\n21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and\noutperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our\nresults demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating\nsystematic evidence synthesis."}

Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus\nnarrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human\noversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static\nor binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity,\ncriticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework\ngrounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped\nto Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This\nenables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions,\nincluding monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident\nresponse. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research\nby creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various\nSOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to\noperational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified\nthrough a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a\nfine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates\nhuman-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing\nresponse coordination, and strategically calibrating trust. This research\nsystematically presents both the theoretical and practical aspects and\nfeasibility of designing next-generation cognitive SOCs that leverage AI not to\nreplace but to enhance human decision-making."}

In large dimension, the small time limit\nmakes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial\ncorrelation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical\nscore and analyze its bias-variance trade-off.

Regularization on the score has the same\neffect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent\nmemorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better\nvariance control under some regularity conditions of the true data\ndistribution.

In artificial neural networks, this\nis typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by\ninjecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters\nthemselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as\nserotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn\nweights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.\nRather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we\noptimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To\naccomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as\nthe minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric\nmovement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects\na single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for\na particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.\nFirst, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a\nconvenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.\nSecond, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging\ngeneralization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several\ntopologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.\nnoise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their\nsimplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks\nby input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.\nThese results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds\noffers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning."}

However, prior\nwork has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP\nobjective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP\ntraining, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually\nincreases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a\nreverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the\nforward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during\npre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output\nquality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding.

Querying\napproaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,\nand without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face\nsignificant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.\nConstructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these\ndimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class.

This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a\nnovel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational\noperations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate\nricher feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a\nlearnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix\ninvolves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship\nbetween LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an\nextra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and\nproperly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues\nas the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks\nacross 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We\nalso provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of\nrepresentations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically\nsimilar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing\ndistance ones further apart. We will release our code to the community."}

Our error bound is the first to (i)\nconsider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of\nepistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each\nof multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries\nof the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the\nsettings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within\n$\\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization\nbounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and\nvalidate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting."}

Specifically, we\ncombine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a\nfine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns\nthe top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are\nthen merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.\n  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the\ndevelopment set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on\nthe development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31\nteams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to\nthe top-ranked system.

Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder\nattention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier\nto identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context\nrelevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies\nclosely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,\nSentinel achieves up to 5$\\times$ compression while matching the QA performance\nof 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native\nattention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context\ncompression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel."}

Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the\nlaunching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby\naddressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited\nrange, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic\nfeatures: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3)\nflexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic\nand acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5)\nen-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being\ntransported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle\ntransit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)\nto minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational\nchallenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm,\nFINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to\nprovide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various\ninstance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in\nterms of solution quality and computation time.

The results of this\nanalysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological\ninformation from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance\nand is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments."}

Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k\ndataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nspatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of\nvisual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

For each class, lightweight neural networks are\nused to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC\nparticularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.\nWe establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard\nconditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for\nr-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several\npractical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and\nfactor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy\nregularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods.

In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this\nestimator is weakly consistent (as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$) under potentially\nvery stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a\nvanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a\n``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths\nof a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are\nobtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency\nis established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are\nvery sparse and disconnected."}

While they excel in zero-shot and\ntransfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,\noften yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a\nsignificant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can\nlead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a\ntraining-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of\nestimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed\nmodality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly\nrepresented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring\nfunction that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We\nrigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4\narchitectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with\nimprovements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95\ncompared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model\nwithout requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of\nVLMs in real-world applications.

However, improving their\nspatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k\ndataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nspatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of\nvisual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

In this\npaper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve\nrebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of\ndiverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic\nsubstitutions to spatially-dependent cues (\"head\" over \"heels\").
