During training,\nthese approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which\nare merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it\nallows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to\nlow-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this\nproblem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained\nand unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model\n$M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak\npredictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the\ntwo weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base\nmodel with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted\nmodel learns to exploit for improved performance.

They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined.

Specifically,\nresearchers struggle to understand the relationships between tasks, assess how\nwell current models perform across them, and determine the criteria in\ndeveloping new foundation models. To fill this gap, we present PFMBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark evaluating protein foundation models across 38 tasks\nspanning 8 key areas of protein science. Through hundreds of experiments on 17\nstate-of-the-art models across 38 tasks, PFMBench reveals the inherent\ncorrelations between tasks, identifies top-performing models, and provides a\nstreamlined evaluation protocol. Code is available at\n\\href{https://github.com/biomap-research/PFMBench}{\\textcolor{blue}{GitHub}}."}

Directly\napplying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at\nspecific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that\ndeviate significantly from the actual conditions.

However, using brightness temperature data\nfrom geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the\nchanges in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation,\nwe can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its\ninversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more\nrealistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve\nthe accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we\npropose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS).

To evaluate\nTRAINCHECK, we reproduce 20 real-world silent training errors with diverse root\ncauses. TRAINCHECK successfully detects 18 errors within a single training\niteration. It also uncovers 6 unknown bugs in popular training libraries that\nlead to silent errors."}

Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window.

This task requires\nMLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding\nnot only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual\nelements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex\ntask often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose\n{ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction.\nFirst, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To\naccomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of\nstructured instructions: description and difference. The description\ninstruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the\ndifference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference\nchart and the generated chart. These instructions effectively transform visual\nfeatures into language representations, thereby facilitating the subsequent\ncode translation process.

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy.

Both models were\nclinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival\nanalyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic\nfactors.\n  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error\nof 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining\naccuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge\noutperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.\nFAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the\nhighest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest\n(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the\nindependent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,\nrace and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary\nprognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct\nfacial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved\nprognostic accuracy.\n  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable\nfacial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related\nmortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using\nrelatively small clinical datasets."}

For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and\nGuru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open\nmodels RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by\n7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We\nalso show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their\nbase models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining\ndata.

We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense\nlatents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be\ndismissed as training noise."}

Ideally, training an\nSAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.\nHowever, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising\nconcerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model.

S3PO adopts recurrent\nmodelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques\nlike alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss\nfunction addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most\nstate-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\\deg}~specific\nsuper-resolution models on 360{\\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study\nis presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen\narchitectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation."}

We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with\n1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their\ndescriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the\nmajority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This\nfinding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions\nlacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified\nthe majority of original descriptions as \"Example\" (79.75%), which is identical\nto our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared\nto the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of\n0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9\nindicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the\ncode snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions\nfor usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a\nlibrary."}

Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion\nreconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower\nreconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods\ndirectly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced\nby inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency\ndetail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a\nFrequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical\nimage diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific\nmid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to\nreconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our\nfrequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image\ndifficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the\nmid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index\nscore between the reconstructed and original images.

In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of\nsafety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building\non this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank\nExtrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety\nsubspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness\nof LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both\nbenign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's\nadaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute\nreductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning\nattacks.

Ideally, training an\nSAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.\nHowever, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising\nconcerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In\nthis work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of\ndense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect\nmeaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend\nto form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual\nstream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense\nfeatures in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an\nintrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction.

We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves\nreasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL\nsetup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for\nranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE\nachieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while\noffering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime,\ncompared to tree search-based automatic annotation. The codebase, along with a\ntrained SPARE-PRM model, is publicly released to facilitate further research\nand reproducibility."}

However, due to their semantic\nobscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them.\nExisting methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the\nassociations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit\nemotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses,\nwe propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based\non bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis\nmodule deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor.\nNext, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source\ndomains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole\nand metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the\nmutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification\nmechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments\nshow that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.\nSpecifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for\nhyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on\nthe HYPO-L dataset.
