As a\nbehavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied\nretrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and\nhallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and\nfactually coherent content generation."}

Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on\ndiscriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task\nformulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address\nthese critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which\ncomprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual\nfeatures for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets.\nBuilding on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive\nDynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG).\nTDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and\ndestination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node\ngeneration to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data.\nTo enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the\nstructural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further\npropose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for\nreproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key\ninsights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in\nDyTAG generation.

To surgically eliminate redundant operations while preserving\ncritical ones, we propose Greedily Sorted Operation Pruning (GSOP), a\ndata-driven method that directly prunes operations rather than tokens. GSOP\nfirst decomposes a VLM decoder's computations into atomic operations along\nthree dimensions: token groups, layer positions, and computation modules. GSOP\ndetermines the pruning order of operations through greedy sorting: GSOP\niteratively selects the redundant operation that incurs minimal performance\ndrop considering previously pruned operations.

GSOP enhances sorting efficiency\nthrough: a) leveraging historical operation rankings to avoid redundant\nevaluations; b) excluding the ``free-to-prune\" and ``danger-to-prune\"\noperations from sorting.

Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study\ninvolved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization\nalgorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)\napplied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of\nthe proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an\nexisting approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining\nour proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs).

Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been\nproposed as the state of the art for solving assignment problems. DRL methods\nusually employ a neural network (NN) as an approximator for the policy\nfunction, which ingests the state of the process and outputs a valuation of the\npossible assignments. However, representing the state and the possible\nassignments so that they can serve as inputs and outputs for a policy NN\nremains an open challenge, especially when tasks or resources have features\nwith an infinite number of possible values. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes a method for representing and solving assignment problems with\ninfinite state and action spaces. In doing so, it provides three contributions:\n(I) A graph-based feature representation of assignment problems, which we call\nassignment graph; (II) A mapping from marked Colored Petri Nets to assignment\ngraphs; (III) An adaptation of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm that\ncan learn to solve assignment problems represented through assignment graphs.\nTo evaluate the proposed representation method, we model three archetypal\nassignment problems ranging from finite to infinite state and action space\ndimensionalities.

We examine the\ncapabilities and limitations of LLMs and provide a detailed computational\nbiology case study (on modeling HIV rebound dynamics) demonstrating how\niterative interactions with an LLM (ChatGPT) can facilitate interdisciplinary\ncollaboration and research. We argue that LLMs are best used as augmentative\ntools within a human-in-the-loop framework. Looking forward, we envisage that\nthe responsible use of LLMs will enhance innovative cross-disciplinary research\nand substantially accelerate scientific discoveries."}

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser.

Reliable\ndetection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily\nevaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more\ncommonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor\ngeneralisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce\nWETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT\ndetection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia\neditors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,\nSummarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new\ndatasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three\nprompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing\nprompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,\ntraining-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot\ndetectors average 58%.

The dataset is organized into two parts: BMMR-Eval\nthat comprises 20,458 high-quality instances to comprehensively assess LMMs'\nknowledge and reasoning across multiple disciplines in both Chinese and\nEnglish; and BMMR-Train that contains 88,991 instances to support further\nresearch and development, extending the current focus on mathematical reasoning\nto diverse disciplines and domains. In addition, we propose the process-based\nmulti-discipline verifier (i.e., BMMR-Verifier) for accurate and fine-grained\nevaluation of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on 24 models reveal that\n(i) even SOTA models (e.g., o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro) leave substantial headroom\non BMMR-Eval; (ii) reasoning models exhibit discipline bias and outperform LMMs\nonly on specific subjects; (iii) open-source models still trail their\nproprietary counterparts; and (iv) fine-tuning on BMMR-Train narrows this gap.\nAdditionally, we conduct reasoning-chain analyses using BMMR-Verifier and other\nin-depth studies, uncovering the challenges LMMs currently face in\nmultidisciplinary reasoning.

We present a comprehensive evaluation of LRM-1B across multiple\nproblem variants, distributions, and sizes, establishing state-of-the-art\nresults. Our findings reveal that LRM-1B not only adapts to different VRP\nchallenges but also showcases superior performance, outperforming existing\nmodels. Additionally, we explore the scaling behavior of neural routing models\nfrom 1M to 1B parameters. Our analysis confirms power-law between multiple\nmodel factors and performance, offering critical insights into the optimal\nconfigurations for foundation neural routing solvers."}

To address these issues, we propose\nLumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through\nthree mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss\n(ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head\nover-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail\nRecommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to\nguide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a\nGPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically\ngenerates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity\nand distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly\nimprove recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and\nINSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over\nfifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency,\ninformativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair\nlong-tail conversational recommender."}

This study addresses\na foundational question: should the architectural design of a neural operator\nreflect the strength of physical coupling it aims to model? To answer this, we\npresent the first comprehensive, architecture-aware evaluation of DeepONet\nvariants across three regimes: single-physics, weakly coupled, and strongly\ncoupled multiphysics systems. We consider a reaction-diffusion equation with\ndual spatial inputs, a nonlinear thermo-electrical problem with bidirectional\ncoupling through temperature-dependent conductivity, and a viscoplastic\nthermo-mechanical model of steel solidification governed by transient\nphase-driven interactions.

Business angels offer a\ncritical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and\nresource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has\ninvestigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels\nconsider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals\nand several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work\nvalidating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its\nadoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated\nmachine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as\ninput features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy\n(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant\ncorrelation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional\nhuman-graded evaluations. The integration of AI-based feature extraction with a\nstructured and validated decision-making framework yielded a scalable,\nreliable, and less-biased model for evaluating startup pitches, removing the\nconstraints that previously limited adoption."}

Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of\ncorrect outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness\nis evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A\nbenchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test\nthe Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model.

While existing methods often rely on centralized\nfine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time\nadaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This\nlimitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized\nuser-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the\ngeneration quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we\npresent CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time\npersonalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in\nleveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic\noutputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.\nSpecifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning\nproblem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits\nwithin the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by\ntransmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate\nvectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without\nfine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized\ngeneration tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in\ngenerating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and\nhistories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing\nwhile maintaining acceptable computational overhead."}

In this\nwork, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk\nprediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing\nhigh-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based\nmotion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle,\nother vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize\nplug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call\nDriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation\nframework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel\ninformation injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and\ntrajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial\nrelationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our\nDriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction\nperformance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy\nsoaring from 27.13% to 88.03%.

The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of\nthe proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an\nexisting approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining\nour proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs).

We evaluate GATN on diverse benchmarks, including Atari 2600,\nMuJoCo, and a custom chatbot dialogue environment, demonstrating superior\nperformance in cross-domain generalization, resilience to dynamic environments,\nand reduced computational overhead compared to baselines. Our findings suggest\nGATN is a versatile framework for real-world RL applications, such as adaptive\nchatbots and robotic control."}

The main challenge of HRL is efficient\ndiscovery of the hierarchical structure among subgoals and utilizing this\nstructure to achieve the final goal. We address this challenge by modeling the\nsubgoal structure as a causal graph and propose a causal discovery algorithm to\nlearn it. Additionally, rather than intervening on the subgoals at random\nduring exploration, we harness the discovered causal model to prioritize\nsubgoal interventions based on their importance in attaining the final goal.\nThese targeted interventions result in a significantly more efficient policy in\nterms of the training cost. Unlike previous work on causal HRL, which lacked\ntheoretical analysis, we provide a formal analysis of the problem.\nSpecifically, for tree structures and, for a variant of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\nrandom graphs, our approach results in remarkable improvements.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser.

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various\nNLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end,\nwe propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next\nToken Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has\ncomparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple\ntrials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any\npunctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed\nas the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The\ntrial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the\nless confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is\nconsistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident,\none tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to\ncautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive\nexperiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach\noutperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear\nmargin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further\nimprove over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the\npotential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/wyzjack/CNTP."}

This paper introduces ESSA\n(Evolutionary Strategies for Scalable Alignment), a new framework that uses\nEvolutionary Strategies (ES) to efficiently align LLMs without the need for\ngradient computation.

This\nenables the model to supervise itself without degrading to an MLP, thereby\nfully leveraging the Transformer's capacity to handle missing modalities. To\nhandle diverse graph information and missing modalities, NTSFormer performs a\none-time multimodal graph pre-computation that converts structural and feature\ndata into token sequences, which are then processed by a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) Input Projection and Transformer layers for effective fusion.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that NTSFormer achieves superior\nperformance on multimodal cold-start node classification tasks."}

To close this\ngap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across\ndiverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark\nthat extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video\nretrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question\nanswering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we\ntrain VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,\nvideo, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2\nachieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document\nretrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image\nbenchmarks.

In the brain, neuromodulators such as\nacetylcholine and noradrenaline relieve this tension by tuning neuronal gain\nand inhibitory gating, balancing segregation and integration of circuits. Fed\nby dense cholinergic and noradrenergic projections from the ascending arousal\nsystem, layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex offer a relevant\nsubstrate for understanding these dynamics. When distal dendritic signals\ncoincide with back-propagating action potentials, calcium plateaus turn a\nsingle somatic spike into a high-gain burst, and interneuron inhibition sculpts\nthe output. These properties make layer-5 cells gain-tunable amplifiers that\ntranslate neuromodulatory cues into flexible cortical activity. To capture this\nmechanism we developed a two-compartment Izhikevich model for pyramidal neurons\nand single-compartment somatostatin (SOM) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons,\nlinked by Gaussian connectivity and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP).\nThe soma and apical dendrite are so coupled that somatic spikes back-propagate,\nwhile dendritic plateaus can switch the soma from regular firing to bursting by\nshifting reset and adaptation variables. We show that stronger dendritic drive\nor tighter coupling raise gain by increasing the likelihood of\ncalcium-triggered somatic bursts. In contrast, dendritic-targeted inhibition\nsuppresses gain, while somatic-targeted inhibition raises the firing threshold\nof neighboring neurons, thus gating neurons output. Notably, bursting\naccelerates STDP, supporting rapid synaptic reconfiguration and\nflexibility.This suggests that brief gain pulses driven by neuromodulators\ncould serve as an adaptive two-timescale optimization mechanism, effectively\nmodulating the synaptic weight updates."}

It is invariant to the order in\nwhich the samples are received, and, if the testing problem is ``symmetric,''\nthen the algorithm is also invariant to the labeling of the domain elements,\nresolving an open question by Liu and Ye [NeurIPS'24]. We prove new lower\nbounds for uniformity, identity, and closeness testing by reducing to the case\nwhere the replicable algorithm satisfies these canonical properties.\n  We systematize and improve upon a common strategy for replicable algorithm\ndesign based on test statistics with known expectation and bounded variance.\nOur framework allow testers which have been extensively analyzed in the\nnon-replicable setting to be made replicable with minimal overhead. As direct\napplications of our framework, we obtain constant-factor optimal bounds for\ncoin testing and closeness testing and get replicability for free in a large\nparameter regime for uniformity testing.\n  We also give state-of-the-art bounds for replicable Gaussian mean testing,\nand, unlike prior work, our algorithm runs in polynomial time."}

(b) The performance of zero-shot generic foundation models improves on\nover-segmented face images than tightly cropped faces thereby suggesting the\nimportance of contextual clues. For example, at a False Match Rate (FMR) of\n0.01%, the True Match Rate (TMR) of OpenCLIP improved from 64.97% to 81.73% on\nthe LFW dataset as the face crop increased from 112x112 to 250x250 while the\nTMR of domain-specific AdaFace dropped from 99.09% to 77.31%.

Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes.

Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we\ndefine token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink\ntoken.

In this work, we argue\nthat the infrared and visible modalities not only provide complementary\nlow-level visual features, but also share high-level semantic consistency.\nMotivated by this, we propose a Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Fusion (HSVF)\nframework, comprising a semantic stream to reconstruct haze-free scenes and a\nvisual stream to incorporate structural details from the near-infrared\nmodality. The semantic stream first acquires haze-robust semantic prediction by\naligning modality-invariant intrinsic representations.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach that establishes connections between causal\ntrees through the Limit Inferior Leaf Interval (LILI) clustering algorithm.\nLILIs are constructed based on the leaves of all causal trees, emphasizing the\nsimilarity of dataset confounders. When two instances with di erent treatments\nare grouped into the same leaf across a su cient number of causal trees, they\nare treated as counterfactual outcomes of each other. Through this clustering\nmechanism, LILI clustering reduces bias present in traditional causal tree\nmethods and enhances the prediction accuracy for the average treatment e ect\n(ATE). By integrating LILIs into a causal forest, we develop an e cient causal\ninference method. Moreover, we explore several key properties of LILI by\nrelating it to the concepts of limit inferior and limit superior in the set\ntheory. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the convergence of the estimated\nATE using LILI clustering. Empirically, extensive comparative experiments\ndemonstrate the superior performance of LILI clustering."}

The Rashomon Effect\nimplies that data modelers would not be able to determine which model generated\nthe data. Conversely, one of his core advantages in favor of data models is\nsimplicity, as he claimed there exists an ''Occam Dilemma,'' i.e., an\naccuracy-simplicity tradeoff. After 25 years of powerful computers, it has\nbecome clear that this claim is not generally true, in that algorithmic models\ndo not need to be complex to be accurate; however, there are nuances that help\nexplain Breiman's logic, specifically, that by ''simple,'' he appears to\nconsider only linear models or unoptimized decision trees. Interestingly, the\nRashomon Effect is a key tool in proving the nullification of the Occam\nDilemma.

Interpretability is\nuseful in its own right, and I think Breiman knew that too.\n  Technically, my modern perspective does not belong to either of Breiman's Two\nCultures, but shares the goals of both of them - causality, simplicity,\naccuracy - and shows that these goals can be accomplished in other ways,\nwithout the limitations Breiman was concerned about."}

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large\ndatasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or\nregular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on\nnon-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job\nfailures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not\nan explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In\nfact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1\nopen-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\\% of intermittent job\nfailures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using\nfew-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model\nusing a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich\nembeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based\napproach achieves 70-88\\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects,\noutperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\\% F1-score) in 4\nprojects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over\nquantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the\ndetection of intermittent job failures in organizations."}

First, current methods often rely on only\none simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn\nfine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and\nvisual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment.\nSecond, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking\nthe intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective\nmodeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a\nnovel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved\nsurvival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors\nto generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region\nlevels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various\nsurvival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features\nvia Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive\nlearning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different\nsurvival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language\nalignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation\n(CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical\ncooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region\nlevels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance."}

While existing methods often rely on centralized\nfine-tuning or static preference alignment, they struggle to achieve real-time\nadaptation under resource constraints inherent to personal devices. This\nlimitation creates a dilemma: large cloud-based models lack access to localized\nuser-specific information, while small on-device models cannot match the\ngeneration quality of their cloud counterparts. To address this dichotomy, we\npresent CoSteer, a novel collaborative framework that enables decoding-time\npersonalization through localized delta steering. Our key insight lies in\nleveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic\noutputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs.\nSpecifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning\nproblem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits\nwithin the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by\ntransmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate\nvectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without\nfine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized\ngeneration tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in\ngenerating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and\nhistories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing\nwhile maintaining acceptable computational overhead."}

As an expository contribution we demonstrate how\nto re-formulate a wide variety of challenges from deep neural networks,\n(stochastic) gradient descent, and related topics into dynamical statements. We\nalso tackle three concrete challenges. First, we consider the process of\ninformation propagation through a neural network, i.e., we study the\ninput-output map for different architectures. We explain the universal\nembedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions\nof given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural\nODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural\ndelay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks\ndynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent\nand study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis\nto the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon,\nalso in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias. For stochastic\ngradient descent, we present stability results for the overparameterized\nsetting via Lyapunov exponents of interpolation solutions. Third, we explain\nseveral results regarding mean-field limits of neural networks.

Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a\nreconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or\npre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by\nconsidering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as\nexperimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a\nfour-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background\ncontributions and unknown distortions to the target signal.

There has been much debate on what a\nworld model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.\nIn this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,\nand drawing inspiration from the concept of \"hypothetical thinking\" in\npsychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on\nworld modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating\nall actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and\nacting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a\ngeneral-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed\ncontinuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision\nlearning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN)\nAGI system enabled by such a model."}

However, the most powerful\nempathetic LSLMs are increasingly closed off, leaving the crucial details about\nthe architecture, data and development opaque to researchers. Given the\ncritical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,\nwe present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM\ndesigned to enable empathetic speech interactions. Based on our empathetic\nspeech-to-text model BLSP-Emo, OpenS2S further employs a streaming interleaved\ndecoding architecture to achieve low-latency speech generation. To facilitate\nend-to-end training, OpenS2S incorporates an automated data construction\npipeline that synthesizes diverse, high-quality empathetic speech dialogues at\nlow cost. By leveraging large language models to generate empathetic content\nand controllable text-to-speech systems to introduce speaker and emotional\nvariation, we construct a scalable training corpus with rich paralinguistic\ndiversity and minimal human supervision.

Current approaches to value alignment, which rely on centralized,\ntop-down definitions, lack the mechanisms for meaningful contestability. This\nleaves users and communities unable to challenge or shape the values embedded\nin the systems that govern their digital lives, creating a crisis of legitimacy\nand trust. This paper introduces Community-Defined AI Value Pluralism (CDAVP),\na socio-technical framework that addresses this gap. It reframes the design\nproblem from achieving a single aligned state to infrastructuring a dynamic\necosystem for value deliberation and application. At its core, CDAVP enables\ndiverse, self-organizing communities to define and maintain explicit value\nprofiles - rich, machine-readable representations that can encompass not only\npreferences but also community-specific rights and duties. These profiles are\nthen contextually activated by the end-user, who retains ultimate control\n(agency) over which values guide the AI's behavior. AI applications, in turn,\nare designed to transparently interpret these profiles and moderate conflicts,\nadhering to a set of non-negotiable, democratically-legitimated meta-rules. The\ndesigner's role shifts from crafting static interfaces to becoming an architect\nof participatory ecosystems.

This dilemma of conflicting\nrankings hampers model selection, clouds model comparisons, and adds confusion\nto a growing ecosystem of competing models. Recent work attributed ranking\ndisagreement to the phenomenon of training on the test task: As released,\ndifferent models exhibit a different level of preparation for any given test\ntask. A candidate solution to the problem is train-before-test: Give each model\nthe same benchmark-specific finetuning before evaluation. Our primary\ncontribution is a broad empirical evaluation of train-before-test across 24\nbenchmarks and 61 models. We show that train-before-test significantly improves\nranking agreement consistently across all benchmarks. Whereas rankings have\nlittle external validity to start with, they enjoy a significant degree of\nexternal validity when applying train-before-test: Model rankings transfer\ngracefully from one benchmark to the other. Even within the same model family,\ntrain-before-test reduces strong ranking disagreement to near-perfect\nagreement. In addition, train-before-test reduces the model-score matrix to\nessentially rank one, revealing new insights into the latent factors of\nbenchmark performance. Our work supports the recommendation to make\ntrain-before-test a default component of LLM benchmarking."}

To address this challenge, we propose\nEmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both\nthe physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,\na differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.\nIt jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and\nfriction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world\nobservations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a\nconditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by\ntranslating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos\nconditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer.

In this work, we\nintroduce CTA (Cross-Task Alignment), a novel approach for improving TTT.\nUnlike existing TTT methods, CTA does not require a specialized model\narchitecture and instead takes inspiration from the success of multi-modal\ncontrastive learning to align a supervised encoder with a self-supervised one.\nThis process enforces alignment between the learned representations of both\nmodels, thereby mitigating the risk of gradient interference, preserving the\nintrinsic robustness of self-supervised learning and enabling more semantically\nmeaningful updates at test-time.

In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel\nstructured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:\ndynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are\nsystematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space\nbaselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our\nframework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that\nprocesses both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed\ndynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on\ncontext and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating\ninvalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndriving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves\ntraining stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in\nparticular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control\nprecision, and generalization.

We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration.
