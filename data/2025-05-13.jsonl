However,\nexisting tool selection frameworks do not integrate MCP servers, instead\nrelying heavily on error-prone manual updates to monolithic local tool\nrepositories, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies.\nAdditionally, current approaches abstract tool selection before the LLM agent\nis invoked, limiting its autonomy and hindering dynamic re-querying\ncapabilities during multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we\nintroduce ScaleMCP, a novel tool selection approach that dynamically equips LLM\nagents with a MCP tool retriever, giving agents the autonomy to add tools into\ntheir memory, as well as an auto-synchronizing tool storage system pipeline\nthrough CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations with MCP servers as the\nsingle source of truth. We also propose a novel embedding strategy, Tool\nDocument Weighted Average (TDWA), designed to selectively emphasize critical\ncomponents of tool documents (e.g. tool name or synthetic questions) during the\nembedding process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on a created dataset of\n5,000 financial metric MCP servers, across 10 LLM models, 5 embedding models,\nand 5 retriever types, demonstrate substantial improvements in tool retrieval\nand agent invocation performance, emphasizing ScaleMCP's effectiveness in\nscalable, dynamic tool selection and invocation."}

In this paper, we\npropose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a\ncomprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the\nteaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science\ntutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor\nperformance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training\nsection of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise\ncomparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors.

In\nthis paper, we introduce the Target-Speaker Speech Processing Universal\nPerformance Benchmark (TS-SUPERB), which includes four widely recognized\ntarget-speaker processing tasks that require identifying the target speaker and\nextracting information from the speech mixture. In our benchmark, the speaker\nembedding extracted from enrollment speech is used as a clue to condition\ndownstream models. The benchmark result reveals the importance of evaluating\nSSL models in target speaker scenarios, demonstrating that performance cannot\nbe easily inferred from related single-speaker tasks. Moreover, by using a\nunified SSL-based target speech encoder, consisting of a speaker encoder and an\nextractor module, we also investigate joint optimization across TS tasks to\nleverage mutual information and demonstrate its effectiveness."}

However, this leads\nto semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant\nsampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is\nessentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of\nself-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples\nwith similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown\nsemantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how\nto extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using\nInfoNCE as a \"free lunch\" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We\nfirst prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs\naligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is\npositive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the\ncorrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive\nexperiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show\nsignificantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving\nup to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided.\nCode for IFL-GCL is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/Camel-Prince/IFL-GCL."}

Yet, traffic\nsensors measuring traffic volume are typically scarcely located, due to their\nhigh deployment and maintenance costs. To address this, interpolation methods\ncan estimate traffic volumes at unobserved locations using available data.\nGraph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume\nforecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying\nthem to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks\nexhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed\nwith many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains\nunclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph\nNeural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume\nestimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation,\nintegrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function\ntailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we\nintroduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering\ndifferent transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York\nCity taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation\nmethods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence)\nand remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. On Strava, for instance, MAE\nrises only from 7.1 to 10.5, on Taxi from 23.0 to 40.4, demonstrating strong\nperformance under extreme data scarcity, common in real-world urban settings.\nWe also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy."}

Traditional machine-generated data is typically\nderived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured\nand limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values.

With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve\ncompetitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on\nunseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for\nfine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear,\nhuman-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs\ncan reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent\nenergy disaggregation in NILM applications."}

The recently proposed ReDeEP framework decouples these\ndual mechanisms, identifying two critical contributors to hallucinations:\nexcessive reliance on parametric knowledge encoded in feed-forward networks\n(FFN) and insufficient utilization of external information by attention\nmechanisms (particularly copy heads). ReDeEP quantitatively assesses these\nfactors to detect hallucinations and dynamically modulates the contributions of\nFFNs and copy heads to attenuate their occurrence. Nevertheless, ReDeEP and\nnumerous other hallucination detection approaches have been employed at\nlogit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency\nevaluation, inadequately address the semantic dimensions of model responses,\nresulting in inconsistent hallucination assessments in RAG implementations.\nBuilding upon ReDeEP's foundation, this paper introduces SEReDeEP, which\nenhances computational processes through semantic entropy captured via trained\nlinear probes, thereby achieving hallucination assessments that more accurately\nreflect ground truth evaluations."}

Traditional DeepONet\narchitectures using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are limited by fixed time\ndiscretization and struggle to capture continuous dynamics.

Utilizing a network\nof six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor\ngateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we\nsystematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various\nenvironmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon\ndioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter\nlevels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena\nsuch as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by\nenvironmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter\nsignal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of\nindoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we\ntested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that\nintegrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental\nParameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP).

Specifically,\nthe outperformance score represents the percentile rank of the observed\nclassification performance within a reference distribution of possible\nperformances. This unified framework enables meaningful comparison and\nmonitoring of classification performance across test sets with differing\nimbalance rates. We illustrate how the outperformance scores can be applied to\na variety of commonly used classification performance metrics and demonstrate\nthe robustness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets\nspanning multiple classification applications."}

Instead of using the same training data as the teacher model, we\nsignificantly expand the student model dataset by generating unlabeled data and\nlabeling it with the teacher model predictions. Experimental results show that\nthe student model performance continues to improve as the size of the augmented\ntraining data increases. In fact, with enough augmented data, the student model\ncan outperform the teacher model.

An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as\nmitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts\nof a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level\nattribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text\ngeneration, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,\nrather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce\nConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies\nthe concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them\nimportance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current\ntoken-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through\nin-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,\ngender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and\nsteering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness\nof LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX\noutperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human\nalignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for\nrandom edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming\nattribution and paraphrasing baselines.

This capability is especially beneficial for\nhardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly\nimplement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We\ndemonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle\nlarger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without\nexceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in\nQAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending\nthe feasible range of integers to be factorized.

In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs\ninfluences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying\nthe memory capacity is the product $K \\tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the\ndelay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network\nwidth is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and\nclassical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation\nproperty. We show that if the memory capacity $K\\tau$ is sufficiently small,\nthe dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.\nConsequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack\nthe universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity\n$K\\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation\nproperty of neural DDEs for continuous functions.

However, the diversity of\nworking conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in\ninconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic\nscenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on\nclient-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to\nmap different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens\nthe aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this\narticle proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated\nInvariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype\ncontrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently,\nfeature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other\nclients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a\nfeature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain\nshifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is\ndesigned to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between\ndifferent clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and\nan orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from\nthe invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising\ngeneralization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for\ntarget clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces.\nExperiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of\nFedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes."}

Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several\ncritical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training\nsteps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize\ntraining hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and\ndomain-specific performance.
