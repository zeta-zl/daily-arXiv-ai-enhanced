We built a digital\nwriting tool that captures both what students type and how their essays evolve\nover time. Twenty students used this tool to write timed essays, which were\nthen evaluated in two ways: (i) LLM generated feedback using both the final\nessay and the full writing trace, and (ii) After the task, students completed\nsurveys about how useful and relatable they found the feedback. Early results\nshow that learners preferred the process-aware LLM feedback, finding it more in\ntune with their own thinking. We also found that certain types of edits, like\nadding new content or reorganizing paragraphs, aligned closely with higher\nscores in areas like coherence and elaboration. Our findings suggest that\nmaking LLMs more aware of the writing process can lead to feedback that feels\nmore meaningful, personal, and supportive."}

Comparative analysis of structural\nfeature distributions reveals that AFDB structures exhibit distinct statistical\nregularities, reflecting a systematic geometric bias that deviates from the\nconformational diversity found in experimentally determined structures from the\nProtein Data Bank (PDB). While AFDB structures are cleaner and more idealized,\nPDB structures capture the intrinsic variability and physical realism essential\nfor generalization in downstream tasks. To address this discrepancy, we\nintroduce a Debiasing Structure AutoEncoder (DeSAE) that learns to reconstruct\nnative-like conformations from intentionally corrupted backbone geometries. By\ntraining the model to recover plausible structural states, DeSAE implicitly\ncaptures a more robust and natural structural manifold. At inference, applying\nDeSAE to AFDB structures produces debiased structures that significantly\nimprove inverse folding performance across multiple benchmarks.

Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source\nmodels), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve\ndatasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K,\nInfo-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\\% without\nperformance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without\ntuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\\% with\nsemi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement\nusing unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/Info-Coevolution/."}

Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP,\npowering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research\nattention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level\nsemantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often\nimplicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context.\nCurrent embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth\nand evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a\nresult, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker\nstance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that\neven state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic\nbaselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm\nshift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically\ngrounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic\nunderstanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling\nobjective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity."}

To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional\nVital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any\ntarget waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or\narterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single\nmodel. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin\nTransformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture\ndistinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct\nmulti-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our\nframework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average\nacross all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and\nimproving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the\ngenerated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical\nInstrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British\nHypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By\neliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe\nthat this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital\nsign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring."}

Nevertheless, existing\nmulti-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from\ncognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators\nemploy different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free\ntranslation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating\noutputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed\nmulti-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with\nCognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six\nfunctionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in\nhuman translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement,\nevaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By\nsimulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC\neffectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation.\nExperimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24\nbenchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by\nan average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it\nfurther improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/weiyali126/TACTIC."}

To address this gap, we investigated brain\nalignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity\nrecorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with\naudio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized\ninstruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned\nMLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that\ninstruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned\nmultimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for\nboth video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear\ndisentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise\ndifferentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find\nthat MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas\nshowing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and\nlanguage regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide\nclear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the\nalignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping\njoint information processing in both the systems.

Effective OOD detection after deployment could benefit\nfrom access to the training data, enabling direct comparison between test\nsamples and the training data distribution to identify differences.\nState-of-the-art OOD detection methods, however, either discard training data\nafter deployment or assume that test samples and training data are centrally\nstored together, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world settings. This\nis because shipping training data with the deployed model is usually impossible\ndue to the size of training databases, as well as proprietary or privacy\nconstraints. We introduce the Isolation Network, an OOD detection framework\nthat quantifies the difficulty of separating a target test sample from the\ntraining data by solving a binary classification task. We then propose\nDecentralized Isolation Networks (DIsoN), which enables the comparison of\ntraining and test data when data-sharing is impossible, by exchanging only\nmodel parameters between the remote computational nodes of training and\ndeployment. We further extend DIsoN with class-conditioning, comparing a target\nsample solely with training data of its predicted class. We evaluate DIsoN on\nfour medical imaging datasets (dermatology, chest X-ray, breast ultrasound,\nhistopathology) across 12 OOD detection tasks. DIsoN performs favorably against\nexisting methods while respecting data-privacy. This decentralized OOD\ndetection framework opens the way for a new type of service that ML developers\ncould provide along with their models: providing remote, secure utilization of\ntheir training data for OOD detection services.

These\ndiffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally\nlack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \\textit{Dispersive\nLoss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves\ndiffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal\nrepresentations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive\nself-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive\nsample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used\nfor regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment\n(REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no\npre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate\nDispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report\nconsistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work\nwill help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation\nlearning."}

To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based\nreward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost\nreward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway\ntoward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions\nonly on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example\nperformance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection.\nExperiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1\noutperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while\nmaintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1."}
