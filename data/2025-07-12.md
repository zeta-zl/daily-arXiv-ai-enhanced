### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Key words: 大语言模型, 认知偏差, 预训练, 微调, 交叉调优

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）的认知偏差，提出了一种两步因果实验方法，发现偏差主要源于预训练而非微调。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究旨在明确LLMs中认知偏差的来源（预训练、微调或随机噪声），为解决偏差问题提供理论基础。

Method: 通过多次微调不同随机种子的模型，以及交叉调优（交换指令数据集），分离偏差来源。

Result: 训练随机性虽引入变异性，但认知偏差主要由预训练决定，而非微调。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏差需考虑预训练的根源，这为未来评估和减轻LLMs偏差提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Key words: 大语言模型、社会科学调查、响应偏差、近期偏差、鲁棒性测试

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在社会科学调查中作为人类代理的可靠性及对已知响应偏差的敏感性，发现模型对问题表述和选项结构的变化敏感，并一致表现出近期偏差。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: LLMs越来越多地被用作社会科学调查中人类受试的代理，但其可靠性和对已知响应偏差的敏感性尚不明确，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 在规范调查背景下测试九种不同LLMs，对World Values Survey问题应用11种干扰（包括问题措辞和选项结构），模拟了超过167,000次访谈。

Result: 发现所有测试模型均表现出一致但强度不同的近期偏差，对最后呈现的选项偏袒；模型对语义变化和联合干扰敏感，较大模型虽更稳健但仍受影响。

Conclusion: LLMs部分与人类调查响应偏差一致，强调了提示设计和鲁棒性测试在生成合成调查数据时的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Key words: 合成文本, 评估工具, 隐私保护, 高风险领域, 多维度分析

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个用于全面评估合成文本的工具包，支持多维度评价，以提高合成文本的可行性和隐私保护效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 合成文本在AI系统中具有广泛应用潜力，但需要多维度评估以确保其效果和隐私安全。

Method: 工具包提供生成模块和评估模块，涵盖下游系统效用、公平性、隐私泄漏风险、分布差异及专家反馈。

Result: 在医疗和法律等高风险领域验证了工具包的功能和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估指标，SynthTextEval提升了合成文本的实用性和隐私保护能力。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Key words: 医疗LLMs, 安全评估, 红队测试, 患者安全, 临床医生

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对医疗领域大型语言模型(LLMs)的安全评估方法，特别关注患者和临床医生的视角，填补了该领域的空白。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，但现有评估主要集中于通用领域，缺乏针对医疗场景的专门标准。

Method: 设计了患者视角的安全评估协议PatientSafetyBench（包含466个样本的5类关键指标），并结合临床医生和普通用户视角，对医疗LLMs进行红队测试。

Result: 通过案例研究（MediPhi模型集）验证了该方法的有效性，首次从三类用户视角定义了医疗LLMs的安全评估标准。

Conclusion: 为医疗领域LLMs的安全部署奠定了基础，需进一步结合多视角评估。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Key words: 打断检测,协作学习,多组对话,重叠语音,课堂环境

TL;DR: 研究分析了单对话和多组对话中的打断行为，提出了一种适用于课堂环境的抗重叠语音打断检测方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 协作学习中打断行为对知识构建至关重要，但现有研究多基于单对话环境，难以适用于多组对话的嘈杂课堂。

Method: 开发了一种抗重叠语音的打断识别方法，并分析了打断行为的语言和韵律特征。

Result: 提出了一种适用于课堂环境的打断检测方法，揭示了打断行为的特征。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在多组对话环境中追踪打断行为提供了基础。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体检索增强框架，用于生成针对健康误传的反驳言论，结合多种LLM优化知识检索、证据增强和响应细化，优于基线方法，并通过消融研究和人工评估验证了框架的必要性和有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前研究在生成反驳言论时依赖有限证据且对最终输出控制不足，为解决这些问题，提出了多智能体框架。

Method: 结合静态和动态证据的多智能体检索增强框架，优化知识检索、证据增强和响应细化。

Result: 方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性上优于基线，消融研究验证了框架的必要性，人工评估显示细化显著提升反驳言论质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架能生成高质量反驳言论，有效应对健康误传。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Key words: 深度学习, GNN, CNN, 图生成, 长文本处理

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新型模型架构，通过实时图生成机制处理长文本，相比传统Transformer更高效且性能优异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决Transformer在处理长文本时因二次计算复杂度带来的效率低下问题。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，实时生成图结构，利用字符级输入和LLM嵌入信息，通过CNN捕捉局部模式，图结构扩展感受野，小世界图聚合文档信息。

Result: 模型表现出高效的性能和竞争力，生成图具有有意义的语义组织结构（聚类系数约0.45，最短路径长度4-5）。

Conclusion: 该模型在长文本处理任务中表现出显著的时间和资源效率优势。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 在医疗领域部署生成式 AI 时，确保 AI 生成的个性化内容易于理解是关键挑战。

Method: 引入了 MedReadCtrl 框架，通过可读性控制的指令调优，使 LLMs 能够在不损失意义的情况下调整输出复杂度。

Result: 在多个任务和数据集的评估中，MedReadCtrl 显著优于 GPT-4，尤其在低识字水平下获得专家青睐。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl 提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，支持患者教育并促进 AI 在医疗领域的公平应用。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

*Zonghai Yao,Youxia Zhao,Avijit Mitra,David A. Levy,Emily Druhl,Jack Tsai,Hong Yu*

Key words: 驱逐、社会健康决定因素、电子健康记录、大语言模型、信息提取

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction 是一个结合大语言模型、人工标注和自动提示优化的可扩展流程，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐状态，创建了最大的公共驱逐相关社会健康决定因素数据集，并在性能和成本效率上超越了现有模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 驱逐作为社会健康决定因素（SDoH）的重要性被低估，且电子健康记录（EHRs）中缺乏结构化编码，限制了应用。

Method: 结合大语言模型、人工标注和自动提示优化（APO）的流程，创建大规模数据集。

Result: 训练后的模型在驱逐和其他 SDoH 类别上的 Macro-F1 分数分别达到 88.8% 和 90.3%，优于 GPT-4o-APO 和 BioBERT，同时显著降低了标注成本。

Conclusion: 该流程可推广到其他信息提取任务，大幅提升效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 为开发可解释的小型模型，使其能够用自然语言解释时间模式。

Method: 利用合成数据集生成自然语言注释，监督微调小型Qwen模型，并引入评估指标。

Result: 微调后的模型具备了有意义的解释能力，显示出将时间序列理解压缩到轻量级模型的可行性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发可解释的小型模型提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

Key words: Large Language Model agents, action deliberation, self-consistency, execution-guided critique

TL;DR: 本文提出了SAND框架，通过让LLM代理在做出行动前明确审议候选行动，解决了现有方法因动作空间探索不足而导致的次优行动选择问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有LLM代理优化方法侧重于模仿专家行为或偏好优化，忽视了动作空间的全面探索，导致代理可能做出看似合理但实际次优的行动选择。

Method: 提出SAND框架，结合自一致性动作采样和执行引导的动作评估，通过LLM代理的基模型合成逐步的动作审议思路，并利用生成的审议轨迹迭代微调代理。

Result: 在两个代表性的交互代理任务中，SAND比初始监督微调平均提升了20%的性能，并超越了现有最先进的代理优化方法。

Conclusion: SAND框架通过动作审议显著提升了LLM代理的决策质量，证明了其在优化代理性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决强化学习训练中的不稳定性和策略漂移问题。

Method: RLEP在训练中混合新生成的数据与高质量回放轨迹。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升准确率，如AIME-2024从38.2%到39.9%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过回放成功经验实现了更快收敛和更强性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further
research.

Key words: 机器废话, 大语言模型, 废话指数, RLHF, CoT, AI对齐

TL;DR: 该论文提出了‘机器废话’作为大语言模型（LLM）中失真现象的框架，设计了‘废话指数’和新分类法，通过实验验证了RLHF和CoT对废话的加剧作用，揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLM中失真现象的广泛性及其机制，以解决AI真实性缺失的问题。

Method: 提出了废话指数和四种废话分类法，并在多个数据集（包括新设计的BullshitEval）上进行实证评估。

Result: 发现RLHF和CoT显著加剧了废话现象，政治背景下废话尤为普遍，其中‘模糊措辞’占主导。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的挑战，为提升LLM真实性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 提升LLM的推理能力是研究核心，当前代码模拟方法依赖复杂数据结构，易过拟合算法模式而非本质推理。

Method: TeaR结合数据筛选和强化学习，引导模型在代码任务中发现最优推理路径。

Result: 实验显示TeaR在多任务和多规模模型上均表现优异，Qwen2.5-7B和R1-Distilled-7B分别提升35.9%和5.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR有效提升了LLM的通用推理能力，展现了数据与学习方法的重要性。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: ORR催化剂对提升燃料电池效率至关重要，但从复杂的科学文献中提取结构化信息仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用DyGIE++和多种BERT变体（如MatSciBERT、PubMedBERT）进行NER与RE，构建FC-CoMIcs语料库，并手动标注数据集。

Result: PubMedBERT在NER任务中F1得分最高（82.19%），MatSciBERT在RE任务中最佳（66.10%），验证了领域专用模型的优势。

Conclusion: 领域专用BERT模型（如PubMedBERT和MatSciBERT）在ORR催化剂信息提取中优于通用科学模型（如BlueBERT），适用于自动化文献分析。

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着基于Transformer的语言模型在AI中的广泛应用，研究者对其能力的界限，特别是所谓的“幻觉”现象（即模型生成虚假、事实错误或无意义信息）以及在自主代理任务中的应用潜力产生了浓厚兴趣。

Method: 从LLM推理的计算复杂性角度出发，分析了模型在计算和代理任务中的表现，并给出了具体示例。

Result: 研究证明，LLMs无法完成超出一定复杂度的计算和代理任务，同时也无法验证超出复杂度限制的任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 这些发现对LLMs在现实世界任务中的应用提出了重要限制，并为其能力边界提供了理论支持。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 应对心理支持需求增长但数据稀缺的问题，特别是在非英语语言中。

Method: 结合有限真实数据和专家知识，微调Dialog Generator和Dialog Modifier两个模型；构建CPsDD数据集；开发CADSS系统，包含Profiler、Summarizer、Planner和Supporter。

Result: 构建CPsDD数据集（68K对话）；CADSS在Strategy Prediction和ESC任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 框架和系统有效解决了心理支持数据稀缺问题，性能达到最优。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Motivation: 传统的研究主要关注双人对话，而本研究旨在扩展语音活动预测模型以应对三元对话场景，填补了这一领域的空白。

Method: 研究训练了多个模型，使用一个包含三元对话的日语数据集，参与者讨论了多种话题。

Result: 研究发现，基于三元对话训练的VAP模型在所有模型中表现优于基线，但对话类型会影响预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 本研究证明了VAP可以用于三元对话中的轮流发言预测，未来的工作将把这一模型整合到口语对话系统中。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Method: 采用精心设计的少量示例提示技术，结合LLM，实验了包括辩论式提示和示例选择策略在内的多种高级提示工程方法。

Result: 系统在CheckThat! 2025主观性检测任务中表现优异，尤其是在阿拉伯语和波兰语中排名第一，在其他语言中进入前四。阿拉伯语的鲁棒性尤为突出。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Method: 使用阿拉伯语-英语的企业数据集构建基准测试，涵盖用户查询和支持文档的所有语言组合，并提出一种均衡检索策略。

Result: 研究发现跨语言检索是主要瓶颈，性能下降显著。通过均衡检索策略，大幅提升了跨语言和整体性能。

Conclusion: 论文指出在多语言实际应用中改进检索的机会，并提出了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 探索SFT和RL在多模态推理任务中的独立作用及协同效果，以优化VLM的推理能力。

Method: 通过多种训练策略（如两阶段、交错或渐进训练）及数据混合与模型合并，研究SFT和RL的效果。

Result: SFT提升难题表现但增加冗余，RL增强泛化与简洁性；两者结合未能实现协同增效。

Conclusion: 需要更自适应的方法以实现SFT和RL在VLM中的无缝结合。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Conclusion: M4Doc在高效计算下实现高质量的文档图像翻译。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Conclusion: KD结合少量提示可在资源受限场景中实现高效的QA系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Motivation: 解决复杂问题时，现有方法主要依赖语言模型的检索与推理能力，但效率（如检索次数）未受到足够关注。

Method: 通过标准ReAct流水线改进提示，并结合少量有监督和基于强化学习的微调，优化RAG的效率和性能。

Result: 改进后的方法在HotPotQA等基准测试中表现优于现有技术，且检索成本减半。

Conclusion: 大规模微调并非必要，少量训练和提示改进可显著提升RAG的效率和性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Motivation: 中文内容审核中语音伪装替换（PCR）问题日益突出，现有方法依赖规则合成的扰动，忽略了真实用户的创造力，因此需要更真实的数据和方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 论文首先对PCR进行了四种表面形式的分类，并收集了500个自然发生的RedNote数据集。通过测试现有模型的性能，提出了一种基于拼音的提示策略。

Result: 实验表明，现有最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.672，零样本思维链提示效果更差。而拼音提示策略显著提升了检测准确率。

Conclusion: 研究首次全面分类了中文PCR问题，提供了一个现实的基准数据集，并提出了一种轻量的拼音提示方法，为稳健毒性检测研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 目前评估摘要质量的方法通常依赖耗时的人工参考摘要，因此需要一种自动化指标来衡量摘要的语义保留和压缩效果。

Method: NOIR通过语言模型嵌入测量语义相似性，并结合摘要长度的压缩比，量化摘要的语义保留程度。

Result: 实验表明，NOIR能够有效捕捉摘要的长度与语义保留之间的权衡，并与人类对摘要质量的感知高度相关。

Conclusion: NOIR为评估和改进摘要算法、提示词及合成摘要提供了一种自动化工具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 观察发现多头注意力（MHA）的性能随注意力头数量增加而提升，但需要隐藏维度足够大。希望通过模拟更多头和维度来提升性能，同时控制参数成本。

Method: 引入SAS方法，将低维头表示投影到高维空间以模拟更多头和更大隐藏维度；提出PEAA以高效聚合注意力。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务上，SAS优于其他注意力变体，显著提升性能。

Conclusion: SAS通过模拟更多头和维度的方式实现了高效且性能优越的注意力机制。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型 (LLMs) 在知识扩展方面的高资源消耗问题，现有检索增强生成 (RAG) 方法在可扩展性和答案准确性上存在不足。

Method: K2RAG 框架采用分治思想，结合稠密和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱和文本摘要技术，并通过数据预处理步骤显著减少训练时间。

Result: 在 MultiHopRAG 数据集上的实验表明，K2RAG 在答案相似度和执行速度上显著优于传统 RAG 方法，训练时间减少了 93%，VRAM 需求减少了三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG 是一种高效且可扩展的知识扩展方法，为 LLMs 提供了一种资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Key words: 文本嵌入,隐私保护,Vec2Text,NLP,信息检索

TL;DR: 本文验证了Vec2Text框架在从文本嵌入重建原始文本的有效性，并提出了一些隐私保护措施。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统认为传输文本嵌入可以保护隐私，但Vec2Text证明嵌入可被解码还原原始文本，引发隐私担忧。

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架并扩展实验，验证其效果及隐私风险，探索噪声和量化技术的防御作用。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下能有效重建文本，但对输入长度敏感；噪声和量化技术可缓解隐私风险。

Conclusion: 文本嵌入的隐私风险需重视，需进一步研究防御机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

Motivation: 由于并非所有标记对模型性能的贡献均等，因此需要一种更精细的策略来优化对齐过程。

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型之间的标记级对数概率差异，优先选择高影响标记进行对齐。

Result: 在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中，Selective-DPO方法表现优于标准DPO和基于蒸馏的基线方法。

Conclusion: 标记级优化和参考模型选择对提升大语言模型的偏好对齐效果至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

TL;DR: StreamUni 通过统一的语音-语言大模型（LSLM）实现流式语音翻译（StreamST），利用语音思维链（CoT）指导模型生成多阶段输出，无需依赖分割模型或大量策略训练，实验表现领先。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有流式语音翻译方法依赖句子级分割模型，导致翻译模型因上下文受限而难以学习有效策略。

Method: 提出 StreamUni，结合语音 CoT 指导 LSLM 生成多阶段输出，完成语音分割、策略决策和翻译生成；并提出流式 CoT 训练方法。

Result: 实验显示 StreamUni 在流式语音翻译任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni 通过统一模型和 CoT 机制解决了流式翻译中的分割和策略学习问题，显著提升效果。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的解码器模型，用于反转Signal Temporal Logic (STL)公式的语义嵌入，以生成简洁有效的逻辑表达式。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 将符号知识集成到数据驱动学习算法中需要语义一致的连续表示，而此类表示必须是可逆的才能实现具体需求。

Method: 训练一个Transformer解码器模型，反转STL公式的语义嵌入，并评估其在复杂度和泛化能力上的表现。

Result: 模型在1个周期内即可生成有效公式，10个周期内泛化逻辑语义，并能生成更简洁的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了需求挖掘任务，直接在语义空间中优化STL分类问题。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Conclusion: 需要重新思考指令微调的损失函数设计，WIT为开发更鲁棒、泛化能力更强的模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Method: 使用固定源语言分词器，学习一个目标语言分词器，使其最大化跨语言语义对齐。

Result: 在语言建模中降低了困惑度，但机器翻译质量未提升。条件概率估计的二次扩展可能成为数据效率瓶颈。

Conclusion: 需要替代的参数化方法来改进跨语言分词的实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Motivation: RAG在NLP中表现出色，但检索文档中的共指复杂性会引入歧义，影响上下文学习，因此研究其影响旨在优化RAG系统。

Method: 通过比较不同池化策略在检索任务中的表现，并分析共指消解对问答任务的影响，特别是不同规模模型的性能差异。

Result: 共指消解提升了检索效果；平均池化策略表现最佳；小模型在歧义消除中受益更多。

Conclusion: 共指复杂性是RAG的重要挑战，共指消解能显著改进检索和生成，尤适用于知识密集型AI应用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Method: DocCHA将诊断过程分为三个阶段：症状引出、历史获取和因果图构建，每个阶段使用可解释的置信分数指导问题。

Result: 在中文咨询数据集上，DocCHA诊断准确率提升5.18%，症状召回率提升30%，对话轮次增加有限。

Conclusion: DocCHA实现了结构化、透明且高效的诊断对话，为多语言和资源受限环境下的可信临床助手铺平道路。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Method: 结合Gemini 2.0 Flash、Python脚本和Selenium网络自动化，通过CHARMM GUI生成NAMD模拟输入文件。

Result: 该流程减少了设置时间、降低了手动错误，并能并行处理多个蛋白质系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算结构生物学中LLMs的广泛应用提供了基础，展示了模拟自动化的潜力。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Motivation: 文本数据的爆炸式增长带来了分析动态主题和趋势的挑战，现有工具缺乏统一的解释性和用户友好探索支持。

Method: 开发了DTECT系统，结合LLM驱动自动标记、时间显著性词汇分析、交互式可视化和自然语言查询界面。

Result: DTECT显著提升了主题模型的解释性和用户体验，支持用户更有效地追踪和理解主题动态。

Conclusion: DTECT通过统一平台整合多项功能，解决了动态主题建模中的解释性和用户体验问题。

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end
system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal
insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在工业异常检测中存在解释性差和泛化能力不足的问题，需要更精确和上下文感知的分析方法。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，结合SFE和E-DPO技术，并引入AD-PL数据集和MLE评估框架。

Result: SAGE在零样本和少样本设定下在工业异常数据集上表现优越。

Conclusion: SAGE通过领域知识增强和偏好优化解决了现有模型的局限，提升了工业异常检测的性能。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIRIX，一种模块化多智能体记忆系统，通过六种结构化记忆类型和多智能体框架，解决了AI记忆能力的核心挑战，并在多模态和单模态任务中表现出显著优势。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的AI记忆系统通常局限于单一模态和狭窄的记忆范围，无法实现个性化、抽象化和可靠的信息回忆。MIRIX旨在通过多模态和结构化记忆设计，解决这些限制。

Method: MIRIX由六种记忆类型（核心、情景、语义、程序、资源记忆和知识库）组成，结合多智能体框架动态控制记忆的更新和检索，支持对长期用户数据的持久化和推理。

Result: MIRIX在多模态任务ScreenshotVQA中准确率比基线高35%，存储需求减少99.9%；在单模态任务LOCOMO中达到85.4%的最新性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX为增强语言模型的记忆能力设定了新的标准，未来有望在更广泛的实际场景中应用。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

Key words: reward models, generalization gap, language models, implicit bias

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型中隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）之间的泛化差距，发现IM-RM更依赖表层特征导致泛化较差。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究IM-RM与EX-RM的泛化差距的根本原因，探索不同奖励模型的隐式偏差。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM和EX-RM的泛化性能差异，排除其他可能假说。

Result: IM-RM因依赖表层特征泛化较差，尤其是在分布偏移或任务难度高时表现更差。

Conclusion: 设计选择（如奖励计算方式）会显著影响奖励模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在临床决策中的应用增加，确保透明和可信的推理至关重要。但现有评估方法在准确性和可扩展性上存在不足，缺乏严格的基准。

Method: 通过构建包含500个专家标注问题的MedThink-Bench，并提出LLM-w-Ref评估框架，结合细粒度推理和LLM-as-a-Judge机制进行评测。

Result: 实验表明，LLM-w-Ref与专家评估结果高度一致；较小的模型（如MedGemma-27B）在医学推理上能超越更大的专有模型（如OpenAI-o3）。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为评估大语言模型的医学推理提供了一种可靠工具，有助于推动其在临床实践中的安全和负责任应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法的工具集和工作流固定，限制了模型的灵活性和任务适配性。

Method: 开发PyVision框架，支持MLLMs自主生成、执行和优化Python工具，并分析工具使用情况。

Result: PyVision显著提升模型性能，如GPT-4.1和Claude-4.0-Sonnet在多个基准测试中表现提升。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成使模型更具自主性，推动了视觉推理的进步。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

Motivation: 探索前沿语言模型在简单推理任务上的表现，揭示其局限性和失败原因。

Method: 通过程序生成一系列简单推理任务（如计数、一阶逻辑等），并引入'解谜数据集'作为额外基准。

Result: 模型在简单任务上失败率高，尤其当任务计算量增加或问题被简化时，表现出统计捷径、中间步骤错误等系统性失败模式。

Conclusion: 前沿语言模型在简单任务上的表现仍有不足，任务简化并不总能提升模型性能。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

Conclusion: 该方法为AI开发提供了生物启发式的模块化和增量扩展新范式，推动了高效扩展和持续学习的可能。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Result: FashionBLIP-2结合FACap预训练在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ基准上表现优异，尤其在细粒度文本检索中。

Conclusion: FACap和FashionBLIP-2为时尚CIR提供了有效解决方案，适用于高要求的电子商务场景。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

Motivation: 机器遗忘（MU）是一种成本效益高的方法，用于从扩散模型中清除不需要的信息，但其效果难以验证且可能损害模型性能。

Method: autoeval-dmun利用语言模型提取目标概念的相关知识，识别可能被损害的概念，并生成对抗性提示以绕过遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型能有效排序相关概念，并生成绕过遗忘的对抗性提示。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun为评估和优化机器遗忘提供了自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有的GNN方法在链接预测中未能有效捕捉节点对之间的子图结构信息，导致预测准确性不足。

Method: SP4LP首先用GNN为所有节点生成表示，然后提取候选节点对的最短路径，并通过序列模型处理节点嵌入序列。

Result: SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，并理论上证明其表达能力更强。

Conclusion: SP4LP是一个通用且高效的链接预测方法，能有效捕捉多跳关系模式。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Conclusion: 稀疏适配器是模块化架构的有力候选，但需进一步优化以提升分布外性能。

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out

Conclusion: Str-GCL 首次直接整合结构常识到图对比学习中，显著提升了表示效果。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速增长导致推理成本高昂，部署障碍显著。现有的8位或4位量化方法在低于3位的条件下难以保持精度和效率。

Method: CCQ结合了硬件感知的位移编码解码技术、卷积码、混合编码和码簇，构建了一个无需查找的编码空间，实现代码本与权重向量的线性映射。

Result: 实验表明，CCQ在多个基准测试中表现优异，成功将DeepSeek-V3（671B参数）压缩至184GB，ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B压缩至89GB，并实现了单GPU部署。

Conclusion: CCQ是一种高效的低比特量化方法，显著降低了LLMs的部署成本。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）易受多轮越狱攻击，传统方法难以检测和缓解。

Method: 构建实体图以捕捉关键词之间的关系，并引入注意力感知增强机制增强分类能力。

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard能有效防御多轮越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的方法在生成文本描述时存在高可变性和低可靠性的问题，因此需要一种更高效、更可靠的方法来改进VLMs的提示学习。

Method: DeMul方法省去了提取文本描述的步骤，直接从LLM中蒸馏知识到提示中，并采用多提示学习和提示加权策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，DeMul在11个识别数据集上均表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeMul通过消除文本描述的依赖，提升了提示学习的效率和性能，为VLMs的适应性和鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

Motivation: 扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在局限性，如固定的源分布和有限的采样路径。流匹配技术提供了更快生成和更高质量的输出，但仍有潜力未被挖掘。

Method: CGFM通过整合辅助模型的输出和历史数据，构建双向条件概率路径，并使用一般仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明，CGFM在时间序列预测任务中持续优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过利用辅助模型的误差和扩展概率路径空间，显著推动了预测方法的发展。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Conclusion: DeCoLe为组织中数据管理提供了有效的误标记检测工具，提升数据可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Conclusion: 利用模型多样性能够更可靠地量化不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Conclusion: 研究强调了能源感知基准测试的重要性，为选择资源高效机制提供了实用见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Motivation: 理解每个特征对预测的贡献是机器学习模型的重要组成部分，但置换特征重要性在依赖特征存在时可能不可靠，因此需要一种方法检测其不可靠性。

Result: 在模拟数据和实际应用中验证了TRIP测试能够可靠地检测置换特征重要性分数的不可靠性。

Conclusion: TRIP测试为置换特征重要性提供了一种可靠的检测工具，尤其适用于高维数据。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model

non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL

and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL算法在集群联邦学习中表现出更高的效率和性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Conclusion: 研究强调了高级概率建模对强化IDS抵御生成模型驱动攻击的重要性。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

Abstract: PU (Positive Unlabeled) learning is a variant of supervised classification
learning in which the only labels revealed to the learner are of positively
labeled instances. PU learning arises in many real-world applications. Most
existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决现有方法在疾病分类中缺乏对群体特征一致性和共享病理依赖关系的整合的问题。

Method: 采用分层图神经网络框架ATHENA，整合临床特征和分子数据，优化患者特异性分子指纹。

Result: 在391名患者的数据集上，分类性能显著提升（AUC提高13%，F1分数提高20%）。

Conclusion: ATHENA通过可解释AI驱动的子网络聚类，为个性化干预策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 尽管基于人类偏好的奖励模型在强化学习人类反馈（RLHF）中表现优异，但仍易受奖励破解的影响。现有方法主要关注分布内场景，而在OOD场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出一种联合训练框架，结合Bradley-Terry单目标回归和多目标回归奖励模型，利用共享嵌入空间，理论分析两者的互补性。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分性能，7B模型甚至超越70B基线。

Conclusion: 联合训练单目标和多目标奖励模型是解决OOD奖励破解问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric

relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 由于分子动力学模拟中罕见事件（如状态转换）的直接观测困难，需要增强采样技术。现有机器学习方法在CV发现中未能充分编码动态细节，因此需要新的方法。

Method: TLC框架通过建模时间滞后条件分布而非静态Boltzmann分布，学习捕捉慢动态行为的CVs。实验在Alanine Dipeptide系统上进行，采用两种增强采样任务验证。

Result: TLC在转换路径采样和状态区分任务中表现出与现有MLCV方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: TLC框架通过直接学习时间滞后条件分布，有效捕捉了慢动态行为，为增强采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Result: 在公开数据集上，HGMP显著优于基线方法，并展现出良好的多任务适应性。

Conclusion: HGMP通过联合优化预训练与下游任务，解决了异构图领域中的任务适应性问题。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Result: 神经网络能够轻松找到这些表示，而经典有限电路无法实现。几何关系独立于网络架构。

Conclusion: 神经网络在预训练中自然地学习了对生成模型的信念表示，其几何关系具有普遍性。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中，任务间的目标差异可能导致负迁移，固定的Transformer结构和网络容量限制了其适应性。现有的动态网络架构效率低下，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出DTME-MTL，通过在令牌空间中识别梯度冲突并基于冲突类型应用自适应解决方案，避免参数冗余的同时提升适应性。

Result: 实验表明，DTME-MTL能以最小的计算开销持续提升多任务性能，具有可扩展性和高效性。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为提升Transformer多任务学习模型提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Result: 研究发现，CSP-LDA和MDRM-T提供了最佳的不确定性估计，而Deep Ensembles和CNN的分类效果最好。所有模型均能区分难易样本，从而通过拒绝模糊样本提高BCI的准确性。

Conclusion: 结论表明，传统方法在不确定性量化上表现优异，结合样本拒绝策略可进一步提升BCI性能。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Motivation: PVGs在非线性分类模型中提供了可验证性，但尚未应用于高维图像等复杂输入；CBMs能将数据转化为可解释概念，但受限于线性预测器。

Method: 通过最小监督概念发现模型提取结构化概念编码，用非线性预测器实现验证。

Result: NCV在高维逻辑复杂数据集中优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器。

Conclusion: NCV是实现高性能、可验证AI的重要一步。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出色，对高维数据的鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果与计算效率之间取得平衡，为实时异常检测设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Result: 方法收敛于期望近似，并推导出明确的误差边界。

Conclusion: 新方法克服了现有技术的数值缺陷，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 由于职业定义在不同企业和国家间存在差异，需要一种方法映射O*NET数据库中不同任务定义的职业。

Method: 使用基于BERT的技术结合多种聚类方法，并探讨降维方法对聚类性能的影响。

Result: 通过改进的轮廓方法提升了聚类结果。

Conclusion: 新的聚类映射方法结合降维技术可自动区分职业，为职业转换提供帮助。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，SLOGAN显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SLOGAN为图领域自适应提供了一种稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在EEG数据上泛化能力差，受限于高受试者间变异性，需要开发更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 提出TransformEEG模型，采用深度卷积分词器生成通道特定特征，改进Transformer编码器中的自注意力层特征融合。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上测试，TransformEEG的平衡准确率中位数最高（78.45%），结合数据增强和阈值校正后提升至80.10%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在EEG数据上表现更稳定，变异性更低，检测帕金森病的可靠性优于现有模型。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在敏感领域中，传统联邦学习（FL）依赖中心服务器，存在单点故障和隐私风险，而拆分学习（SL）虽保护隐私但扩展性差。因此，需要一种既能保护隐私又可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 论文结合FSL与HLF，利用HLF的瞬时字段和私有数据集合（PDCs）实现去中心化的模型执行和聚合，避免中心协调器。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST基准测试中，HLF-FSL在保持准确性的同时，降低了每轮训练时间，并证明了其企业级可行性。

Conclusion: HLF-FSL提供了一种隐私保护、可扩展且高效的企业级协作机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

Motivation: 探索深度神经网络中ReLU激活层对输入变化的子空间的影响，以理解其表达能力的动态行为。

Method: 通过固定输入批次和随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵期望秩的闭式表达式，并分析其几何衰减和振荡现象。

Result: 期望秩呈现几何衰减（比例为≈0.3634），并在特定深度出现局部峰值（高度≈0.79m），同时证明这是有限宽度的现象。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层交替压缩和部分恢复输入变化的子空间，为深度网络的表达能力提供了新的定量洞察。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

Conclusion: FedCBDR 通过类平衡和温度动态调整显著提升了联邦类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在10个安全领域测试多种模型（如Mistral-7b、GPT-4），揭示行为模式和鲁棒性差异。

Conclusion: GuardVal为LLM安全性评估提供更全面视角，促进未来安全模型的研究与开发。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种稳健且实用的解决方案，能够更详细地理解处理效应的异质性。

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Result: OPC在图像分类遗忘任务中表现出色，能有效抵抗恢复攻击和数据重建攻击，实现深度特征遗忘。

Conclusion: OPC的深度遗忘特性提升了遗忘方法的鲁棒性，凸显了改进现有遗忘技术的必要性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法忽视类别间脆弱性差异，导致部分类别易受攻击。TRIX旨在通过针对性调整训练策略，提高整体公平性。

Method: TRIX为强类别分配较弱的目标对抗样本，弱类别分配更强的无目标对抗样本，并结合损失加权和扰动强度调整。

Result: 在标准数据集上，TRIX显著提高了最差类别准确率，减少了类别间鲁棒性差异，同时保持整体性能。

Conclusion: TRIX是实现公平且有效对抗防御的实用方法。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Conclusion: S4T通过同步多任务处理，有效提升了模型在多任务场景下的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 新的空间填充正则化方法能够显著改善状态空间中的数据分布，提升训练效果和模型可解释性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Conclusion: 本文通过精确的Lipschitz边界和JaSMin正则化，为理解并提升Transformer的鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Conclusion: 预训练模型的准确性对顺序决策任务至关重要，模型弹性可作为评估和提升其应用效果的核心指标。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Conclusion: 通过平方根参数化方法，为自然梯度变分推断的理论收敛提供了新的保证。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Abstract: Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to the modern economy,

surpasses traditional and other GNN baselines, with AUCs of 0.995 and 0.701 for
supply chain mining and default prediction, respectively. It also helps
regulators model supply chain disruption impacts on banks, accurately
forecasting loan defaults from material shortages, and offers Federal Reserve

Conclusion: 理解DPO的理论基础有助于识别其潜在问题，并为未来的优化提供方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Result: 模型在活性预测和新分子设计上优于现有方法，并对无数据的新病原体具有良好迁移性。

Conclusion: ApexOracle为对抗耐药性问题提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Conclusion: SAMO是一种高效的多任务优化方法，能够显著缓解任务冲突。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Conclusion: 无结构化推理时剪枝是一种实用解决方案，适用于微控制器上高效、无需重新训练的深度神经网络部署。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT

into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）带来的隐私、版权和数据管理风险日益突出，需要更高效的方法来理解和控制这些风险。

Method: 提出一种新攻击方法，基于域知识，利用电商平台的数据模式，通过看似无害的提示词重建图像。

Result: 成功识别出能够无意中重建真实图像的提示词（如“蓝色中性T恤”），展示了模型的潜在风险。

Conclusion: 生成模型在数据处理和提示设计上存在根本性漏洞，需要更严格的隐私保护措施。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 尽管语言模型近年来取得巨大进步，但预处理步骤（如分词）仍是实现真正端到端基础模型的障碍。论文旨在消除这一障碍。

Method: 引入动态分块机制，结合显式分层网络（H-Net），实现完全端到端学习。分块策略与模型联合学习。

Result: H-Net在字节级别表现优于基于BPE分词的Transformer模型，且随着数据规模增加性能提升更显著，对中文和代码等任务效果尤为突出。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了从未处理数据中学习和扩展的真正端到端模型的潜力，尤其在分词启发式较弱的情况下。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Conclusion: 前瞻性学习框架的扩展和改进为动态数据分布和变化目标提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在离线到在线的RL设置中，如何有效利用离线数据以提升在线学习的样本效率是一个核心挑战。Q-chunking旨在通过动作分块技术解决这一问题。

Method: Q-chunking将动作分块技术应用于TD-based RL方法，直接在分块动作空间中进行RL训练，从而利用离线数据中的时间一致行为，并支持更稳定的多步TD学习。

Result: 在实验中，Q-chunking展现了优越的离线性能和在线样本效率，优于现有的离线到在线方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking通过动作分块技术显著提升了离线到在线RL的性能，尤其是在长时程、稀疏奖励任务中。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Result: 在样本效率上，EXPO比现有方法提升2-3倍，适用于预训练策略微调和离线数据训练的场景。

Conclusion: EXPO有效解决了高表达策略在在线强化学习中的稳定优化问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

Conclusion: 结论指出固定架构的局限性，并展示了动态深度调整在推理中的潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，LLMs可以统一高层符号规划和低层连续控制，为化学工程中的语言驱动自动化铺平道路。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Result: BOOST方法在保持高性能的同时提升了公平性，有效减少了艺术分类中的偏见。

Conclusion: BOOST为AI艺术分类中的偏见问题提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，兼顾性能和公平性。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Conclusion: ViDove为多模态翻译提供了高效方法，并推出新基准DoveBench。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

*Sarah Ball,Greg Gluch,Shafi Goldwasser,Frauke Kreuter,Omer Reingold,Guy N. Rothblum*

Key words: 大型语言模型、安全对齐、输入过滤、输出过滤、计算挑战

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全对齐问题，重点关注输入和输出过滤的有效性，发现计算挑战阻碍了高效过滤的实现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其可能被滥用于生成有害内容的担忧增加，研究旨在探索如何通过过滤机制防止不安全信息的生成。

Method: 研究分析了输入提示和输出内容的过滤可行性，通过理论证明计算挑战的存在，并基于密码学假设验证了过滤的局限性。

Result: 研究发现，高效的输入和输出过滤在计算上是不可行的，提示外部过滤机制不足以确保模型的安全性。

Conclusion: 安全不能仅依赖外部过滤，需要对LLM的内部结构（架构和权重）进行设计，表明AI系统的智能与判断不可分割。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 供应链运输中的高响应性和经济效益是关键目标，但受航运模式战略决策影响大。需要一个可观察、低风险的环境来设计运输策略。

Method: 提出 Sim-to-Dec 框架，包括利用自回归建模的生成模拟模块和通过端到端优化迭代改进的历史-未来双感知决策模型。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Sim-to-Dec 显著提高了及时交付率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec 是一个通用且高效的框架，适用于复杂供应链运输策略的设计。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在科学领域（如药物发现）展现出潜力，但其推理能力受限于预训练知识。传统方法如微调或检索增强生成存在计算开销大或未能充分利用结构化科学数据的问题。

Method: 提出DrugMCTS框架，通过五个专用智能体检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息，实现结构化迭代推理，结合RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在DrugBank和KIBA数据集上的实验表明，DrugMCTS显著提高了召回率和鲁棒性，性能超过通用LLM和深度学习基线模型20%以上。

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动搜索机制对提升大语言模型在药物发现中的应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有的基准测试很少同时评估AI代理的生产活动和社会互动能力，因此需要一种新的测试环境来填补这一空白。

Method: StarDojo设计了一个统一的用户友好界面，支持多操作系统和并行环境实例执行，特别适合评估基于多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）的代理。

Result: 对现有MLLMs代理的评估显示，性能最佳的GPT-4.1成功率仅12.7%，主要由于视觉理解、多模态推理和低级操作方面的挑战。

Conclusion: StarDojo旨在促进在复杂生产生活环境中开发更强大的开放式代理研究。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Conclusion: AlgEval为LLM的算法解释提供新方向，支持高效训练和新型架构设计。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Method: 论文开发了算法来分析规则模型中的负面特征（如负面重叠和多种形式的冗余）。

Result: 研究发现，常用工具学到的规则集普遍存在一种或多种负面特征。

Conclusion: 在高风险应用中，规则模型的设计需要更严格的验证以避免负面特征。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Conclusion: Context Pooling是一种通用且高效的GNN增强方法，显著提升了链接预测的准确性。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Result: 发现当前模型在浅层查询中表现良好，但在模拟物理约束和空间一致性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: PlanQA突显了大型语言模型在现实布局推理中的盲点，希望推动相关研究的进步。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Motivation: 尽管DPO在语言模型对齐方面取得了实证成功，但其理论性质和内在限制尚未充分研究，尤其是在初始化和概率分配方面的敏感性。

Method: 通过概率演化视角分析DPO的动态性，并提出一个基于双层优化的稳定偏好优化框架，结合监督微调和增强的DPO目标。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新思路，并为更可靠和可解释的语言模型对齐开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 历史上，小提琴制造标准的变化导致了一些乐器的尺寸缩减，这种缩减影响了乐器的轮廓线特征。然而，这种差异尚未被量化研究，因此论文试图填补这一空白。

Method: 研究团队使用摄影测量技术获取25把小提琴的3D几何网格，提取每把乐器10-20条等距轮廓线，并通过抛物线拟合提取参数（如开口度和垂直拉伸度），最终构建每把乐器的数值特征。

Result: 研究发现，基于几何特征的分类方法能够在一定程度上区分缩减和非缩减乐器，其中开口度参数是最具预测性的指标。

Conclusion: 尽管存在部分乐器难以量化缩减程度的问题，但几何特征可以为小提琴的分类提供有效依据，尤其是在区分U形和V形轮廓线时。

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

Result: 测试的28个模型中，最高分72/100，但在信仰、品德和意义等维度表现较差。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark 为开发支持人类福祉的 AI 提供了框架，对 AI 伦理和评估有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models
achieving 72/100), none are acceptably aligned across all dimensions,
particularly in Faith and Spirituality, Character and Virtue, and Meaning and
Purpose. This research establishes a framework for developing AI systems that
actively support human flourishing rather than merely avoiding harm, offering
significant implications for AI development, ethics, and evaluation.

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

Key words: 自适应感知,可持续AI,小模型,传感器参数调整,多模态

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 当前AI依赖大模型和大数据的扩展，虽取得显著成果，但引发了环境、经济和伦理成本问题，限制了可持续性和公平性。生物感知系统的动态适应性启发了这一研究。

Method: 提出自适应感知方法，动态调整传感器参数（如曝光、灵敏度、多模态配置）以减少协变量偏移并提升效率。基于实证研究，小模型通过自适应感知可超越大模型表现。

Result: 自适应感知使小模型（如EfficientNet-B0）超越大模型（如OpenCLIP-H），显著减少数据和计算需求。

Conclusion: 论文规划了自适应感知在多个领域的应用路径，并评估技术和伦理挑战，提出研究方向，旨在推动可持续、鲁棒且公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Method: 提出了一组多项式复杂度的算法，能够适应不同类别的系统（如非布尔、黑盒和随机系统），并通过调整计算时间来提高精度和全面性。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Method: 通过固定分布的下一个token目标模型，分析计算资源的边际收益递减效应，并用基准数据和理论模型验证训练损失差异对能力的重要性。

Result: 计算规模扩张的收益递减效应足够强，即使是计算资源增长较慢的组织，其模型性能也将逐渐接近大型模型。

Conclusion: 小型模型能力的提升将改变AI战略和政策，需要重新审视相关领域的影响。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Method: 分析200k匿名用户与Microsoft Bing Copilot的对话数据，结合职业活动的分类和任务成功及影响的测量，计算各职业的AI适用性分数。

Result: 最常见的AI辅助工作活动是信息收集和写作，而AI自身主要执行提供信息、写作、教学和咨询任务。知识工作职业（如计算机和数学、办公室支持、销售）AI适用性最高。

Conclusion: AI在信息驱动和高教育水平的职业中适用性较强，实际使用情况与职业AI影响的预测存在关联。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.MM

Motivation: 解决脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在大规模语音处理任务中因多时间步脉冲发射导致的高计算开销及缺乏专用架构的问题。

Method: 引入输入感知多级脉冲（IMLS）机制模拟多时间步脉冲发射，并设计HD-RepSSA模块增强注意力图精度和多尺度时序依赖建模。

Result: 在AiShell-1和Librispeech-960数据集上分别达到6.0%和3.4%的词错误率，理论推理能耗降低4.64倍和4.32倍。

Conclusion: IML-Spikeformer在性能和能效上均表现出色，推动了大规模语音处理任务中SNN架构的发展。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms,
represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers
energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve
competitive performance on large-scale speech processing task. Two key
challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training
caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN
architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we
introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking
Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech
processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)
mechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep
using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further
integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a
Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module
enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale
temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that
IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on
Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing
theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$
respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures
for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy
efficiency.

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 摄影收藏的快速增长超越手动编目能力，促使研究利用VLM自动生成元数据，以探索AI在档案和博物馆编目中的潜在应用。

Method: 使用InternVL2 VLM为考古照片生成目录描述，通过专家和非专家的评估框架，参与者分类描述来源、评价质量并反馈对AI工具的信任和接受度。

Result: 参与者分类AI生成描述的性能高于随机水平，但低估了自己的检测能力。OCR错误和幻觉影响质量感知，高准确性的描述更难分类。专家对AI工具的接受度较低。

Conclusion: AI可作为辅助工具生成草稿，但需人类审核以确保准确性和专业性。成功的整合依赖于技术改进（如领域优化）和建立信任（如透明化流程）。

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual
cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate
metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue
descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might
integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM
(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on
labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and
archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental
framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or
expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI
tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups
underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors
and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in
accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review
is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions
generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like
archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,
emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.
These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft
generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment
with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful
integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such
as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among
professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and
explainable AI pipeline.

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 现有的神经音频编解码器和自编码器通常仅优化重建保真度，而忽略了特定下游任务所需的潜在空间结构，这限制了其在多样化应用中的性能。

Method: 引入\'Re-Bottleneck\'框架，通过在预训练自编码器的瓶颈层施加潜在空间损失来定制用户定义的结构。

Result: 实验显示，该方法实现了1）潜在通道的排序，2）潜在空间与语义嵌入的对齐，3）输入波形与潜在空间操作的等变性，同时不影响重建质量。

Conclusion: \'Re-Bottleneck\'提供了一种高效灵活的方式，为神经音频模型的潜在表示定制化需求提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for
audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space
generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize
reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure
necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We
propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the
bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a
"Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space
losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent
channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents
with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion
modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation
on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the
latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and
efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them
to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal
additional training.

Conclusion: 这些结果为在低功耗、常开的边缘设备上优化ASR模型提供了有价值的见解，展示了量化技术的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have demonstrated
remarkable accuracy and robustness in diverse audio applications, such as live
transcription and voice command processing. However, deploying these models on
resource constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT device, wearables) still presents
substantial challenges due to strict limits on memory, compute and power.
Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an
effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining.
Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced
quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear.
In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art
(SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and
Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy,
memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR
leaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on
both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression
toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced
quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline,
and detailed analysis tools. Our results characterize the trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that even 3-bit quantization can succeed
on high capacity models when using advanced PTQ techniques. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power, always-on
edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 传统推荐算法无法处理用户通过文本表达的个人偏好，LLM的出现为解决这一问题提供了新工具。

Method: 结合SVD或SVD++算法与LLM，通过MovieLens数据集训练，并使用留一验证和分层测试评估性能。

Result: LLM增强框架在各项评估指标上显著优于传统算法（如累积命中率提升6倍，NDCG提升3.7倍），但计算成本略有增加。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效提升个性化推荐系统的性能，尤其是结合用户文本偏好时。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

Key words: PET-CT, 病灶分割, 双提示驱动, 多任务学习, 生存分析

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DpDNet的双提示驱动网络，用于PET-CT病灶分割，通过特定提示和通用提示结合，提升了多癌症类型分割的性能，并展现了在乳腺癌生存分析中的潜力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 现有方法将多癌症病灶分割视为单一任务，未考虑不同癌症类型的独特性。

Method: DpDNet网络结合特定提示和通用提示，并采用提示感知头来适应多分割任务。

Result: 在包含四种癌症类型的PET-CT数据上，DpDNet表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: DpDNet可成为个性化风险分层的有效工具，辅助临床优化治疗策略。

Abstract: PET-CT lesion segmentation is challenging due to noise sensitivity, small and
variable lesion morphology, and interference from physiological high-metabolic
signals. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network
solving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as
a single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different
cancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers
in terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity,
we propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific
prompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared
knowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early
introduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to
adaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset
with four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models.
Finally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax
for breast cancer survival analysis. The results suggest that DpDNet has the
potential to serve as a valuable tool for personalized risk stratification,
supporting clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving
outcomes. Code is available at https://github.com/XinglongLiang08/DpDNet.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 无线定位与感知技术在现代无线网络中至关重要，但MIMO-OFDM系统中高维CSI特性的联合建模研究不足。本文旨在探索二者的协同潜力。

Method: 将定位与感知建模为混合整数双层深度学习问题，提出SPG-MIBO算法，利用随机近端梯度和小批量训练处理高维大规模数据。

Result: 多数据集实验表明SPG-MIBO具有计算和内存效率，且性能优于单独优化定位或感知的方法。

Conclusion: SPG-MIBO算法有效解决了高维数据集中的联合优化问题，为无线网络中的定位与感知任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern
wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing
systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent
applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the
spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the
frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of
localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of
MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to
jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their
potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a
mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic
proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)
algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale
datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and
memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence
guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its
effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and
sensing optimization.

Motivation: 解决移动和边缘设备上深度学习训练中的内存限制问题，尤其是激活数据占用的内存。

Result: 内存使用减少22.9倍，速度提升3.2倍，同时保持模型精度。

Conclusion: DAF是一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have
underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome
the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate
memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation,
compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research
challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise
theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by
system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory
fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework
that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level
optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic
quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid
reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge
SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic
quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management
scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory
savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations
on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms
demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$
speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: New discoveries in chemistry and materials science, with increasingly

unique opportunities for machine learning (ML) to take critical roles in
accelerating research efficiency. Here, we demonstrate (1) the use of large

LLM-based literature review tool (LMExt) successfully extracted chemical
information and beyond into a machine-readable structure, including stability
constants for metal cation-ligand interactions, thermodynamic properties, and
other broader data types (medical research papers, and financial reports),
effectively overcoming the challenges inherent in each domain. Using the
autonomous acquisition of thermodynamic data, an ML model was trained using the
CatBoost algorithm for accurately predicting thermodynamic parameters (e.g.,
enthalpy of formation) of minerals. This work highlights the transformative
potential of integrated ML approaches to reshape chemistry and materials

TL;DR: 该论文评估了两种时间序列基础模型（TTM和Chronos）在金融时间序列预测中的表现，发现预训练模型TTM在数据有限时表现显著优于未经训练的模型，尽管传统专业模型在某些任务中仍更具优势。

<details>

Main category: q-fin.GN

Motivation: 解决金融时间序列预测中由于非线性关系、时间依赖性和数据稀缺性带来的挑战，探索时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的潜力。

Method: 通过对比预训练的TTM和未经训练的模型在三个金融预测任务（美国国债收益率变化、欧元/美元波动性、股票价差预测）中的表现，评估TSFMs的泛化能力和样本效率。

Result: 预训练的TTM在有限数据下表现优于未经训练的模型25-50%，零样本性能优于简单基准模型；但传统专业模型在两任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: TSFMs在数据稀缺的金融预测任务中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以适应金融时间序列特性。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to
complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable
interdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks
involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market
assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution
through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific
adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)
across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,
EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM
exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version
of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained
version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and
15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's
zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting
and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can
surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model
consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable
performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant
sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,
traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of
three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific
optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer
substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy,
data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires
domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial
time series characteristics.

Motivation: 现有的三维分子生成器在任务间分散，存在片段化问题，需要通过统一框架提升任务对齐和零样本转移能力。

Method: 引入了MODA，采用贝叶斯掩码调度器，在训练中对连续的片段进行掩码和去噪，学习跨任务的几何和化学先验。

Result: MODA在子结构、化学性质、相互作用和几何性能上超越了六种扩散模型基线，且在零样本设计中表现出稳定的负Vina分数和高改进率。

Conclusion: 单阶段多任务扩散方法可以取代两阶段工作流，为基于结构的分子设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now
reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks.
SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and
one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment,
and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies
fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration
with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment
is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared
geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a
universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training
paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry.
Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while
maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but
trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and
lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high
improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate
that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage
workflows for structure-based molecular design.

Abstract: Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are
restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness
within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of
gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this
study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of
biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner
spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data,
literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To
distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we
devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis
(SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different
data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings
capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of
embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for
Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a
machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these
heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated
this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated
consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in
missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling
of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable
multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning
applications.

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable
sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants.
To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of
semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for
data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage
of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic
evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public,
private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental
basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource
consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The
results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing
semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public
auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on
the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data
sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了重新设计通信框架和网络拓扑的必要性。

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high
performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like
AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth
and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss,
thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze
these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources
depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry
out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide
variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we
instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for
richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration
parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as
parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and
discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the
open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and
count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our
analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication
frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network
anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.DC

Motivation: 随着LLMs扩展到数百万token的KV历史记录，实时自回归解码在严格的Token-to-Token延迟约束下面临FFN权重读取和长KV缓存访问的瓶颈。

Method: 提出了Helix Parallelism，通过KV并行分片KV缓存并在FFN计算时重用GPU进行TP或EP并行，同时引入轻量级通信步骤和Helix HOP-B技术以减少通信开销。

Result: Helix在固定批量大小下将TTL降低1.5倍，支持32倍大的批量处理，提升了Blackwell平台的吞吐量-延迟Pareto前沿。

Conclusion: Helix Parallelism为超长序列的实时推理提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive
decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing
pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps
mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.
When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV
duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,
DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further
capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV
parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the
same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN
computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight
communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce
Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through
batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared
to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at

Key words: 分布式训练，不可靠连接，梯度聚合，模型收敛

Main category: cs.DC

Motivation: 现有分布式框架依赖可靠连接，导致延迟和扩展性问题。利用不可靠连接可能牺牲模型准确性。本文旨在解决这一关键问题。

Method: 采用两阶段防御机制：(1) 无偏梯度聚合，从到达的数据包重建梯度；(2) 有界漂移参数广播，证明模型差异有界。

Result: 在LLAMA2 7B模型上实验，容忍10%数据包丢失时，困惑度变化最多0.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了高效通信协议与现代大模型训练需求之间的鸿沟，支持在普通或广域网上进行稳健训练。

Abstract: State-of-the-art language and vision models are routinely trained across
thousands of GPUs, often spanning multiple data-centers, yet today's
distributed frameworks still assume reliable connections (e.g., InfiniBand or
RoCE). The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail
latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce
latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are
dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and
convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.
We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training
framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased
gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code
or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages:
(i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent
gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level
correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the
inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many
iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups.
Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64
GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change.
This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols
and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model
training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area
networks.

*Zihan Zhang,Leon Wong,Blesson Varghese*

Key words: 联邦学习, 计算效率, 通信开销, 非IID数据, Ampere

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Ampere的新型协作训练系统，旨在解决联邦学习中的设备计算成本和通信开销问题，同时提高模型准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.DC

Motivation: 现有Split Federated Learning（SFL）系统虽减轻设备计算负担，但引入高通信开销并降低模型准确性，尤其对非独立同分布（non-IID）数据效果不佳。因此，需要一种兼顾计算效率、通信效率和准确性的新方法。

Method: Ampere采用单向块间训练和本地损失函数，消除梯度传输，通过轻量级辅助网络生成方法减少通信和计算开销，并整合设备生成的激活以减少数据异质性影响。

Result: 实验表明，Ampere在多个模型上显著优于SFL基线：准确率提升最高13.26%，训练时间减少94.6%，通信开销降低99.1%，计算成本减少93.13%，非IID数据下的准确率标准差降低53.39%。

Conclusion: Ampere在保持低计算和通信开销的同时，显著提高了模型准确性，尤其在处理异质数据时表现优异。

Abstract: A Federated Learning (FL) system collaboratively trains neural networks
across devices and a server but is limited by significant on-device computation
costs. Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a
block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing
so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of
intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and
reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel
collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device
computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.
Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere
develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device
and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A
lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the
device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single
transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere
mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations
generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to
SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive
experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to
state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up
to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces
device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation
by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for
various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with
heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Computational models have become one of the prevalent methods to model
complex phenomena. To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed
biomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised
of several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from
microscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between
different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the
advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling
that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and
a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale
studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the
workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating
at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale
Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow
management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond
to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called
"mini-MuMMI". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on
modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems.
We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions
and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale
workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of
applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in
financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints
such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a
mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often
struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like
Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its
classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We
demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios
comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence
on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis
applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing
universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm
on portfolio optimization problems.

Conclusion: PAOA是一种有效且可扩展的优化方法，能够优于传统方法如QAOA和模拟退火，在复杂问题上具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends
and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling
parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic
computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of
binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples.
We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the
gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a
principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting
case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an
FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D
spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior
performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing
by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance
over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.

Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

Abstract: Decisions about managing patients on the heart transplant waitlist are
currently made by committees of doctors who consider multiple factors, but the
process remains largely ad-hoc. With the growing volume of longitudinal
patient, donor, and organ data collected by the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS) since 2018, there is increasing interest in analytical
approaches to support clinical decision-making at the time of organ
availability. In this study, we benchmark machine learning models that leverage
longitudinal waitlist history data for time-dependent, time-to-event modeling
of waitlist mortality. We train on 23,807 patient records with 77 variables and
evaluate both survival prediction and discrimination at a 1-year horizon. Our
best model achieves a C-Index of 0.94 and AUROC of 0.89, significantly
outperforming previous models. Key predictors align with known risk factors
while also revealing novel associations. Our findings can support urgency
assessment and policy refinement in heart transplant decision making.

Conclusion: MM2IM显著优化了TCONV在边缘设备上的性能，速度和能效优于现有方法。

Abstract: Transposed Convolutions (TCONV) enable the up-scaling mechanism within
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, the predominant
Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output
mapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies
further exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on
resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we
propose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix
Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on
resource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design
toolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV
problem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a
dual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance
of MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving
up to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV
accelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate
MM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x
energy reduction against the CPU baseline.

Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new
hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a
variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole
structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce
similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is
especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is
limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning
approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is
based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on
predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while
discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on
synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously
unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the
$P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole
structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the
presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While
evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to
other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure
inference in scattering amplitudes.

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify
uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage
probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods
for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple
observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction
time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen
science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by
individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into
conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label
set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The
approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each
observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these
p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring
function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this
distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as
majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a
particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that
facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through
user-submitted images.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from
persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the
information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams
is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however.
To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature
vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of
pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of
fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that
models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even
outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This
observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate
topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and
performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.

Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our
goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized
models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property
in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning
and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model
increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional
bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number
of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become
infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the
double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.
Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor
that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when
possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model
selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.

Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation
and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential
Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing
(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can
improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to
high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The
Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that
particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,
we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the
Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored
previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the
first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals
not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature
(second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on
synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size
selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other
proposals.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 传统ARIMA模型受限于线性假设，计算复杂度高，难以处理大规模复杂数据。

Method: 用Galerkin投影估计的样条函数替代ARIMA中的AR部分，保留MA分量和高斯噪声假设。

Result: 推导出Galerkin系数的闭式OLS估计，模型具有渐近无偏性和一致性，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Galerkin-ARIMA结合经典时间序列建模与非线性回归，提升预测性能与计算效率。

Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited
to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex
datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA
and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin
projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged
values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a
closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is
asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method
bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which
offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 现有N元组学习方法依赖任务特定设计，缺乏统一理论基础，因此提出通用框架以整合点未标记数据。

Result: 在四种代表性弱监督场景中验证了框架的灵活性，实验表明利用点未标记数据能持续提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为N元组学习提供了统一理论支持，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning
has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing
N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order
comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on
task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,
we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk
minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to
enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation
processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic
formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk
estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We
further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four
representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case
of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from
negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical
risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data
consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

Method: 提出PILOC框架，结合局部感知、通讯及信息素逆向引导机制，嵌入深度强化学习观测空间。

Result: 实验表明PILOC在搜索效率、适应性和系统鲁棒性上有显著提升，尤其在动态和通讯受限场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: PILOC为未来多智能体搜索救援应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

Motivation: 电缆驱动并联机器人在任务中需检测异常以确保安全，但现有方法可能依赖额外传感器，增加了复杂性。本文目标是仅通过电机转矩数据实现高效异常检测。

Method: 采用高斯混合模型（GMM）进行无监督异常检测，通过短暂校准期拟合模型，实时计算马氏距离并触发异常标志。模型参数动态更新以适应环境变化。

Result: 在14次长时间测试中，该方法实现了100%的准确率和95.4%的平均真阴性率，检测延迟为1秒，相比其他方法更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外传感器，可高效检测异常，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Conclusion: 该框架为软体机器人运动学建模提供了一种有效的不确定性量化方法，提升了模型精度。

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

Conclusion: 该方法的提出为AEBS验证框架提供了更可靠和可重复的途径，未来仍有优化和扩展的空间。

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

Main category: math.OC

Motivation: 探讨SGD和SHB在目标函数为凸或非凸时的收敛性能，避免使用复杂的Robbins-Siegmund定理或鞅收敛理论。

Method: 使用离散Gronwall不等式方法分析收敛速率，适用于目标函数梯度满足γ-Hölder条件的情况。

Result: 在非凸目标下，SGD和SHB的收敛速率为o(t^{p-1})；在凸目标下，收敛速率为o(t^{2γ/(1+γ)·max(p-1,-2p+1)-ϵ})。SHB在特定条件下可达O(t^{max(p-1,-2p+1)}log²(t/δ))的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 论文通过简化分析方法，证明了SGD和SHB在不同目标函数下的收敛性，为优化算法提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence rate for the last iterate of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) in the parametric
setting when the objective function $F$ is globally convex or non-convex whose
gradient is $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder. Using only discrete Gronwall's inequality
without Robbins-Siegmund theorem nor martingale convergence theory, we recover
results for both SGD and SHB: $\min_{s\leq t} \|\nabla F(w_s)\|^2 = o(t^{p-1})$
for non-convex objectives and $F(w_t) - F_* = o(t^{2\gamma/(1+\gamma) \cdot
\max(p-1,-2p+1)-\epsilon})$ for $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $\min_{s \leq t} F(w_s)
- F_* = o(t^{p-1})$ almost surely for convex objectives. In addition, we proved
that SHB with constant momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ attains a
convergence rate of $F(w_t) - F_* = O(t^{\max(p-1,-2p+1)} \log^2
\frac{t}{\delta})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ when $F$ is convex and
$\gamma = 1$ and step size $\alpha_t = \Theta(t^{-p})$ with $p \in

Main category: cs.GR

Motivation: 传统图像拼接方法在处理视差、光线和风格差异时会出现伪影，现有生成模型难以合成大范围连贯的全景图像。

Method: 通过微调扩散模型的修复能力，基于多幅参考图像保留场景内容和布局，实现全景图像的无缝生成。

Result: 在图像质量和场景一致性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了复杂条件下全景图像拼接的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple
reference images containing parallax effects and strong variations in lighting,
camera capture settings, or style. In this challenging setting, traditional
image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad
consequences for system ergodicity.

Conclusion: FedP3E通过原型驱动机制，实现了在不交换原始数据或梯度的情况下跨客户端共享表示，显著提升了模型在异构数据环境中的性能。

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have
become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware
attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of
IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both
privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)
offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without
exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx
often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and
non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint
malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E
(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports
indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.
Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact
summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to
clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based
augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than
relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables
clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns
observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.
This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity
with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset
under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

Conclusion: 研究发现，现有的提示注入防御在白盒设置下未能提供足够的安全性，为进一步研究此类防御的鲁棒性提供了基础。

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the
need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized
small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through
experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently
underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they
exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.
We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,
revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance
of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models
like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above
80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient
deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and
cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide
concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These
findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence
systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating
traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding
capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become
increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of
Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective
for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving
attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and
identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering
subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges
the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of
GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative
intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by
6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time
responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model
integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity
defences suited for modern connected environments.

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the
provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded
in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret
watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing}
attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not}
generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to
falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless}
watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected
success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses
on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a
black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to
mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking
method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and
demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less
effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of
watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and
model this threat via security games.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.SY

Motivation: 美国每年因计划外断电损失超1500亿美元，现有预测性维护模型忽略电网故障的空间、时间和因果依赖，亟需改进。

Method: 采用多层图神经网络（GNN）框架，融合图注意力网络（空间）、图卷积网络（时间）和图同构网络（因果），并结合注意力加权嵌入。

Result: 模型30天F1分数达0.8935±0.0258，优于XGBoost和随机森林；HDBSCAN聚类识别8个风险组，高风险组每年388.4次故障，恢复时间602.6分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进故障预测和风险聚类，支持电网主动管理。

Abstract: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually,
partly due to predictive maintenance (PdM) models that overlook spatial,
temporal, and causal dependencies in grid failures. This study introduces a
multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable
resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from
Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework
integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks
(temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through
attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935
+/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and
single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops
performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering
on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The
highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and
602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62
incidents/year. ANOVA (p < 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster
separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a
Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527. This work supports
proactive grid management through improved failure prediction and risk-aware
substation clustering.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task
decomposition and end-to-end approaches, applicable to both static and dynamic
flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法在完全自主的GNSS拒止导航系统中有效，能够准确识别和定位目标船只。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了跨类别动物运动的转移，并有效保留了其习惯性行为，为动画和虚拟现实应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench揭示了当前MLLMs在空间可视化任务中的不足，填补了领域空白，并公开发布了该基准。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

Result: TreeBench包含405个挑战性问题，先进模型准确率低于60%；TreeVGR显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 可追踪性是提升视觉接地推理的关键。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming

Key words: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation, objectness-aware, anomaly scoring, boundary refinement, autonomous driving

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Objectomaly的物体感知优化框架，用于解决现有掩码方法在OoD分割中的边界不精确、异常分数不一致和背景噪声问题，通过三阶段优化实现高性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有的基于掩码的OoD分割方法在边界精度、异常分数一致性和背景噪声上表现不佳，而安全敏感的自动驾驶应用需要更精确的解决方案。

Method: Objectomaly框架包含三阶段：1) 粗糙异常评分(CAS)，2) 基于SAM实例掩码的物体感知分数校准(OASC)，3) 使用拉普拉斯滤波和高斯平滑的边界精细处理(MBP)。

Result: 在多个OoD分割基准测试中（如SMIYC和RoadAnomaly）取得最优性能，像素级和组件级指标均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过引入物体级先验和边界优化，显著提升了OoD分割的精确性和鲁棒性，适用于自动驾驶等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在链式思维（CoT）推理中常常忽略生成的理由内容，影响了其接地性和准确性。

Method: 重新表述多模态CoT推理为KL约束的奖励最大化问题，提出RED解码策略，通过联合图像和理由条件化的下一个令牌分布来优化推理。

Result: RED在多个基准测试和LVLMs中显著优于标准CoT和其他解码方法，提升了推理的准确性和可信度。

Conclusion: RED是一种实用且有效的方法，为构建更可靠的理由接地多模态系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Method: 方法包括比较多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑），并测试了八种不同分类任务在多种自然偏移下的表现。

Result: 研究发现：（1）同时应用熵正则化和标签平滑能提供最好的校准效果；（2）暴露于少量语义分布外数据的后处理校准器在偏移下最稳健；（3）针对偏移设计的校准方法并未显著优于简单后处理方法；（4）提高偏移校准可能损害分布内校准。

Conclusion: 结论显示，预训练模型的校准效果优于从头训练的模型，而集成与预训练结合能提供最佳校准结果。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

Result: 实验表明，Recall在对抗效果、计算效率和语义保真度上优于现有基线，揭示了当前去学习机制的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发更鲁棒的解决方案以确保生成模型安全性和可靠性的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优方法（VPT）使用数据集级提示，在处理下游任务时表现不佳，原因是数据集的方差较大。

Method: 提出Visual Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT)，为每个输入生成实例感知提示，并通过主成分分析（PCA）保留关键提示信息。

Result: 在34个多样化数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT性能优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: ViaPT通过平衡数据集级和实例级知识，为视觉变换器提供了一种新的提示分析和优化范式。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Result: 在EEGCVPR数据集上实现了最先进的视觉解码，展示了语义与神经认知通路的对齐。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的语义中介，实现了从EEG信号中解码与认知对齐的视觉体验。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing是一种简单有效的方法，能够增强视频扩散模型的几何感知能力，从而生成更具3D一致性的视频。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Motivation: 现有视频大型语言模型因时空令牌数量过多导致计算复杂度高，通过发现和利用视频数据的局部冗余性来解决这一问题。

Method: STTM采用从粗到细的搜索策略，将每帧转换为多粒度空间令牌，并在时间维度上进行定向成对合并。

Result: 在六个视频问答基准测试中表现优异，50%令牌预算下速度提升2倍且精度仅下降0.5%，30%预算下速度提升3倍且精度下降2%。

Conclusion: STTM无需训练，高效且适用于不同查询，支持同一视频的KV缓存复用。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Motivation: 现有脑视觉解码评估协议依赖粗糙指标，无法捕捉模型间的细微差异，缺乏神经科学基础，无法识别细粒度的视觉区别。

Method: BASIC采用分层分割指标（如前景、语义、实例和组件掩码）评估结构保真度；利用多模态大语言模型提取场景表示（如对象、属性和关系）评估语义对齐。

Conclusion: BASIC为脑视觉解码方法提供了更精细、可解释且全面的评估基础。

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Conclusion: DMPO为扩散模型对齐提供了一种稳健且优雅的途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource-constrained wearable devices
demands inference models that harmonize accuracy with computational efficiency.
This paper introduces TinierHAR, an ultra-lightweight deep learning
architecture that synergizes residual depthwise separable convolutions, gated
recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal aggregation to achieve SOTA efficiency
without compromising performance. Evaluated across 14 public HAR datasets,
TinierHAR reduces Parameters by 2.7x (vs. TinyHAR) and 43.3x (vs.
DeepConvLSTM), and MACs by 6.4x and 58.6x, respectively, while maintaining the
averaged F1-scores. Beyond quantitative gains, this work provides the first
systematic ablation study dissecting the contributions of spatial-temporal
components across proposed TinierHAR, prior SOTA TinyHAR, and the classical
DeepConvLSTM, offering actionable insights for designing efficient HAR systems.
We finally discussed the findings and suggested principled design guidelines
for future efficient HAR. To catalyze edge-HAR research, we open-source all
materials in this work for future
benchmarking\footnote{https://github.com/zhaxidele/TinierHAR}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 探讨训练数据中概念组合对CLIP和大型多模态模型（LMMs）组合泛化能力的影响。

Method: 使用点互信息（PMI）测量词共现频率，生成合成图像验证PMI与模型准确性的相关性。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确性高度相关（r=0.97），且在自然图像中同样显著（r=0.75），且此现象延伸至LMMs。

Conclusion: 需开发无需组合扩展训练数据的算法和架构以提高多模态模型的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Result: 指出去中心化AI的潜在风险（如能力扩散、可检测性降低）和可能的益处（如隐私保护和权力分散）。

Conclusion: 呼吁更精确的政策制定以应对计算资源管理、能力扩散和去中心化AI发展的挑战。

Abstract: Advances in low-communication training algorithms are enabling a shift from
centralised model training to compute setups that are either distributed across
multiple clusters or decentralised via community-driven contributions. This
paper distinguishes these two scenarios - distributed and decentralised
training - which are little understood and often conflated in policy discourse.
We discuss how they could impact technical AI governance through an increased
risk of compute structuring, capability proliferation, and the erosion of
detectability and shutdownability. While these trends foreshadow a possible new
paradigm that could challenge key assumptions of compute governance, we
emphasise that certain policy levers, like export controls, remain relevant. We
also acknowledge potential benefits of decentralised AI, including
privacy-preserving training runs that could unlock access to more data, and
mitigating harmful power concentration. Our goal is to support more precise
policymaking around compute, capability proliferation, and decentralised AI
development.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a
steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model,
artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective
optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A
one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer
resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high
computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was
constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while
maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into
three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2)
maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a
combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further
ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference
by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on
the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID). Optimal results include a
methane conversion of 0.863 with 4.556 mol/s hydrogen output in the first case,
and 0.988 methane conversion with 3.335 mol/s hydrogen and 0.781 mol/s carbon
dioxide in the third. This comprehensive methodology offers a scalable and
effective strategy for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with
multiple, often conflicting, objectives.
