This challenge arises primarily\nfrom two aspects: firstly, the capabilities of existing models in text\ngeneration are limited; secondly, embedding algorithms fail to effectively\nmitigate the negative impacts of sensitive information's properties, such as\nsemantic content or randomness. Specifically, to ensure that the recipient can\naccurately extract hidden information, embedding algorithms often have to\nconsider selecting candidate words with relatively low probabilities. This\nphenomenon leads to a decrease in the number of high-probability candidate\nwords and an increase in low-probability candidate words, thereby compromising\nthe semantic coherence and logical fluency of the steganographic text and\ndiminishing the overall quality of the generated steganographic material. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel embedding algorithm,\ncharacter-based diffusion embedding algorithm (CDEA). Unlike existing embedding\nalgorithms that strive to eliminate the impact of sensitive information's\nproperties on the generation process, CDEA leverages sensitive information's\nproperties. It enhances the selection frequency of high-probability candidate\nwords in the candidate pool based on general statistical properties at the\ncharacter level and grouping methods based on power-law distributions, while\nreducing the selection frequency of low-probability candidate words in the\ncandidate pool. Furthermore, to ensure the effective transformation of\nsensitive information in long sequences, we also introduce the XLNet model.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the combination of CDEA and XLNet\nsignificantly improves the quality of generated steganographic text,\nparticularly in terms of perceptual-imperceptibility."}

The\nmodel incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its\nfeature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status\nrecognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns\ngeneralized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective;\nin the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary\nclassification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of\n10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate\nthat SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning,\nensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy\n(97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the\neffectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex\nanomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance\nsolutions for shared mobility."}

A new field called Embodied Artificial Intelligence,\nwhich places at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics, and Decision\nMaking, has been gaining importance during the last few years, as it aims to\nfoster the development of smart autonomous robots and their deployment in\nsociety. The recent availability of large collections of 3D models for\nphotorealistic robotic simulation has allowed faster and safe training of\nlearning-based agents for millions of frames and a careful evaluation of their\nbehavior before deploying the models on real robotic platforms.

Advances in Deep Learning (DL) have\naddressed these issues by learning highly nonlinear input-output dependencies.\nHowever, model interpretability and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) have often\nstraggled behind. In this context, we introduce the Competitive/Collaborative\nFusion of Experts (CoCoAFusE), a novel, Bayesian Covariates-Dependent Modeling\ntechnique. CoCoAFusE builds on the very philosophy behind Mixtures of Experts\n(MoEs), blending predictions from several simple sub-models (or \"experts\") to\nachieve high levels of expressiveness while retaining a substantial degree of\nlocal interpretability. Our formulation extends that of a classical Mixture of\nExperts by contemplating the fusion of the experts' distributions in addition\nto their more usual mixing (i.e., superimposition). Through this additional\nfeature, CoCoAFusE better accommodates different scenarios for the intermediate\nbehavior between generating mechanisms, resulting in tighter credible bounds on\nthe response variable. Indeed, only resorting to mixing, as in classical MoEs,\nmay lead to multimodality artifacts, especially over smooth transitions.\nInstead, CoCoAFusE can avoid these artifacts even under the same structure and\npriors for the experts, leading to greater expressiveness and flexibility in\nmodeling.

However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations\nthat are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios\noften diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to\ngenerate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value\nPortrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value\norientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of\nitems that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of\nassessment results to real-world LLM usage and thus ecological validity.\nSecond, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their\nown thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual\nvalue scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that\nitems strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for\nassessing those values. Through evaluating 27 LLMs with our benchmark, we find\nthat these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values\nwhile placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values.

TinyML facilitates the on-device execution of the inference phase\nof ML algorithms on embedded and wearable devices, and more recently, it has\nexpanded into On-device Learning (ODL), which allows both inference and\nlearning phases to occur directly on the device. The application of ODL\ntechniques to wearable devices is particularly compelling, as it enables the\ndevelopment of more personalized models that adapt based on the data of the\nuser. However, one of the major challenges of ODL algorithms is the scarcity of\nlabeled data collected on-device.

Addressing this, we present a systematic\nempirical study evaluating the impact of fine-tuning depth. We adapt a standard\nYOLOv8n model to a custom, fine-grained fruit detection dataset by\nprogressively unfreezing backbone layers (freeze points at layers 22, 15, and\n10) and training. Performance was rigorously evaluated on both the target fruit\ndataset and, using a dual-head evaluation architecture, on the original COCO\nvalidation set. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that deeper fine-tuning\n(unfreezing down to layer 10) yields substantial performance gains (e.g., +10\\%\nabsolute mAP50) on the fine-grained fruit task compared to only training the\nhead.

The augmented dataset is\nthen used to train a classical machine learning-based obsolescence forecasting\nmodel. To train classical forecasting models using augmented datasets, existing\nclassical supervised-learning classifiers are adapted for semi-supervised\nlearning within this framework. The proposed framework demonstrates\nstate-of-the-art results on benchmarking datasets."}

However, HFL remains vulnerable to\nadversarial and unreliable vehicles, whose misleading updates can significantly\ncompromise the integrity and convergence of the global model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel defense framework that integrates dynamic\nvehicle selection with robust anomaly detection within a cluster-based HFL\narchitecture, specifically designed to counter Gaussian noise and gradient\nascent attacks. The framework performs a comprehensive reliability assessment\nfor each vehicle by evaluating historical accuracy, contribution frequency, and\nanomaly records. Anomaly detection combines Z-score and cosine similarity\nanalyses on model updates to identify both statistical outliers and directional\ndeviations in model updates. To further refine detection, an adaptive\nthresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric,\ndynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each\nvehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing\nvehicles. In addition, a weighted gradient averaging mechanism is implemented,\nwhich assigns higher weights to gradient updates from more trustworthy\nvehicles. To defend against coordinated attacks, a cross-cluster consistency\ncheck is applied to identify collaborative attacks in which multiple\ncompromised clusters coordinate misleading updates. Together, these mechanisms\nform a multi-level defense strategy to filter out malicious contributions\neffectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly\nreduces convergence time compared to benchmark methods across both 1-hop and\n3-hop topologies."}

We refer\nto this task as Vocabulary-Free FGVR (VF-FGVR), where a model must predict\nlabels from an unconstrained output space without prior label information.\nWhile recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show potential for\nVF-FGVR, querying these models for each test input is impractical because of\nhigh costs and prohibitive inference times. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Nea}rest-Neighbor Label \\textbf{R}efinement (NeaR), a novel\napproach that fine-tunes a downstream CLIP model using labels generated by an\nMLLM. Our approach constructs a weakly supervised dataset from a small,\nunlabeled training set, leveraging MLLMs for label generation. NeaR is designed\nto handle the noise, stochasticity, and open-endedness inherent in labels\ngenerated by MLLMs, and establishes a new benchmark for efficient VF-FGVR."}

To further refine detection, an adaptive\nthresholding mechanism is incorporated into the cosine similarity metric,\ndynamically adjusting the threshold based on the historical accuracy of each\nvehicle to enforce stricter standards for consistently high-performing\nvehicles.

GCP, built upon an instance segmentation framework,\nprocesses binary masks produced by any instance segmentation model. The\nalgorithm begins by collecting polylines sampled along the contours of the\nbinary masks. These polylines undergo a refinement process using a\ntransformer-based regression module to ensure they accurately fit the contours\nof the targeted building instances. Subsequently, a collinearity-aware polygon\nsimplification module simplifies these refined polylines and generate the final\npolygon representation. This module employs dynamic programming technique to\noptimize an objective function that balances the simplicity and fidelity of the\npolygons, achieving globally optimal solutions. Furthermore, the optimized\ncollinearity-aware objective is seamlessly integrated into network training,\nenhancing the cohesiveness of the entire pipeline. The effectiveness of GCP has\nbeen validated on two public benchmarks for polygonal building mapping. Further\nexperiments reveal that applying the collinearity-aware polygon simplification\nmodule to arbitrary polylines, without prior knowledge, enhances accuracy over\ntraditional methods such as the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This finding\nunderscores the broad applicability of GCP. The code for the proposed method\nwill be made available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab."}

This is similar to how humans improve their\nskills through continuous practice. However, achieving effective\nself-improvement is challenging, primarily because robots tend to repeat their\nexisting abilities during interactions, often failing to generate new, valuable\ndata for learning. In this paper, we identify the key to successful\nself-improvement: modal-level exploration and data selection. By incorporating\na modal-level exploration mechanism during policy execution, the robot can\nproduce more diverse and multi-modal interactions. At the same time, we select\nthe most valuable trials and high-quality segments from these interactions for\nlearning. We successfully demonstrate effective robot self-improvement on both\nsimulation benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Existing watermarking approaches,\nwhether passive, post-hoc, or adapted from image-based techniques, often\nstruggle to withstand video-specific manipulations such as frame insertion,\ndropping, or reordering, and typically degrade visual quality. In this work, we\nintroduce VIDSTAMP, a watermarking framework that embeds per-frame or\nper-segment messages directly into the latent space of temporally-aware video\ndiffusion models. By fine-tuning the model's decoder through a two-stage\npipeline, first on static image datasets to promote spatial message separation,\nand then on synthesized video sequences to restore temporal consistency,\nVIDSTAMP learns to embed high-capacity, flexible watermarks with minimal\nperceptual impact. Leveraging architectural components such as 3D convolutions\nand temporal attention, our method imposes no additional inference cost and\noffers better perceptual quality than prior methods, while maintaining\ncomparable robustness against common distortions and tampering. VIDSTAMP embeds\n768 bits per video (48 bits per frame) with a bit accuracy of 95.0%, achieves a\nlog P-value of -166.65 (lower is better), and maintains a video quality score\nof 0.836, comparable to unwatermarked outputs (0.838) and surpassing prior\nmethods in capacity-quality tradeoffs.

Altschuler"], "title": "Negative Stepsizes Make Gradient-Descent-Ascent Converge", "categories": ["math.OC", "cs.DS", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Efficient computation of min-max problems is a central question in\noptimization, learning, games, and controls. Arguably the most natural\nalgorithm is gradient-descent-ascent (GDA). However, since the 1970s,\nconventional wisdom has argued that GDA fails to converge even on simple\nproblems. This failure spurred an extensive literature on modifying GDA with\nadditional building blocks such as extragradients, optimism, momentum,\nanchoring, etc. In contrast, we show that GDA converges in its original form by\nsimply using a judicious choice of stepsizes.\n  The key innovation is the proposal of unconventional stepsize schedules\n(dubbed slingshot stepsize schedules) that are time-varying, asymmetric, and\nperiodically negative. We show that all three properties are necessary for\nconvergence, and that altogether this enables GDA to converge on the classical\ncounterexamples (e.g., unconstrained convex-concave problems). All of our\nresults apply to the last iterate of GDA, as is typically desired in practice.\n  The core algorithmic intuition is that although negative stepsizes make\nbackward progress, they de-synchronize the min and max variables (overcoming\nthe cycling issue of GDA), and lead to a slingshot phenomenon in which the\nforward progress in the other iterations is overwhelmingly larger. This results\nin fast overall convergence. Geometrically, the slingshot dynamics leverage the\nnon-reversibility of gradient flow: positive/negative steps cancel to first\norder, yielding a second-order net movement in a new direction that leads to\nconvergence and is otherwise impossible for GDA to move in. We interpret this\nas a second-order finite-differencing algorithm and show that, intriguingly, it\napproximately implements consensus optimization, an empirically popular\nalgorithm for min-max problems involving deep neural networks (e.g., training\nGANs)."}

Motion generation\nmodels focus on creating diverse, realistic motions from inputs like text,\naudio, or keyframes, while motion estimation models aim to reconstruct accurate\nmotion trajectories from observations like videos. Despite sharing underlying\nrepresentations of temporal dynamics and kinematics, this separation limits\nknowledge transfer between tasks and requires maintaining separate models. We\npresent GENMO, a unified Generalist Model for Human Motion that bridges motion\nestimation and generation in a single framework. Our key insight is to\nreformulate motion estimation as constrained motion generation, where the\noutput motion must precisely satisfy observed conditioning signals. Leveraging\nthe synergy between regression and diffusion, GENMO achieves accurate global\nmotion estimation while enabling diverse motion generation. We also introduce\nan estimation-guided training objective that exploits in-the-wild videos with\n2D annotations and text descriptions to enhance generative diversity.\nFurthermore, our novel architecture handles variable-length motions and mixed\nmultimodal conditions (text, audio, video) at different time intervals,\noffering flexible control. This unified approach creates synergistic benefits:\ngenerative priors improve estimated motions under challenging conditions like\nocclusions, while diverse video data enhances generation capabilities.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate GENMO's effectiveness as a generalist\nframework that successfully handles multiple human motion tasks within a single\nmodel."}
