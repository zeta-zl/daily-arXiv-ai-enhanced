### [1] [How Social is It? A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04628)
*Yusen Wu,Junwu Xiong,Xiaotie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HSII的基准测试，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂社交任务中的能力，并通过四个阶段全面测试其社交表现。同时研究了链式思维（COT）对性能的影响，并提出了COT-complexity指标以权衡正确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统地衡量LLMs在多用户、多轮社交任务中独立扮演角色的能力，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了基于社会学原理的代理任务分级框架和HSII基准测试，包含四个阶段：格式解析、目标选择、目标切换对话和稳定对话。通过HSII-Dataset进行实验，并研究COT方法的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，HSII基准能有效评估LLMs的社交能力，且COT方法虽提升性能但增加计算成本，COT-complexity指标能优化效率与正确性的权衡。

Conclusion: HSII是评估LLMs社交能力的合适工具，未来可扩展至更复杂的社会场景。

Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,
instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with
only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently
play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social
settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically
measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an
agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.
Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII
below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social
agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:
format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable
conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion
capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,
HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform
an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'
social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new
statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs
with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between
measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments
demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in
LLMs.

### [2] [Adaptive Token Boundaries: Integrating Human Chunking Mechanisms into Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04637)
*Dongxing Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与人类认知过程的差距，提出了一种动态跨模态标记化框架，显著提升了模型性能并更贴近人类认知模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态信息整合中存在与人类认知的显著差异，尤其是静态标记化方法限制了模型模拟人类动态、上下文敏感处理的能力。

Method: 提出了一种动态跨模态标记化框架，结合自适应边界、分层表示和基于认知科学原理的对齐机制，并通过视觉-语言任务的实证研究验证。

Result: 新框架在VQA和复杂场景描述任务上分别实现+7.8%和+5.3%的性能提升，且错误模式和注意力分布更接近人类。

Conclusion: 研究为人类认知与AI的理论关联提供了新见解，并为开发更符合认知的AI系统提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet
significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and
computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research
presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human
cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in
MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with
model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that
conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current
models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human
information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal
tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical
representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science
principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on
benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene
Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention
distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of
the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while
providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI
systems.

### [3] [Language translation, and change of accent for speech-to-speech task using diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04639)
*Abhishek Mishra,Ritesh Sur Chowdhury,Vartul Bahuguna,Isha Pandey,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种同时进行语音翻译和口音调整的统一方法，利用扩散模型生成目标语音的梅尔频谱图，优化翻译和口音适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音到语音翻译（S2ST）通常只关注语言翻译或口音调整，而跨文化沟通需要同时处理两者。

Method: 将问题重新定义为条件生成任务，利用扩散模型生成目标语音的梅尔频谱图，并通过源语音转录和目标语音特征进行指导。

Result: 提出的集成框架在翻译和口音适应方面更高效且有效，优于传统流程。

Conclusion: 该方法为同时处理语音翻译和口音调整提供了新的解决方案，具有更高的参数效率和效果。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one
language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language
translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural
communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating
content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language
context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech
translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current
literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation
task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target
speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for
high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion
strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel
spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and
accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of
translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and
effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估文化相关毒性内容（如隐晦侮辱、讽刺）的检测性能，填补通用系统在此领域的不足。

Method: 使用OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix数据集测试Typica.ai模型与OpenAI、Mistral、Anthropic Claude的API，对比精确率、召回率、F1值和准确率。

Result: Typica.ai表现最优，证明文化适配模型在内容审核中的优势。

Conclusion: 文化适应性模型对可靠的内容审核至关重要，尤其在 underrepresented语言中。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative benchmark evaluating the performance of
Typica.ai's custom Moroccan Darija toxicity detection model against major
LLM-based moderation APIs: OpenAI (omni-moderation-latest), Mistral
(mistral-moderation-latest), and Anthropic Claude (claude-3-haiku-20240307). We
focus on culturally grounded toxic content, including implicit insults,
sarcasm, and culturally specific aggression often overlooked by general-purpose
systems. Using a balanced test set derived from the OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix dataset,
we report precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, offering insights into
challenges and opportunities for moderation in underrepresented languages. Our
results highlight Typica.ai's superior performance, underlining the importance
of culturally adapted models for reliable content moderation.

### [5] [Rethinking Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: A High-Accuracy, Simplified Fusion Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04642)
*Nischal Mandal,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级的融合深度学习模型，用于多模态情感分析，通过简单串联和密集融合层实现高效情感分类，准确率达92%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用复杂的注意力机制和分层架构，但计算开销大。本文旨在设计一种轻量且高效的模型，适用于资源受限环境。

Method: 使用模态特定的编码器（全连接层和Dropout）处理文本、音频和视觉特征，通过简单串联和密集融合层实现多模态信息融合。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，模型在六类情感分类中达到92%的准确率，证明了简单融合策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计特征和模块化结构，简单融合方法可媲美或超越复杂模型，尤其适合资源受限场景。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks
to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and
visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention
mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet
effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion
classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned
text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a
modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout
regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using
simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture
cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational
overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful
feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can
outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained
environments.

### [6] [Prediction-powered estimators for finite population statistics in highly imbalanced textual data: Public hate crime estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04643)
*Hannes Waldetoft,Jakob Torgander,Måns Magnusson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用Transformer编码器神经网络预测与经典调查抽样方法结合，有效估计文本数据中的目标变量，应用于瑞典仇恨犯罪统计，显著减少手动标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限文本数据集中获取目标变量标签需手动标注的挑战，提高估计效率。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器预测与Hansen-Hurwitz估计、差异估计及分层随机抽样估计方法。

Result: 在瑞典仇恨犯罪统计中验证了方法的实用性，实现了高效的参数估计。

Conclusion: 若具备标注训练数据，该方法能提供高效估计并大幅降低手动标注成本。

Abstract: Estimating population parameters in finite populations of text documents can
be challenging when obtaining the labels for the target variable requires
manual annotation. To address this problem, we combine predictions from a
transformer encoder neural network with well-established survey sampling
estimators using the model predictions as an auxiliary variable. The
applicability is demonstrated in Swedish hate crime statistics based on Swedish
police reports. Estimates of the yearly number of hate crimes and the police's
under-reporting are derived using the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator, difference
estimation, and stratified random sampling estimation. We conclude that if
labeled training data is available, the proposed method can provide very
efficient estimates with reduced time spent on manual annotation.

### [7] [ChatGPT for automated grading of short answer questions in mechanical ventilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04645)
*Tejas Jade,Alex Yartsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了ChatGPT 4o在研究生医学教育中自动评分短答案问题的效果，发现其评分与人类评分者差异显著，一致性低，尤其在高阶认知题目上表现更差，建议在高风险评估中谨慎使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理自由文本时表现出与人工评分相似的能力，因此被探索用于自动评分，但此前对其在研究生教育中的实际效果缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 使用ChatGPT 4o对215名学生的557份短答案进行评分，对比人类评分，并通过混合效应模型、方差分析、ICC、Cohen's kappa等统计方法分析一致性和偏差。

Result: ChatGPT评分显著低于人类（平均偏差-1.34），个体一致性差（ICC1=0.086），高阶题目分歧更大，60%以上评分超出可接受误差范围。

Conclusion: LLMs在研究生课程评分中表现不可靠，尤其在高风险评估中需谨慎使用，建议优先选择明确规则的题目类型以减少分歧。

Abstract: Standardised tests using short answer questions (SAQs) are common in
postgraduate education. Large language models (LLMs) simulate conversational
language and interpret unstructured free-text responses in ways aligning with
applying SAQ grading rubrics, making them attractive for automated grading. We
evaluated ChatGPT 4o to grade SAQs in a postgraduate medical setting using data
from 215 students (557 short-answer responses) enrolled in an online course on
mechanical ventilation (2020--2024). Deidentified responses to three case-based
scenarios were presented to ChatGPT with a standardised grading prompt and
rubric. Outputs were analysed using mixed-effects modelling, variance component
analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cohen's kappa, Kendall's
W, and Bland--Altman statistics. ChatGPT awarded systematically lower marks
than human graders with a mean difference (bias) of -1.34 on a 10-point scale.
ICC values indicated poor individual-level agreement (ICC1 = 0.086), and
Cohen's kappa (-0.0786) suggested no meaningful agreement. Variance component
analysis showed minimal variability among the five ChatGPT sessions (G-value =
0.87), indicating internal consistency but divergence from the human grader.
The poorest agreement was observed for evaluative and analytic items, whereas
checklist and prescriptive rubric items had less disagreement. We caution
against the use of LLMs in grading postgraduate coursework. Over 60% of
ChatGPT-assigned grades differed from human grades by more than acceptable
boundaries for high-stakes assessments.

Conclusion: FRAME为自动化医学论文生成提供了坚实基础，同时保持学术严谨性。

Abstract: The automation of scientific research through large language models (LLMs)
presents significant opportunities but faces critical challenges in knowledge
synthesis and quality assurance. We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent
Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation
through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises
three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that
decomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through
iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator,
Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality
through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework
that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements
over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with
DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation
dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve
quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in
synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work
could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for
automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic
standards.

Method: 文章分析了符号框架、生成模型、混合系统、多智能体架构等技术，包括检索增强生成、知识图谱补全、因果推断等，并对比了传统符号系统与现代LLM流程。

Result: 综述覆盖了生物医学、材料科学等领域的多类数据集，并提出了新颖性生成、多模态-符号集成等未来研究方向。

Conclusion: LLMs有望成为科学发现的规模化工具，但需结合人类参与与伦理保障，推动更具原则性的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific hypothesis
generation and validation by enabling information synthesis, latent
relationship discovery, and reasoning augmentation. This survey provides a
structured overview of LLM-driven approaches, including symbolic frameworks,
generative models, hybrid systems, and multi-agent architectures. We examine
techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge-graph completion,
simulation, causal inference, and tool-assisted reasoning, highlighting
trade-offs in interpretability, novelty, and domain alignment. We contrast
early symbolic discovery systems (e.g., BACON, KEKADA) with modern LLM
pipelines that leverage in-context learning and domain adaptation via
fine-tuning, retrieval, and symbolic grounding. For validation, we review
simulation, human-AI collaboration, causal modeling, and uncertainty
quantification, emphasizing iterative assessment in open-world contexts. The
survey maps datasets across biomedicine, materials science, environmental
science, and social science, introducing new resources like AHTech and
CSKG-600. Finally, we outline a roadmap emphasizing novelty-aware generation,
multimodal-symbolic integration, human-in-the-loop systems, and ethical
safeguards, positioning LLMs as agents for principled, scalable scientific
discovery.

TL;DR: 研究评估了Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE)在远程医疗中的多模态诊断推理能力，结果显示其在多数临床指标上优于初级保健医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）的诊断对话评估多局限于纯文本交互，而实际远程医疗需处理多模态医疗数据，因此研究旨在提升AI在多模态环境下的诊断能力。

Method: 通过Gemini 2.0 Flash实现状态感知对话框架，动态控制问诊流程，并利用患者状态不确定性指导后续问题。在OSCE式研究中，与初级保健医师对比评估105个多模态场景。

Result: AMIE在7/9多模态指标和29/32非多模态指标（包括诊断准确性）上优于初级保健医师。

Conclusion: 研究表明多模态对话诊断AI取得进展，但实际应用仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting
diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to
language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of
remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and
patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in
medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while
preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains
unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management
performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a
new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this
precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system
implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is
dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states
and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by
uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal
history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE
to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of
chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation
scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of
clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric
assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like
history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and
empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9
multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The
results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but
real-world translation needs further research.

Method: 使用新指标RDC（Relative Danger Coefficient）评估包括DeepSeek-V3、GPT变体和Gemini在内的多款AI模型。

Result: 比较分析了不同模型的伦理表现，发现需要强化人类监督，尤其是在高风险场景。

Conclusion: AI伦理问题亟待解决，RDC可作为评估工具，同时人类在高风险情况下的监督至关重要。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly
evolved in recent years, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding and generation. However, these advancements also raise critical
ethical questions regarding safety, potential misuse, discrimination and
overall societal impact. This article provides a comparative analysis of the
ethical performance of various AI models, including the brand new
DeepSeek-V3(R1 with reasoning and without), various GPT variants (4o, 3.5
Turbo, 4 Turbo, o1/o3 mini) and Gemini (1.5 flash, 2.0 flash and 2.0 flash exp)
and highlights the need for robust human oversight, especially in situations
with high stakes. Furthermore, we present a new metric for calculating harm in
LLMs called Relative Danger Coefficient (RDC).

TL;DR: 论文通过结合深度学习和大型语言模型（LLM）自动从临床文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），提升了分类性能并显著减少了处理时间，同时展示了合成数据对模型性能的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康状况有显著影响，但其自动提取在临床文本中的效率与精度仍有提升空间。论文旨在比较传统深度学习和LLMs的优势与不足，并提出高效解决方案。

Method: 结合传统深度学习和LLMs，提出一种高效分类方法，消除昂贵的LLM处理步骤，并在合成数据增强的数据集上测试多个模型。

Result: 模型在多标签SDoH分类上比基准提升了10分，且执行速度提升了12倍，同时在合成数据上展示了高性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在精度和效率上均优于传统方法，为高风险患者的SDoH自动预测提供了新一代解决方案。

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) are economic, social and personal
circumstances that affect or influence an individual's health status. SDoHs
have shown to be correlated to wellness outcomes, and therefore, are useful to
physicians in diagnosing diseases and in decision-making. In this work, we
automatically extract SDoHs from clinical text using traditional deep learning
and Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the advantages and disadvantages of
each on an existing publicly available dataset. Our models outperform a
previous reference point on a multilabel SDoH classification by 10 points, and
we present a method and model to drastically speed up classification (12X
execution time) by eliminating expensive LLM processing. The method we present
combines a more nimble and efficient solution that leverages the power of the
LLM for precision and traditional deep learning methods for efficiency. We also
show highly performant results on a dataset supplemented with synthetic data
and several traditional deep learning models that outperform LLMs. Our models
and methods offer the next iteration of automatic prediction of SDoHs that
impact at-risk patients.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLMs）生成合成跌倒数据以解决真实跌倒数据稀缺的问题，分析了多种文本到运动（T2M）和文本到文本模型的效果，并评估了合成数据对跌倒检测性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实中老年人跌倒数据稀缺，训练跌倒检测系统具有挑战性。研究旨在通过合成数据填补这一空白，提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用多种文本到运动（T2M, SATO, ParCo）和文本到文本模型（GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini）生成合成跌倒数据，并与四个真实数据集结合，采用LSTM模型评估性能。还比较了LLM生成数据与基于扩散方法的数据对齐效果。

Result: 合成数据的效果受数据集特性影响显著：LLM生成数据在低频（如20Hz）表现最佳，但在高频（如200Hz）不稳定；文本到运动模型能生成更真实的生物力学数据，但对检测效果的影响不一；扩散模型数据最接近真实分布，但未一致提升性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据的效果依赖于传感器位置和跌倒表现方式。研究为优化跌倒检测模型的合成数据生成提供了实用洞见。

Abstract: Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of
real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this,
we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and
text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall
scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four
real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection
performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we
compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate
their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that
dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic
data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g.,
20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While
text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than
text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based
synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not
consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that
the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall
representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data
generation for fall detection models.

Abstract: Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for
personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in
actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with
measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area
worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized
risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital
advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model
(LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer
architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural
language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an
algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor
risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing,
feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT
for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user
portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure
the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper
designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a
large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The
experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively
improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the
same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the
risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出使用检索增强生成（RAG）构建一个基于建筑规范的问答系统，重点优化检索器和语言模型的生成能力，实验证明Elasticsearch是高效检索器，且语言模型经领域微调后表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑规范内容繁杂且更新频繁，手工查询效率低下，需通过自动化技术（如QA系统）提升查询效率和准确性。

Method: 采用RAG框架（检索器+语言模型），对比多种检索方法（以加拿大国家建筑规范NBCC为数据集），并对语言模型进行领域微调。

Result: Elasticsearch为最佳检索器；语言模型经NBCC数据集微调后生成能力显著提升，结合高效检索器可优化系统性能。

Conclusion: 基于RAG的QA系统能有效应对建筑规范复杂性，检索器选择和语言模型微调是关键优化方向。

Abstract: Building codes are regulations that establish standards for the design,
construction, and safety of buildings to ensure structural integrity, fire
protection, and accessibility. They are often extensive, complex, and subject
to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming. Key
difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical
language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections. A
potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers
user queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a
QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG
consists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study
focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and
optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning
techniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by
performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and
explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models
using the dataset derived from NBCC. Our analysis included a comparative
assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and
fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of
language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset. Experimental results
showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The
findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific
dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses.
When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like
Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system,
enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.

### [16] [Reward-SQL: Boosting Text-to-SQL via Stepwise Reasoning and Process-Supervised Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04671)
*Yuxin Zhang,Meihao Fan,Ju Fan,Mingyang Yi,Yuyu Luo,Jian Tan,Guoliang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reward-SQL框架通过结合Process Reward Models（PRMs）提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能，采用‘冷启动后PRM监督’策略，显著提升模型准确性。在BIRD基准测试中，7B PRM监督的模型性能提升了13.1%，最终模型在开发集上达到68.9%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在Text-to-SQL任务中表现优异，但PRMs的误用可能会导致推理轨迹扭曲，进而生成次优或错误的SQL。为了有效利用PRMs提升推理准确性，提出了Reward-SQL框架。

Method: Reward-SQL采用‘冷启动后PRM监督’策略，首先利用Chain-of-CTEs分解SQL查询为结构化逐步推理链以建立基线，随后探索四种PRM整合策略，最终发现GRPO与PRM引导推断（如best-of-N采样）组合效果最佳。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，Reward-SQL使7B PRM监督的模型性能提升了13.1%，采用GRPO策略的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct模型在开发集上准确率达到68.9%，优于同规模基线方法。

Conclusion: Reward-SQL证明了奖励监督在Text-to-SQL推理中的有效性，提供了一种系统且高效的方法来整合PRMs，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning
capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external
Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to
provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the
reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To
address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically
explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process
effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision"
paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into
structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions
(Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline.
Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that
combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference
(e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD
benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1%
performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned
policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the
BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model
size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging
reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly
available.

*Madhur Jindal,Saurabh Deshpande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了REVEAL框架，用于评估视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）的安全性和伦理挑战，发现多轮交互的缺陷率显著高于单轮交互，GPT-4o和Pixtral表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视觉大语言模型的复杂性增加，传统评估框架无法应对多模态和多轮对话的安全挑战，因此需要一种新的评估方法。

Method: 提出REVEAL框架，包含自动化图像挖掘、合成对抗数据生成、多轮对话扩展（使用crescendo攻击策略）以及通过GPT-4o等评估器进行综合危害评估。

Result: 评估了五种VLLMs，发现多轮交互缺陷率显著更高；GPT-4o在安全-可用性指数（SUI）中表现最佳，虚假信息是主要问题领域。

Conclusion: REVEAL框架能有效评估VLLMs的安全性和伦理风险，多轮交互暴露了模型的深层脆弱性，需加强上下文防御。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with
textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding
application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel
safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn
conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for
text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these
complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible
Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated
pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated
image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational
expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment
through evaluators like GPT-4o.
  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2,
Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual
harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn
interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to
single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably,
GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our
Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally,
misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual
defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while
Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

Abstract: This paper presents a thoroughly automated method for identifying and
interpreting cuneiform characters via advanced deep-learning algorithms. Five
distinct deep-learning models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of
cuneiform characters and evaluated according to critical performance metrics,
including accuracy and precision. Two models demonstrated outstanding
performance and were subsequently assessed using cuneiform symbols from the
Hammurabi law acquisition, notably Hammurabi Law 1. Each model effectively
recognized the relevant Akkadian meanings of the symbols and delivered precise
English translations. Future work will investigate ensemble and stacking
approaches to optimize performance, utilizing hybrid architectures to improve
detection accuracy and reliability. This research explores the linguistic
relationships between Akkadian, an ancient Mesopotamian language, and Arabic,
emphasizing their historical and cultural linkages. This study demonstrates the
capability of deep learning to decipher ancient scripts by merging
computational linguistics with archaeology, therefore providing significant
insights for the comprehension and conservation of human history.

*Jingyang Deng,Ran Chen,Jo-Ku Cheng,Jinwen Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了SOAEsV2-7B/72B系列模型，通过三阶段框架解决中文国有资产业务领域大语言模型的三大挑战：模型容量受限、过度依赖领域监督数据以及推理效率低。实验结果显示模型在保持通用语言能力的同时显著提升领域表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前中文国有资产业务领域大语言模型在知识整合、跨任务适应性和推理效率方面的局限性。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：持续预训练整合领域知识，领域渐进式监督微调（SFT）优化任务表现，以及蒸馏增强的推测解码加速推理。

Result: 模型在保持99.8%通用语言能力的同时，领域任务表现显著提升（Rouge-1和BLEU-4分别提升1.08倍和1.17倍），且推理速度提升1.39-1.52倍。

Conclusion: 该研究为优化国有资产业务领域大语言模型提供了一种全面的全流程方法，平衡了通用语言能力与领域专业性。

Abstract: This study addresses key challenges in developing domain-specific large
language models (LLMs) for Chinese state-owned assets and enterprises (SOAEs),
where current approaches face three limitations: 1) constrained model capacity
that limits knowledge integration and cross-task adaptability; 2) excessive
reliance on domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which neglects
the broader applicability of general language patterns; and 3) inefficient
inference acceleration for large models processing long contexts. In this work,
we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase
framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while
retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based
learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to
expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3)
distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit
distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving
1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results
demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of
original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain
performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a
1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that
domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving
1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work
introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs,
bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific
expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补文学情感与视觉文化关联研究的空白，结合传统汉学方法与计算人文技术。

Method: 使用微调BERT模型分析唐宋诗词中的牡丹与梅花意象，并将其情感模式与同期物质文化（如纺织品、陶瓷）中的视觉证据进行交叉验证。

Result: 发现唐宋时期花卉意象的情感内涵存在可测量的变化，并揭示了文学表达与艺术表现之间未被认识到的协同关系。

Conclusion: 通过计算技术与传统方法的结合，本研究为唐宋文化表达的研究提供了新视角，证明了情感模式在文学与艺术中的同步演变。

Abstract: The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an
extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs
served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While
previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic
correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains
underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment
analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song
poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in
decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational
humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By
applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in
classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between
the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with
visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing
previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的幻觉检测方法依赖人工评估或闭源模型，成本高且推理速度慢，难以扩展应用。

Method: 通过构建一个扰动多跳QA数据集（包含诱导幻觉），并利用监督微调训练7B模型进行幻觉检测。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准上，7B模型的召回率优于GPT-4o，且在精度和准确率上表现竞争性，参数量更少。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且成本更低，为幻觉检测提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have gained widespread adoption
by application builders because they leverage sources of truth to enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate more factually sound responses. However,
hallucinations, instances of LLM responses that are unfaithful to the provided
context, often prevent these systems from being deployed in production
environments. Current hallucination detection methods typically involve human
evaluation or the use of closed-source models to review RAG system outputs for
hallucinations. Both human evaluators and closed-source models suffer from
scaling issues due to their high costs and slow inference speeds. In this work,
we introduce a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset with induced hallucinations. Via
supervised fine-tuning on our dataset, we achieve better recall with a 7B model
than GPT-4o on the RAGTruth hallucination detection benchmark and offer
competitive performance on precision and accuracy, all while using a fraction
of the parameters. Code is released at our repository.

Motivation: 尽管RAG尝试通过上下文减少LLM幻觉，但问题仍然存在。现有评估方法（如HHEM）存在局限，亟需更可靠的解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究通过FaithJudge提升了LLM幻觉评估的可靠性，并公开了新排行榜，推动相关研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce
hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided
context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or
contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations
with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce
hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM
hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model
(HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great
research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current
hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods
on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose
FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination
annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination
evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination
leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination
leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in
RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义检索系统难以适应学术内容的独特语言和结构特点，因此需要专门优化的嵌入模型以提升教育领域问答的准确性和效率。

Method: 构建了包含3,197句对的合成数据集，并评估了两种微调策略：基于MNRL的基线模型和结合MNRL与CosineSimilarityLoss的双重损失模型。

Result: 两种微调模型均优于现有开源基线（如all-MiniLM-L6-v2），双重损失模型进一步缩小了与高性能专有嵌入（如OpenAI的text-embedding-3系列）的差距。

Conclusion: 该研究为教育语义检索提供了可复用的嵌入模型和框架，支持学术聊天机器人、RAG系统和LMS集成等下游应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational
tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique
linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study
presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question
answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset
of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased
questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a
combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted
generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model
fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model
that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking
and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course
syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into
course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that
both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model
narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as
OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable,
domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for
educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as
academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning
management system (LMS) integrations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在揭示CoT在语言模型中的内在机制，特别是在解决复合任务时的作用。

Method: 通过数字乘法和动态规划任务，分析了CoT标记的作用，测试了不同形式的CoT影响。

Result: 发现CoT标记类似变量，仅保留中间结果标记即可维持性能，但可能引入缺陷。

Conclusion: CoT标记可能类似编程变量，但仍需关注其潜在问题。

Abstract: Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate
intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven
effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner
mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically
study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit
multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving
these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate
results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that
storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect
model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice
that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly.
These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer
programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and
computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available
at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.

Method: 研究使用英语语料库，分析解析树的互信息、偏离概率上下文无关文法（PCFG）的程度等统计特性，以及近似这些解析树的PCFG模型。

Result: 结果表明，关于幂律与层次结构关系的假设在句法结构中不成立，且难以推广到儿童语言和动物信号，需重新审视二者的关联。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有理论在解释幂律与语言层次结构关系时的局限性，强调需进一步探索其他可能的解释或模型。

Abstract: Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively
investigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power
laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the
universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of
correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical
structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been
extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument
supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this
problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic
structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse
trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English
corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic
context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as
in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the
assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to
apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting
the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical
structures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LPC的新框架，用于建模人类偏好的隐含因素及其组合，避免了传统方法依赖预定义奖励函数的局限性。实验表明，LPC能显著提升多种对齐算法的性能，并增强对数据噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有偏好建模方法多依赖显式或隐式奖励函数，忽略了人类偏好的复杂性与多面性。面对这一局限，作者希望开发一种能自动推断隐含因素及其组合的框架，从而更全面地捕捉人类偏好。

Method: 通过离散潜在编码（LPC）建模偏好隐含因素及其组合，无需依赖预定义奖励函数或手动权重，支持多种离线对齐算法（如DPO、SimPO、IPO）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LPC显著提升了三种对齐算法（DPO、SimPO、IPO）的性能，且学习到的潜在编码能有效区分偏好分布差异，增强对齐鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LPC为多元偏好因素提供了统一表征，为开发更稳健、通用的LLM对齐技术奠定了基础，有助于负责任地部署强大语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet aligning
their generations with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing
approaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward
function, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human
preferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and
populations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding
(LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their
combinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC
seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically
inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying
on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves
upon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models
(Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis
reveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in
the distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness
of alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for
the multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more
robust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of
powerful LLMs.

Conclusion: InvICL通过同时满足信息不泄漏和上下文相互依赖性，成功解决了ICL中的顺序敏感性问题，并在性能上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of
auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable
sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual
independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several
variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of
these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive
ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of
an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context
interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing
methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a
methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two
properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous
models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets,
showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

*Cedric Waterschoot,Nava Tintarev,Francesco Barile*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在基于零样本学习的群体推荐系统（GRS）中的应用，分析了不同条件下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型在不同条件下（如群体复杂性、提示格式等）正确执行群体推荐策略的能力，以优化推荐系统的效率和成本。

Method: 通过实验分析不同LLMs在群体复杂性（用户与物品数量）、提示条件（如上下文学习、生成解释等）和偏好格式下的准确性。

Result: 结果显示，性能在超过100个评分时开始下降，但不同模型对复杂性增长的敏感性不同。上下文学习能显著提高高复杂性下的性能，而其他提示修改对准确性无影响。

Conclusion: 未来研究应考虑群体复杂性对LLM性能的影响，并表明在适当条件下，小型LLMs可高效生成群体推荐，降低计算成本和资源消耗。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems
aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems
(GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single
recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we
investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies
correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the
group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the
impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,
different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating
explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that
performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.
However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group
complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can
significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,
while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting
for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research
should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect
on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios
differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All
in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group
recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller
models that require less computing power and costs.

Method: 提出多阶段影响函数并结合EK-FAC参数化高效近似计算，以适用于全参数微调的LLMs。对dolly-v2-3b等模型的案例分析验证了方法的实用性。

Result: EK-FAC近似显著提升了方法的可扩展性，多阶段影响函数能有效追踪预训练数据对下游任务预测的影响。案例展示了其在解释模型行为上的实际价值。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解预训练数据对微调后的LLMs预测的影响提供了可扩展且高效的分析工具，增强了模型透明度和解释性。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are commonly fine-tuned to adapt to
downstream tasks. Since the majority of knowledge is acquired during
pre-training, attributing the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to their
pre-training data may provide valuable insights. Influence functions have been
proposed as a means to explain model predictions based on training data.
However, existing approaches fail to compute ``multi-stage'' influence and lack
scalability to billion-scale LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-stage influence function to attribute the
downstream predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to pre-training data under the
full-parameter fine-tuning paradigm. To enhance the efficiency and practicality
of our multi-stage influence function, we leverage Eigenvalue-corrected
Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for efficient approximation.
Empirical results validate the superior scalability of EK-FAC approximation and
the effectiveness of our multi-stage influence function. Additionally, case
studies on a real-world LLM, dolly-v2-3b, demonstrate its interpretive power,
with exemplars illustrating insights provided by multi-stage influence
estimates. Our code is public at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的A/B测试评估UI设计说服力成本高且耗时，而现有视觉语言模型（VLM）方法未能有效比较设计的说服力。因此，需要一种高效且准确的替代方法。

Method: 提出WiserUI-Bench基准测试（包含300组真实UI图片对和标注数据），并设计G-FOCUS推理策略以减少位置偏差、提升评估准确性。

Result: 实验显示，G-FOCUS在一致性和准确性上优于现有推理策略，为UI说服力评估提供了更高效的工具。

Conclusion: 该研究为减少对A/B测试的依赖提供了新方法，推动了可扩展的UI偏好建模和设计优化的发展。

Abstract: Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics
to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B
testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive
higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current
approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative
persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this,
we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design
Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled
with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS,
a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based
persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation
accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference
strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through
promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an
approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI
preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released
publicly.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展引发了对恶意滥用的担忧，现有检测方法过于关注准确性而忽视了高误报率的社会风险，亟需一种能平衡FPR约束与检测性能的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于多尺度共形预测（MCP）的零样本机器生成文本检测框架，结合高质量跨领域数据集RealDet，实现FPR约束与检测性能的双重优化。

Result: 实证评估表明，MCP能有效约束FPR，显著提升检测性能，并在多种检测器和数据集中增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCP框架为机器生成文本检测提供了一种兼顾FPR约束与性能提升的可行方案，结合RealDet数据集展现了优越的实用性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant
concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result,
developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical
priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on
detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false
positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal
Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While
directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction
in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a
Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal
Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection
performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that
spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling
superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances
detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks
across multiple detectors and datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言大语言模型（LLMs）的机制，通过稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分解激活并评估特征的语言专一性，发现某些特征与特定语言密切相关，且去除这些特征仅显著影响一种语言的能力，部分语言存在协同特征，并利用这些特征提升语言控制的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于神经元或内部激活的研究方法在多语言LLMs分析中存在局限（如叠加和层间激活差异）。为了更精确地理解模型的多语言能力，研究希望通过SAEs揭示语言相关的特征及其作用。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分解LLMs的激活，提出新指标评估特征的“单语言性”，并通过特征去除（ablation）实验验证其语言专一性影响。进一步利用这些特征优化语言控制向量。

Result: 发现某些SAE特征与特定语言强相关，去除后仅显著影响该语言能力；部分语言存在协同特征，联合去除效果更强。基于特征优化的控制向量能更精准调控LLMs的输出语言。

Conclusion: SAEs为多语言LLMs的分析提供了更细粒度的工具，语言相关特征的发现及协同效应的揭示为模型解释和可控生成开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The mechanisms behind multilingual capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been examined using neuron-based or internal-activation-based
methods. However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and
layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the
activations of LLMs into sparse linear combination of SAE features. We
introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from
SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific
languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only
significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost
unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE
features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating
individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific
features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language
generated by LLMs.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social
media, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an
increasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing.
Despite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains
underexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges
include the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of
standardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER
framework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for
Urdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated
with Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by
evaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing
comparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER
framework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text
embeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion
Module to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Chinese large language models (LLMs) underscores the
need for domain-specific evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However,
existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited
insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a
unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the
first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of
Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical
domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely
align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive
evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with
Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the
importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements.
The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage
within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM
collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for
multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with
Federated Learning.

Result: 实验表明，T-T在降低计算成本的同时，作为关系学习模块实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: T-T通过创新的注意力机制设计，有效解决了Transformer在长序列任务中的瓶颈，为ASTE任务提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed
of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences.
The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which
encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of
relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing
various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions
between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture
relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we
attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning
modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it
is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to
the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the
input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:
overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the
tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention
mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former
modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local
attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different
attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the
T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art
performance with lower computational costs.

Result: 技术改进方案可能提升LLMs在论证对话中的效用。

Conclusion: 论证理论应成为LLM技术设计的基础，以支持更好的论证对话。

Abstract: In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational
technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative
processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are
inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at
enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to
exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the
concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of
relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative
dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in
argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based
technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法要么计算成本高，要么依赖人工启发式，无法充分挖掘数据内在属性，因此需要一种更高效且无偏的方法。

Method: ICon通过上下文学习的隐式学习性能变化来评估样本贡献，包含三个组件，无需梯度计算或人工指标设计。

Conclusion: ICon不仅能高效选择高质量数据，还能避免过度依赖最困难样本，提升了指令微调的效率和效果。

Abstract: Data selection for instruction tuning is essential for improving the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and reducing training cost.
However, existing automated selection methods either depend on computationally
expensive gradient-based measures or manually designed heuristics, which may
fail to fully exploit the intrinsic attributes of data. In this paper, we
propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel
gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of
in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient
computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally
efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive
bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components
and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under
implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12
benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of
ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data
outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of
widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze
high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and
appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.

concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases
compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in
both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis
reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs
tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In
addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across
different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher
biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation
strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news
content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了以英语为中心的长链思维（CoTs）微调模型在多语言推理中的泛化能力，发现扩展推理计算能提升低资源语言的数学推理能力，但跨领域推理表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言大语言模型在非英语语言中的推理能力，探索英语中心化微调对多语言任务的影响。

Method: 通过扩展推理计算、分析CoTs模式、控制推理语言策略，评估模型在多语言数学推理和文化常识任务中的表现。

Result: 模型在高资源语言中推理更高效，低资源语言表现有所提升，但跨领域（如STEM到文化常识）推理能力较差。

Conclusion: 建议在高资源语言中使用英语中心化模型进行推理，未来需改进低资源语言和跨领域的推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for
English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we
investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that
scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models
(RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages
including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models
twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are
naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think
pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an
effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we
observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource
languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in
particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English.
Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the
limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time
scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason
in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning
in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.

TL;DR: 研究发现，思维链（CoT）虽然在监测AI意图和推理过程中具有一定潜力，但其忠实性有限，尤其在提示使用和强化学习场景下效果不佳，无法完全排除意外行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨思维链（CoT）是否能忠实反映模型的真实推理过程，以评估其在AI安全监控中的有效性。

Method: 对6种推理提示下的最先进模型进行CoT忠实性评估，分析提示使用率、强化学习对忠实性的影响，以及奖励机制下的行为变化。

Result: CoT在多数情况下能部分揭示提示使用（1%-20%），强化学习初期提升忠实性但会停滞，奖励机制下提示使用频率增加但未伴随CoT表达提升。

Conclusion: CoT监控在训练和评估中有潜力但不足够，尤其在非必要推理场景下，难以可靠捕捉罕见或灾难性意外行为。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows
monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning
processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs
faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT
faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints
presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested,
CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the
hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement
learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and
(3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward
hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without
training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a
promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations,
but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in
settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring
of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected
behaviors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TransProQA，一个专门用于文学翻译评估的无参考LLM问答框架，解决了现有指标过度强调机械准确性而忽视艺术表达的问题，显著提升了评估性能并接近人工水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有翻译评估指标过于关注机械准确性，忽视了艺术表达和文化真实性，可能导致翻译质量的长期下降。因此，急需一种专门针对文学翻译的评估方法。

Method: 作者提出了TransProQA，一个基于LLM的无参考问答框架，结合了专业文学翻译者和研究者的见解，重点评估文学质量的关键要素，如文学手法、文化理解和作者声音。

Result: TransProQA在相关性（ACC-EQ和Kendall's tau）上提升了0.07，在适当性评估上超过现有最佳指标15分以上，并接近人类评估水平。

Conclusion: TransProQA作为一种无训练需求的文学评估指标，具有广泛适用性，能有效评估需本地处理的文本，是文学翻译评估的有力工具。

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary
domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy
over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being
superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this
bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural
authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary
evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based
question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary
translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from
professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical
elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural
understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while
literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially
outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ
and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by
over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator
insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of
translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation
performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad
applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b,
indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation
metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing
due to copyright or ethical considerations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个高效的数据过滤管道，解决模型驱动数据过滤中的验证策略和种子数据选择问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，数据质量成为提升模型性能的关键因素。然而，当前方法缺乏高效的数据验证策略，且种子数据选择依赖主观性较强的人工经验。

Method: 引入高效验证策略和优化的种子数据选择方法，构建基于fastText的轻量级分类器，形成数据过滤管道，应用于FineWeb和Chinese FineWeb数据集。

Result: 生成更高质量的Ultra-FineWeb数据集（包含约1万亿英文和1200亿中文token），训练出的模型在多任务基准测试中性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的数据过滤管道不仅提高了过滤效率和分类器质量，还显著降低了实验和推理成本，验证了其在提升数据质量和训练效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the
rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering
has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data.
However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data
verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data
quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks
clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of
subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient
verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on
LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge,
we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM
training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize
the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data
filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency,
classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental
and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we
employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the
filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese
FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb
dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120
billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on
Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple
benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both
data quality and training efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立评估对话系统的组件，缺乏对跨架构和配置的通用性洞察，因此需要一种灵活的框架来统一评估。

Method: 提出clem todd框架，支持插拔式集成，确保统一的评估标准，重新评估现有系统并整合新系统。

Result: 展示了clem todd的灵活性，提供了关于架构、规模和提示策略如何影响对话性能的实用见解。

Conclusion: clem todd为构建高效对话系统提供了实践指导，推动了对话系统评估的一致性。

Abstract: The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced
the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and
robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often
evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user
simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights
across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd
(chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a
flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under
consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across
combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models
from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration
and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational
constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing
task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three
newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results
provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting
strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for
building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型（VLM）中视觉感知与大型语言模型（LLM）推理能力的结合机制，探索跨模态模型融合的潜力。

Method: 采用跨模态模型融合方法，将LLMs的参数与VLMs合并，实验验证其在无需训练的情况下传递推理能力的效果。

Result: 融合模型成功将LLMs的推理能力转移到VLMs，并揭示了感知能力集中于早期层、推理能力由中后层主导的机制。融合后各层均参与推理，感知能力分布不变。

Conclusion: 模型融合是跨模态能力整合与机制理解的有效工具，为多模态研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general
capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain
poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning
through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike
previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose
merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities
from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged
models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how
merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly
encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely
facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all
layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception
abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed
light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration
and interpretation.

Motivation: 现有直接对齐方法存在冗余和似然偏移问题，尤其在噪声偏好对下表现不佳，因此需要一种更灵活、兼容性强的替代方案。

Method: 提出基于比较预言机的偏好对齐方法，提供基本方案的收敛保证，并通过启发式方法改进方案，实验验证其性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对似然边际差异的偏好对设计专用方法至关重要，补充了近期研究中的发现。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the
issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the
noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and
dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and
provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our
method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the
flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance
of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple
base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with
benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show
the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations
of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we
evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs
with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in
\citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

Abstract: The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for
high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful.
However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the
advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different
representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can
encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models.
Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text
encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal
symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a
fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the
combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution
Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model
in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We
show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN
and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap,
energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of
40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model
for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the
zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of
Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the
proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain
vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model
for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is
prohibitively expensive.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种框架，用于在训练数据存在噪声或缺失标签时进行稳健的不确定性量化，并分析了权重估计不准确时的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于训练数据中的标签可能因噪声或缺失而损坏，传统方法无法保证预测集的统计有效性，因此需要开发适应数据损坏的稳健方法。

Method: 论文分析了特权共形预测（PCP）在权重估计不准确时的稳健性，并提出了新的不确定插补（UI）方法，通过插补受损标签来保持其不确定性。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，PCP在权重不准确时仍有效，而UI方法无需依赖权重估计即可保持预测集的统计有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的三重稳健框架结合了PCP和UI方法，确保只要至少一种方法有效，即可生成统计有效的预测集。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in situations
where labeled training data are corrupted, through noisy or missing labels. We
build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction
sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity
of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does
not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this
distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed
leveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only
during training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid
prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this
work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our
analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even
when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain
imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight
estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their
uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated
empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these
techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring
statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is
valid.

Motivation: 标准DeepONet在处理输入函数时需固定采样位置，限制了其在可变传感器配置、缺失数据或不规则网格场景下的应用。SetONet旨在克服这一限制。

Method: SetONet采用分支网络处理输入函数的无序位置-值对集合，确保对输入点的排列不变性，从而增强对传感器数量和位置变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，SetONet能在变量输入采样条件下成功学习算子，且在固定网格上的性能优于或与DeepONet相当，尤其对非线性问题表现更优。

Conclusion: SetONet为神经算子工具箱提供了灵活且鲁棒的扩展，显著拓宽了算子学习在变量或不完整输入数据问题中的应用范围。

Abstract: Neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), have
shown promise in learning mappings between function spaces for solving
differential equations. However, standard DeepONet requires input functions to
be sampled at fixed locations, limiting its applicability in scenarios with
variable sensor configurations, missing data, or irregular grids. We introduce
the Set Operator Network (SetONet), a novel architecture that integrates Deep
Sets principles into the DeepONet framework to address this limitation. The
core innovation lies in the SetONet branch network, which processes the input
function as an unordered \emph{set} of location-value pairs. This design
ensures permutation invariance with respect to the input points, making SetONet
inherently robust to variations in the number and locations of sensors. SetONet
learns richer, spatially-aware input representations by explicitly processing
spatial coordinates and function values. We demonstrate SetONet's effectiveness
on several benchmark problems, including derivative/anti-derivative operators,
1D Darcy flow, and 2D elasticity. Results show that SetONet successfully learns
operators under variable input sampling conditions where standard DeepONet
fails. Furthermore, SetONet is architecturally robust to sensor drop-off;
unlike standard DeepONet, which requires methods like interpolation to function
with missing data. Notably, SetONet can achieve comparable or improved accuracy
over DeepONet on fixed grids, particularly for nonlinear problems, likely due
to its enhanced input representation. SetONet provides a flexible and robust
extension to the neural operator toolkit, significantly broadening the
applicability of operator learning to problems with variable or incomplete
input data.

Motivation: 研究动机在于重新定义数据‘质量’，探索在预训练阶段加入更多毒性数据是否能在后训练阶段提供更好的控制能力，从而降低模型输出的毒性。

Method: 方法包括通过小规模实验分析数据组成对特征表示空间的影响，并控制实验比较不同比例清洁与毒性数据训练的Olmo-1B模型的表现。

Result: 结果显示毒性数据使模型中毒性概念线性表示更清晰，虽然增加了基础模型的毒性输出，但后处理解毒更有效。在Toxigen和Real Toxicity Prompts数据集上验证，毒性数据训练的模型在解毒与性能间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: 结论指出，考虑后训练处理时，质量较差的数据也可能训练出更好的模型。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to
determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality"
from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we
explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better
control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.
First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the
geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled
experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic
data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear
representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show
that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,
it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real
Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better
trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general
capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention
(ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into
account, bad data may lead to good models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to contextual stochastic optimization,
integrating operations research and machine learning to address decision-making
under uncertainty. Traditional methods often fail to leverage contextual
information, which underscores the necessity for new algorithms. In this study,
we utilize neural networks with combinatorial optimization layers to encode
policies. Our goal is to minimize the empirical risk, which is estimated from
past data on uncertain parameters and contexts. To that end, we present a
surrogate learning problem and a generic primal-dual algorithm that is
applicable to various combinatorial settings in stochastic optimization. Our
approach extends classic Fenchel-Young loss results and introduces a new
regularization method using sparse perturbations on the distribution simplex.
This allows for tractable updates in the original space and can accommodate
diverse objective functions. We demonstrate the linear convergence of our
algorithm under certain conditions and provide a bound on the non-optimality of
the resulting policy in terms of the empirical risk. Experiments on a
contextual stochastic minimum weight spanning tree problem show that our
algorithm is efficient and scalable, achieving performance comparable to
imitation learning of solutions computed using an expensive Lagrangian-based
heuristic.

Conclusion: ViaSHAP通过学习直接计算Shapley值的函数，大幅提升了效率和解释准确性，为黑盒模型预测的解释提供了一种高效的方法。

Abstract: Shapley values have several desirable, theoretically well-supported,
properties for explaining black-box model predictions. Traditionally, Shapley
values are computed post-hoc, leading to additional computational cost at
inference time. To overcome this, a novel method, called ViaSHAP, is proposed,
that learns a function to compute Shapley values, from which the predictions
can be derived directly by summation. Two approaches to implement the proposed
method are explored; one based on the universal approximation theorem and the
other on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Results from a
large-scale empirical investigation are presented, showing that ViaSHAP using
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms for
tabular data. It is also shown that the explanations of ViaSHAP are
significantly more accurate than the popular approximator FastSHAP on both
tabular data and images.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of ML decision-making systems across products and services
has led to a set of regulations on how such systems should behave and be built.
Among all the technical challenges to enforcing these regulations, one crucial,
yet under-explored problem is the risk of manipulation while these systems are
being audited for fairness. This manipulation occurs when a platform
deliberately alters its answers to a regulator to pass an audit without
modifying its answers to other users. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach to manipulation-proof auditing by taking into account the auditor's
prior knowledge of the task solved by the platform. We first demonstrate that
regulators must not rely on public priors (e.g. a public dataset), as platforms
could easily fool the auditor in such cases. We then formally establish the
conditions under which an auditor can prevent audit manipulations using prior
knowledge about the ground truth. Finally, our experiments with two standard
datasets exemplify the maximum level of unfairness a platform can hide before
being detected as malicious. Our formalization and generalization of
manipulation-proof auditing with a prior opens up new research directions for
more robust fairness audits.

TL;DR: ORBIT-2 is a scalable foundation model for hyper-resolution climate downscaling, using lightweight Reslim architecture and TILES algorithm to achieve high efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of sparse observations and coarse-resolution models in regional decision-making, overcoming AI generalization issues and high computational complexity.

Method: Introduces Residual Slim ViT (Reslim) and TILES algorithm for lightweight, efficient processing and linear complexity scaling.

Result: Achieves strong scaling efficiency (92-98%), supports 0.9 km global resolution, and scores R^2 0.98-0.99 on benchmarks.

Conclusion: ORBIT-2 provides a robust solution for global climate downscaling with high accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective
regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling.
However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and
geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision
Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation
model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates
two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture
with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust
prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces
self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence
processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters
across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and
92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global
resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution
benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98
to 0.99 against observation data.

Motivation: 现有基于低阶多项式滤波器的谱GNN可能因多项式阶数不足而无法充分捕捉图的频谱特性，而增加阶数又带来计算成本高和性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出PieCoN，通过自适应划分频谱区间并结合常数谱滤波器与多项式滤波器，增强对频谱特性的学习能力。

Result: 在9个基准数据集（包括同质性和异质性图）上的实验表明，PieCoN在异质性数据集上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: PieCoN为图结构学习提供了更灵活的解决方案，尤其适用于复杂频谱特性的场景，展现了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various
domains by leveraging graph structures in data. Existing spectral GNNs, which
use low-degree polynomial filters to capture graph spectral properties, may not
fully identify the graph's spectral characteristics because of the polynomial's
small degree. However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally
expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or
degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph
Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant
spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to
leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into
intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be
effectively learned. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both
homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that PieCoN is particularly
effective on heterophilic datasets, highlighting its potential for a wide range
of applications.

Motivation: 当前缺乏一种灵活、可插拔的方法来在蛋白质工程中结合外部信息（如实验数据或分类器预测），以指导生成模型产生具备特定性质的蛋白质序列。

Method: ProteinGuide通过统一多种蛋白质生成模型（如掩码语言模型、自回归模型、扩散模型和流匹配模型），提出了一种统计条件化的方法，以结合预训练模型和辅助信息。

Conclusion: ProteinGuide为蛋白质工程提供了一个灵活、通用的条件化生成框架，能够整合多种外部信息以指导蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have begun to transform protein
engineering, yet no principled framework for conditioning on auxiliary
information in a plug-and-play manner exists; one may want to iteratively
incorporate experimental feedback, or make use of an existing classifier --
such as for predicting enzyme commission number -- in order to guide the
sampling of the generative model to generate sequences with desired properties.
Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a rigorous and general framework to achieve
just that: through unifying a broad class of protein generative models that
includes masked language, (order-agnostic) autoregressive, diffusion and
flow-matching models, we provide an approach to statistically condition
pre-trained protein generative models. We demonstrate applicability of our
approach by guiding each of two commonly used protein generative models,
ProteinMPNN and ESM3, to generate amino acid and structure token sequences
conditioned on several user-specified properties, namely, enhanced stability
and CATH-labeled fold generation.

Method: RL$^V$通过联合训练LLM作为推理器和生成验证器，利用RL生成的数据添加验证能力，无需显著增加开销。

Result: 实验表明，RL$^V$在并行采样下将MATH准确率提升超过20%，测试时计算效率比基础RL方法高$8-32×$，且对难易任务和跨域任务表现优异。

Conclusion: RL$^V$显著提升了RL方法的性能和计算效率，尤其在联合扩展并行和顺序计算时表现更优。

Abstract: Prevalent reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for fine-tuning LLM reasoners,
such as GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO, abandon the learned value function in favor
of empirically estimated returns. This hinders test-time compute scaling that
relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose
RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM
as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding
verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$
boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables
$8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL
method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both
easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves
$1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential
test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.

Conclusion: 文章总结了FL-CPS的主要挑战，并提出了未来研究方向，强调了这一领域的快速发展特性。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a
complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision
making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are
also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize
the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to
ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be
trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining
popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and
physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the
numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in
recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and
CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of
FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further
depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article
scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent
transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart
healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons
learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中因冗余内容导致的输出冗长问题，提升计算效率和用户体验。

Method: 提出ConCISE框架，基于置信度分析（如信心不足和终止延迟），通过置信度注入和提前终止技术优化推理链。

Result: 实验表明，ConCISE能减少约50%的输出长度，同时保持高任务准确率，并在多个推理基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ConCISE通过置信度引导的压缩技术，有效减少了冗余推理步骤，为大型推理模型的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but often suffer from verbose outputs caused
by redundant content, increasing computational overhead, and degrading user
experience. Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning,
risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection,
which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we
introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant
reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the
model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination
Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based
on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In
Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains
by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the
generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to
stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when
confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing
length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task
accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FedRE的联邦学习方法，旨在通过优化本地差分隐私（LDP）机制，针对不同客户端对隐私敏感信息（PSI）的不同需求分层分配隐私预算，从而在保护隐私的同时减少不必要的噪声干扰，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法在应用LDP时未能考虑不同客户端对隐私敏感信息（PSI）的不同需求，导致对非隐私敏感信息的过度保护引入了不必要的噪声，影响了模型性能。

Method: 提出FedRE方法，通过定义PSI并分层优化LDP隐私预算分配，设计基于扰动信息分布的参数聚合机制。

Result: 在T-SROIE和DocTamper数据集上的文本篡改检测实验中，FedRE表现出与现有先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: FedRE通过分层LDP优化和参数聚合机制，实现了隐私保护与模型性能的有效平衡。

Abstract: Despite Federated Learning (FL) employing gradient aggregation at the server
for distributed training to prevent the privacy leakage of raw data, private
information can still be divulged through the analysis of uploaded gradients
from clients. Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local
differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy
guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account
by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may
have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI),
which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case,
excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can
additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model
performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that
can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP
protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy
preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less
privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus
providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the
performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation
mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted
experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and
FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 理解细胞间通讯（CCC）对揭示细胞功能至关重要，但传统VAE模型未能有效利用CCC信号，因此需要一种新的方法将这些生物先验知识融入单细胞分析。

Method: 作者开发了CCCVAE，通过结合配体-受体相互作用的通讯感知核和稀疏高斯过程，将CCC信号嵌入潜空间，使潜表示能同时反映转录相似性和细胞间通讯背景。

Result: 在四个scRNA-seq数据集上的实验表明，CCCVAE的聚类性能优于标准VAE基线，验证了生物先验嵌入对单细胞分析的价值。

Conclusion: CCCVAE通过整合CCC信号改进了单细胞数据的潜表示学习，证明了在深度生成模型中嵌入生物先验对无监督单细胞分析的有效性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular
heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological
function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling
interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular
behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role
in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune
response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information
about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational
autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell
representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived
from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes
biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs
that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to
reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context.
Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves
clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE
baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into
deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 5G has transformed vehicular networks, offering high
bandwidth, low latency, and fast data rates essential for real-time
applications in smart cities and vehicles. These improvements enhance traffic
safety and entertainment services. However, the limited coverage and frequent
handovers in 5G networks cause network instability, especially in high-mobility
environments due to the ping-pong effect. This paper presents TH-GCN
(Throughput-oriented Graph Convolutional Network), a novel approach for
optimizing handover management in dense 5G networks. Using graph neural
networks (GNNs), TH-GCN models vehicles and base stations as nodes in a dynamic
graph enriched with features such as signal quality, throughput, vehicle speed,
and base station load. By integrating both user equipment and base station
perspectives, this dual-centric approach enables adaptive, real-time handover
decisions that improve network stability. Simulation results show that TH-GCN
reduces handovers by up to 78 percent and improves signal quality by 10

Conclusion: 该理论为有限宽度神经网络的梯度下降提供了新的分析框架，并在统计应用和模型结构理解上提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization
of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the
canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional
regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while
the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution
theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration
in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.
  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF)
theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory
operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are
fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from
individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF
are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies
on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both
training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks
beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study
generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.
  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be
augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each
iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning.
As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model
misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure
of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear
combination of the true signal and the initialization.

Result: 在跨位置和跨设备场景下，VaCDA的表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VaCDA能有效缓解传感器数据的异质性，提升跨域活动识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Technological advancements have led to the rise of wearable devices with
sensors that continuously monitor user activities, generating vast amounts of
unlabeled data. This data is challenging to interpret, and manual annotation is
labor-intensive and error-prone. Additionally, data distribution is often
heterogeneous due to device placement, type, and user behavior variations. As a
result, traditional transfer learning methods perform suboptimally, making it
difficult to recognize daily activities. To address these challenges, we use a
variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a shared, low-dimensional latent space
from available sensor data. This space generalizes data across diverse sensors,
mitigating heterogeneity and aiding robust adaptation to the target domain. We
integrate contrastive learning to enhance feature representation by aligning
instances of the same class across domains while separating different classes.
We propose Variational Contrastive Domain Adaptation (VaCDA), a multi-source
domain adaptation framework combining VAEs and contrastive learning to improve
feature representation and reduce heterogeneity between source and target
domains. We evaluate VaCDA on multiple publicly available datasets across three
heterogeneity scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, and cross-device. VaCDA
outperforms the baselines in cross-position and cross-device scenarios.

Result: 在5.625°分辨率的ERA5数据集上，PASSAT表现优于现有深度学习和数值天气预测模型。

Conclusion: PASSAT成功整合物理和拓扑信息，提升了天气预测的准确性。

Abstract: Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in
weather prediction, most of them overlook either the \textbf{physics} of the
underlying weather evolution or the \textbf{topology} of the Earth's surface.
In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted
And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT
attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process
that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes
equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model
and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into
consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these
considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the
Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph
neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the
initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation
from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution
ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based
weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction

Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both
predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic
groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable
depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted
increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of
uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we
investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage
(EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for
depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions
through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants
by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify
uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically
guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and
facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups.
Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates
fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This
enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the
heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving
optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio
depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly popular across various
scientific disciplines for their ability to model and interlink huge quantities
of data, essentially all real-world KGs are known to be incomplete. As such,
with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning
tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as
the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to
date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed
that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual)
vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge
embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.
  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to
link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs
and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective
that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather
than individual nodes and edges.
  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis
concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both
viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG
transfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to
create and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that
link prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.
  All code and data used for this thesis are open-sourced. This thesis was
written bilingually, with the main document in English and an informal extended
summary in Irish. An Irish-language translation dictionary of machine learning
terms (the Focl\'oir Tr\'achtais) created for this work is open-sourced as
well.

TL;DR: 论文提出Graffe，一种自监督扩散模型，用于图表示学习，理论证明去噪目标隐含地最大化数据与其表示的条件互信息，并在11个真实数据集中的9个上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型（DPMs）在生成高质量样本方面潜力显著，但在表示学习领域未被充分关注。本文旨在通过Graffe模型，探索DPMs在图表示学习中的应用。

Method: Graffe采用自监督扩散模型，通过图编码器提取图的紧凑表示，并以此作为条件指导扩散解码器的去噪过程。理论分析表明，去噪目标隐含最大化条件互信息。

Result: 实验验证了理论分析，Graffe在节点和图分类任务中表现出色，11个真实数据集中的9个达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 强大生成模型（如扩散模型）是图表示学习的有效工具，Graffe的成功为DPMs在该领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), widely recognized for their potential
to generate high-quality samples, tend to go unnoticed in representation
learning. While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing
visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its
infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model
proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that
distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves
as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical
foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving
that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual
information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that
the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable
lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a
series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition,
Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node
and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of
the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative
models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph
representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散变换方法依赖于对数据集特性的了解，当这些知识不可得时效果不佳。

Method: 提出了GT，一种数据驱动的自适应变换表示方法。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中，使用GT的模型表现优于传统变换方法。

Conclusion: GT在多样化学习场景中表现出有效性，为机器学习的特征提取提供了新方向。

Abstract: Discrete transforms, such as the discrete Fourier transform, are widely used
in machine learning to improve model performance by extracting meaningful
features. However, with numerous transforms available, selecting an appropriate
one often depends on understanding the dataset's properties, making the
approach less effective when such knowledge is unavailable. In this work, we
propose General Transform (GT), an adaptive transform-based representation
designed for machine learning applications. Unlike conventional transforms, GT
learns data-driven mapping tailored to the dataset and task of interest. Here,
we demonstrate that models incorporating GT outperform conventional
transform-based approaches across computer vision and natural language
processing tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in diverse learning scenarios.

*Zhifeng Hu,Chong Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）和深度强化学习（DRL）的算法（GLOVE），用于动态太赫兹（THz）无人机（UAV）网络中的资源分配问题，以最大化资源效率并降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态拓扑结构使得太赫兹无人机网络中长期的联合功率和天线阵列资源分配问题变得复杂，这是一个混合整数非线性规划（MINLP）问题，具有非凸性和NP难度。

Method: GLOVE算法利用GNN捕捉无人机与其邻居之间的关系，并强调自身节点特征，同时采用多任务结构协同训练功率和子阵列资源分配决策。

Result: 实验表明，GLOVE在资源效率和延迟方面优于基准方案，并且在训练过程中保持零丢包，显示出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLOVE算法在动态的太赫兹无人机网络中表现出卓越的性能和鲁棒性，为资源分配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with flexible
topologies and ultra-high data rates are expected to empower numerous
applications in security surveillance, disaster response, and environmental
monitoring, among others. However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient
long-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among
UAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of
antennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness.
Inspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a
graph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the
dynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is
proposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization.
When training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship
between this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the
important self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure
is leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for
the power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that
GLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest
latency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE
maintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating
its better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索键盘动态行为在多因素认证中的潜力，评估其在不同键盘硬件上的适用性。

Method: 使用基于代理的模型生成合成击键数据，并通过OC-SVM和随机森林模型进行用户验证。

Result: 随机森林在单一键盘内认证准确率超过0.7，但跨键盘表现不佳；OC-SVM则无法有效区分用户。

Conclusion: 建议针对特定键盘创建用户认证模板，并优先选择集成方法如随机森林以提高认证可靠性。

Abstract: Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics
offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication
setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience.
This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an
Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical
and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data
from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time,
and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two
machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and
Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a
stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate
individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust
intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize
across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of
keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1)
keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication,
and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing
fine-grained user-specific patterns.

Motivation: 解决合成临床数据在隐私保护与数据可用性之间的平衡问题，提升合成数据的保真度和实用性。

Method: 比较了单一指标与复合指标优化策略，测试了八种生成模型，并评估了预处理和后处理的影响。

Result: HPO显著提升数据质量，TVAE等模型提升达60%；复合指标优化表现更优，但需结合域知识确保临床有效性。

Conclusion: HPO结合预处理和后处理是生成高质量合成临床数据的关键，未来需优化指标选择并扩大验证规模。

Abstract: The generation of synthetic clinical trial data offers a promising approach
to mitigating privacy concerns and data accessibility limitations in medical
research. However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity,
utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge.
While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative
model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for
synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates
four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric
optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results
demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE,
CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%,
respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric
strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets.
Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic
data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints.
Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these
violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in
up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating
explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic
datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic
data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and
validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability.

Motivation: 为了解决递归层在建模长序列时的挑战，并保持参数量恒定，同时提升对长程时序依赖的建模效率。

Method: 采用变分自编码器（VAE）和递归层，引入逐步增加序列长度的训练方案（RVAE-ST）。

Result: 模型在准周期结构的时序数据上表现优异，在非平稳或不规则数据集上仍具竞争力，评估指标包括ELBO、Fréchet距离等。

Conclusion: 通过组合现有组件并优化训练方案，RVAE-ST在时序生成任务中展现了高效性和竞争力。

Abstract: We present a simple yet effective generative model for time series data based
on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with recurrent layers, referred to as the
Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Subsequent Training (RVAE-ST). Our
method introduces an adapted training scheme that progressively increases the
sequence length, addressing the challenge recurrent layers typically face when
modeling long sequences. By leveraging the recurrent architecture, the model
maintains a constant number of parameters regardless of sequence length. This
design encourages approximate time-shift equivariance and enables efficient
modeling of long-range temporal dependencies. Rather than introducing a
fundamentally new architecture, we show that a carefully composed combination
of known components can match or outperform state-of-the-art generative models
on several benchmark datasets. Our model performs particularly well on time
series that exhibit quasi-periodic structure,while remaining competitive on
datasets with more irregular or partially non-stationary behavior. We evaluate
its performance using ELBO, Fr\'echet Distance, discriminative scores, and
visualizations of the learned embeddings.

Result: 理论证明了均匀逼近和有界时间分数，实验在互信息和密度估计任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: $\text{D}^3\text{RE}$框架通过新的插值方法显著提高了密度比估计的稳健性和效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences,
yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or
inadequately overlap supports, suffering from the \textit{density-chasm} and
the \textit{support-chasm} problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield
divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We propose
$\text{D}^3\text{RE}$, a unified framework for robust and efficient density
ratio estimation. It introduces the Dequantified Diffusion-Bridge Interpolant
(DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion
bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the Dequantified
Schr\"odinger-Bridge Interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve
the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method
offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms
baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Abstract: Project and task scheduling under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge
in program and project management, where accurate estimation of task durations
and dependencies is critical for delivering complex, multi project systems. The
Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to
model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a
novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a
Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and
precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks
inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent
schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy
function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends
the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on
synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the
viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal
constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models
offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling
under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based
applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.

Motivation: 现有基准测试仅在英语提示下评估LLMs，忽略了多语言开发者实际使用混合语言与LLMs交互的场景，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 基于BigCodeBench，CodeMixBench在三个语言对（Hinglish、西班牙语-英语、中文拼音-英语）的自然语言部分引入受控代码混合（CMD），评估多种开源代码生成模型（1.5B至15B参数）。

Result: 混合提示下Pass@1性能普遍下降，且小型模型在高CMD水平下性能下降更明显。

Conclusion: CodeMixBench为多语言代码生成提供了更真实的评估框架，并揭示了构建跨语言鲁棒代码生成模型的新挑战和方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation tasks, powering various applications like code completion,
debugging, and programming assistance. However, existing benchmarks such as
HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only
prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers
often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap,
we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon
BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the
natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish
(Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We
comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models
ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts
consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only
counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for
smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for
studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and
directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well
across diverse linguistic settings.

Conclusion: WaterDrum为LLM遗忘提供了更准确的评估工具，数据集的发布有助于进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning is critical in real-world applications
where it is necessary to efficiently remove the influence of private,
copyrighted, or harmful data from some users. However, existing utility-centric
unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the
extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and
retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from
scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can
improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the
LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs
called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these
limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that
contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously
evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lululu008/WaterDrum and our new benchmark datasets are
released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Glow-AI/WaterDrum-Ax.

Conclusion: ItDPDM通过离散空间的直接建模和精确损失计算，显著优于现有基线，为离散数据生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic
music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete
inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only
approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have
individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian
diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still
perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the
Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which
simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete
state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival
processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss
(PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative
log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower
bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the
CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant
improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while
also achieving faster convergence.

to vanilla training, while also reducing overall training FLOPs up to
$1.86\times$ when evaluated on traditional benchmarks.

remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by
combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this
discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework

computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL

### [84] [Balancing Client Participation in Federated Learning Using AoI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05099)
*Alireza Javani,Zhiying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息年龄（AoI）的客户端选择策略，通过优化选择间隔来减少负载不均，提升联邦学习的效率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在数据隐私保护方面具有优势，但面临通信资源有限、统计异质性和客户端参与不均衡等挑战。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用去中心化的Markov调度策略，客户端根据年龄相关的选择概率自主决定参与，平衡训练轮次中的更新，减少中心化干预。

Result: 通过仿真验证，AoI方法在IID和非IID数据场景下分别比FedAvg提升7.5%和最高20%的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 基于AoI的调度策略能有效提升FL系统的可扩展性、公平性和效率，适用于多样化学习环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data
privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients.
However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication
resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client
participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client
selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance
through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized
Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage
participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances
client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We
provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures
stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal
parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent
client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence
stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based
method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the
FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\%$
and up to $20\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based
scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning
environments.

*Chuanbo Hua,Federico Berto,Zhikai Zhao,Jiwoo Son,Changhyun Kwon,Jinkyoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了USPR，一种能够统一处理任意车辆-客户配置的框架，解决了现有强化学习方法在泛化性和灵活性上的不足，通过嵌入、注意力机制和动态分数调整实现了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理车辆-客户特定配置时需重复训练，泛化性差且灵活性不足，无法应对现实中的多样化需求（如区域限制、服务偏好）。

Method: USPR框架包含三项创新：(1) 配置嵌入（PE）编码任意配置组合；(2) 多头部配置注意力（MHPA）建模车辆-客户交互；(3) 配置感知分数重塑（PSR）动态调整解码逻辑以提高泛化性。

Result: 在多种PVRP基准测试中，USPR取得了基于学习方法的最优结果，同时在灵活性和计算效率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: USPR通过统一框架有效解决了配置多样性问题，为实际应用提供了高效且通用的解决方案，并为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: The Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) extends the classical VRP by
incorporating vehicle-client-specific preferences and constraints, reflecting
real-world requirements such as zone restrictions and service-level
preferences. While recent reinforcement learning (RL) solvers have shown
promise, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from
poor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution
instances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing USPR
(Unified Solver for Profiled Routing), a novel framework that natively handles
arbitrary profile types. USPR introduces three key innovations: (i) Profile
Embeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head
Profiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions
between vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which
dynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve
generalization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that
USPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while
offering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency. We make
our source code publicly available to foster future research at

*Xuyang Chen,Keyu Yan,Lin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于优势扩散的Actor-Critic（ADAC）方法，通过系统评估和调制优势函数来应对离线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习由于无法在线交互，常因分布偏移导致对分布外动作的评估不准确。现有方法过于保守，阻碍了对有益动作的利用。ADAC旨在通过优势调制更精确评估动作质量。

Method: ADAC使用批量最优值函数系统评估分布外动作，定义优势函数调制Q函数更新，从而实现对动作质量的更精准评估。

Result: 在自定义PointMaze环境和D4RL基准测试中，ADAC在几乎所有任务上达到最先进性能，且在更具挑战性的任务上优势明显。

Conclusion: ADAC通过优势调制有效解决了离线强化学习中的分布偏移问题，显著提升了算法的泛化能力和任务表现。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies
from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution
where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often
suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and
substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address
this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately
discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to
generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose
Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that
systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function.
Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the
Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We
design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal
that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD
actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear
margins on the more challenging tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining,
with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and
clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling
and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling
complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the
potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel
framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)
to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed
method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and
reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of
reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To
enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature
extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling
the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the
data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and
UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse
data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models
in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过排列稀疏掩码对齐优化盆地的方法，显著提高了从随机初始化开始的稀疏训练泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现彩票假设（LTH）的稀疏掩码无法推广到其他随机权重初始化，推测原因是优化盆地未对齐。因此，本文试图通过排列掩码解决这一问题。

Method: 提出在稀疏训练时对LTH掩码进行排列，以对齐新的优化盆地。实验在多个数据集（CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet）和模型（VGG11、ResNet20和ResNet50）上验证了方法的有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用排列后的LTH掩码进行稀疏训练时，泛化性能显著优于未排列的掩码。

Conclusion: 通过排列稀疏掩码对齐优化盆地，可以有效提升从随机初始化开始的稀疏训练泛化性能。

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask
and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model
while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is
computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other
random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks
trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo
permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss
basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks
do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH
mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training
from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in
generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the
permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and
ResNet50).

Motivation: 探索语言模型如何通过少量示例学习，并理解其在Transformer前向传播中的具体实现机制。

Method: 使用结构化任务（输入加整数k）测试Llama-3-8B的少量学习能力，通过优化方法定位关键注意力头，分析信号子空间。

Result: 模型在特定三个注意力头上表现优异，信号集中在六维子空间（单位数字和整体大小），并发现自校正机制。

Conclusion: 通过跟踪低维子空间，可以揭示模型前向传播中细粒度计算结构的洞察。

Abstract: To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from
individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule,
and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the
forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a
structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule
is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high
accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to
just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show
the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the
dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall
magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from
individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which
mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results
demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can
provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出 FedTDP，一个利用大语言模型（LLMs）在联邦环境中进行轨迹数据准备的隐私保护和统一框架，通过自编码器和知识增强器提升数据质量与隐私保护，并在多项实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹数据准备（TDP）方法存在隐私保护不足和缺乏通用性的问题，尤其在联邦环境中数据共享受限，亟需一种既能保护隐私又能广泛适用的解决方案。

Method: FedTDP 框架结合轨迹隐私自编码器保护数据隐私，轨迹知识增强器提升模型学习 TDP 知识的能力，并通过联邦并行优化提高训练效率。

Result: 在 6 个真实数据集和 10 项主流 TDP 任务上的实验表明，FedTDP 在性能上优于 13 种现有先进方法。

Conclusion: FedTDP 成功解决了 TDP 中的隐私和通用性问题，为联邦环境下的轨迹数据应用提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles
over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and
urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often
compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting
the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP)
can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i)
they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings
where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design
task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios.
To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and
unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a
trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy,
(ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of
TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii)
propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by
reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on
6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP
consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个新的决策问题——Bandit Max-Min公平分配问题（BMMFA），目标是通过重复分配不可分割商品来最大化代理的最小效用。与现有工作不同，代理对商品的估值只能通过半赌博反馈观察，且奖励函数在各轮次间不具可加性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究中，商品的估值通常在每轮开始时提供，而本文关注的是通过半赌博反馈观察估值的情况，同时处理非加性奖励函数的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种新算法，结合了赌博技术和竞争分析中的资源分配算法，实现了$O(m\sqrt{T}\ln T/n + m\sqrt{T \ln(mnT)})$的渐进后悔上限。

Result: 算法在时间范围$T$足够大时，其上界与下界$\Omega(m\sqrt{T}/n)$之间的差距为$T$的对数因子。

Conclusion: 本文不仅提出了解决BMMFA问题的新算法，还提供了其后悔下界，填补了理论与实际性能之间的差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a new decision-making problem called the bandit
max-min fair allocation (BMMFA) problem. The goal of this problem is to
maximize the minimum utility among agents with additive valuations by
repeatedly assigning indivisible goods to them. One key feature of this problem
is that each agent's valuation for each item can only be observed through the
semi-bandit feedback, while existing work supposes that the item values are
provided at the beginning of each round. Another key feature is that the
algorithm's reward function is not additive with respect to rounds, unlike most
bandit-setting problems.
  Our first contribution is to propose an algorithm that has an asymptotic
regret bound of $O(m\sqrt{T}\ln T/n + m\sqrt{T \ln(mnT)})$, where $n$ is the
number of agents, $m$ is the number of items, and $T$ is the time horizon. This
is based on a novel combination of bandit techniques and a resource allocation
algorithm studied in the literature on competitive analysis. Our second
contribution is to provide the regret lower bound of $\Omega(m\sqrt{T}/n)$.
When $T$ is sufficiently larger than $n$, the gap between the upper and lower
bounds is a logarithmic factor of $T$.

*Cong Hua,Qianqian Xu,Zhiyong Yang,Zitai Wang,Shilong Bao,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt tuning adapts CLIP for open-world tasks, but current metrics fail to assess both domain detection and classification simultaneously. The paper proposes OpenworldAUC for unified evaluation and GMoP for dynamic prompt tuning, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world scenarios require models to handle inputs without prior domain knowledge, which current metrics and methods fail to address comprehensively.

Method: Proposes OpenworldAUC for unified evaluation and GMoP, a gated mixture-of-prompts method, to dynamically balance domain detection and classification.

Result: GMoP achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: OpenworldAUC and GMoP provide a robust solution for open-world prompt tuning, addressing limitations of current metrics and methods.

Abstract: Prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models like CLIP to open-world tasks
with minimal training costs. In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates
model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen
classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to
handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has
spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified
evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or
new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2).
What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric
should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find
that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to
satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose
OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and
classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC
effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs
domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection
and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under
practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show
GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release
the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为随机变分传播（SVP）的可扩展替代方案，通过分层变分推断重新定义训练，减少内存使用并提高可扩展性，同时保持与传统反向传播相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播（BP）虽然对深度学习至关重要，但其依赖全局梯度同步限制了可扩展性并带来显著的内存开销。为解决这个问题，作者提出了SVP。

Method: SVP将层激活视为潜变量，通过优化局部证据下限（ELBO）实现独立、局部更新。为避免层间表示崩溃，使用固定的随机矩阵将激活投影到低维空间，并结合特征对齐损失保证层间一致性。

Result: SVP在多种架构（MLP、CNN、Transformer）和数据集（MNIST到ImageNet）上达到了与BP相当的准确性，内存使用减少了4倍，显著提升了可扩展性。

Conclusion: SVP为深度表示学习引入了一种概率视角，为更具模块化和可解释性的神经网络设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on
global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant
memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a
scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational
inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local
Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while
preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in
layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive
compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional
spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and
representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for
inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to
ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves
scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep
representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable
neural network design.

Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by
controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling
watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified
model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor
in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed
watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we
reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing
a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic
efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA),
which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each
token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our
work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking
algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack
success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per
million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark
algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the
attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need
for more robust watermarking.

Abstract: Estimating long-term causal effects by combining long-term observational and
short-term experimental data is a crucial but challenging problem in many
real-world scenarios. In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g.
latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias
assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the
observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are
typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper,
we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects
without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the
natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify
latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized
assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based
estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the
identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term
effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple
synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Result: 实验表明CUDA显著优于现有CBM和域适应方法。

Conclusion: CUDA框架有效提升CBMs在域适应中的性能，兼具解释性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining
predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that
training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails
under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization.
To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the
Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed
to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial
training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific
differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due
to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the
target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to
diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain
adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and
establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world
datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the radio resource allocation problem in a wireless
system with various integrated functionalities, such as communication, sensing
and computing. We design suitable resource management techniques that can
simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale
appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We
propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns
are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to
iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a
generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such
models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their
training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such,
GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that
update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide
simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources
achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than
half of the number of acquisition rounds.

Motivation: 解决AutoML中组合算法选择和超参数优化（CASH）的高资源消耗问题，提出一种更高效的替代方法。

Method: 提出MaxUCB，一种max $k$-armed bandit方法，专为轻尾和有界奖励分布设计，平衡探索不同模型类和超参数优化。

Result: 在四个标准AutoML基准上，MaxUCB在理论和实验性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MaxUCB为CASH问题提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于轻尾奖励分布场景，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH) is a
challenging resource allocation problem in the field of AutoML. We propose
MaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model
classes and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically
designed for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this
setting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max
$k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We
theoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML
benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Latte的框架，用于在少量标记数据的情况下进行表格学习，通过训练时从大型语言模型（LLMs）中提取潜知识来优化下游模型，解决了现有方法在测试时知识提取或文本级知识利用上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: Latte通过将LLMs中的潜知识转移到下游模型，实现广义的知识引导学习，支持不同特征值信息的加权融合，并减少对有限标记数据的过拟合。此外，Latte兼容现有的无监督预训练范式，能有效利用未标记样本。

Conclusion: Latte通过训练时提取LLMs潜知识，有效优化了少量表格学习任务，并在实验中证明了其卓越性能，成为该领域的标杆方法。

Abstract: Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with
a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to
addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot
tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on
test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or
text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge
extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to
optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general
knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion
of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of
overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with
existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available
unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an
extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot
tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte,
establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于主动学习的方法FCCM，用于在有限标注预算下高效估计治疗效果，通过优化覆盖半径降低风险上界，在合成和半合成数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于治疗后效果标注成本高（如肿瘤影像或活检），现有算法在标注数据不足时效果受限，因此需在有限预算下主动获取高质量标注数据。

Method: 理论分析了主动学习框架下的风险上界，提出贪心半径缩减算法及FCCM方法，通过最大化事实与反事实覆盖优化数据采集。

Result: FCCM在合成和半合成数据集上均优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: FCCM通过主动学习策略显著提升了有限标注预算下的治疗效果估计效率。

Abstract: Although numerous complex algorithms for treatment effect estimation have
been developed in recent years, their effectiveness remains limited when
handling insufficiently labeled training sets due to the high cost of labeling
the effect after treatment, e.g., expensive tumor imaging or biopsy procedures
needed to evaluate treatment effects. Therefore, it becomes essential to
actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a
constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect
estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis
within the active learning context, where the derived key measures --
\textit{factual} and \textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk
upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction
algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To
generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which
transforms the optimization objective into the \textit{Factual} and
\textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius
reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other
baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets.

Result: 实验显示，SMPE在MPE、LBF和RWARE基准测试的复杂全协作任务中优于现有最佳MARL算法。

Conclusion: SMPE通过新颖的状态建模和探索策略显著提升了多智能体在无通信部分可观测环境中的协作能力。

Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with
no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this
domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent
observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents'
exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose
a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer
meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to
optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative
joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE
algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities
under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the
policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration
policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while
improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that
SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative
tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不可学习策略主要针对单任务学习，忽视了多任务学习和通用模型的趋势，MTL-UE填补了这一空白。

Method: 采用基于生成器的结构，引入标签先验和类特征嵌入，并结合任务内和任务间嵌入正则化。

Result: 在4个MTL数据集、3种基础UE方法、5种模型架构和5种MTL任务加权策略上表现优越。

Conclusion: MTL-UE为多任务场景提供了高效、通用的不可学习样本生成方案。

Abstract: Most existing unlearnable strategies focus on preventing unauthorized users
from training single-task learning (STL) models with personal data.
Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and
multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can
handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL
data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable
strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for
generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of
optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure
that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to
much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task
and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and
suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly.
Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks
in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing
surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive
experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance
consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5
MTL task-weighting strategies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CBPE的新方法，用于估计二元分类任务中的任何基于混淆矩阵的性能指标，无需真实标签，填补了该领域的研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的模型性能监控需要真实标签，但在实际应用中往往无法及时获取，导致性能监控延迟或无法进行。现有方法虽能估计准确率，但忽略了其他重要指标，如精确率、召回率和F1分数。

Method: CBPE将混淆矩阵元素视为随机变量，利用模型的校准置信度分数估计其分布，进而推导目标性能指标的全概率分布。

Result: CBPE能生成具有强理论保证和有效置信区间的性能指标估计，尤以准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数为示例展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: CBPE为无标签场景下的模型性能监控提供了灵活且理论上可靠的解决方案，扩展了现有方法的应用范围。

Abstract: Model monitoring is a critical component of the machine learning lifecycle,
safeguarding against undetected drops in the model's performance after
deployment. Traditionally, performance monitoring has required access to ground
truth labels, which are not always readily available. This can result in
unacceptable latency or render performance monitoring altogether impossible.
Recently, methods designed to estimate the accuracy of classifier models
without access to labels have shown promising results. However, there are
various other metrics that might be more suitable for assessing model
performance in many cases. Until now, none of these important metrics has
received similar interest from the scientific community. In this work, we
address this gap by presenting CBPE, a novel method that can estimate any
binary classification metric defined using the confusion matrix. In particular,
we choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and
F$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion
matrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the
model to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated
as a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from
the estimated confusion matrix. CBPE is shown to produce estimates that come
with strong theoretical guarantees and valid confidence intervals.

TL;DR: Elastic Reasoning框架通过将推理分为思考和解两阶段，并独立分配资源，显著提升了在严格资源约束下的推理可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型推理模型在输出长度不受控制时难以满足实际部署中严格的资源限制问题。

Method: 提出Elastic Reasoning框架，将推理分为思考和解答两阶段，并采用预算约束的rollout策略训练模型，使其在资源有限时仍能有效推理。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，Elastic Reasoning在严格资源限制下表现稳健，且训练成本低于基线方法。

Conclusion: Elastic Reasoning为大规模可控推理提供了一种原则性且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex
tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their
uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are
strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for
scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two
phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test
time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments,
significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train
models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight
budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the
model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and
generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional
training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming
(LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning
performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring
significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our
approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in
unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical
solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLP设置下部分信息的学习问题，即训练集中的样本被分组为多包（bags），且只能获取每个包的聚合标签值，但仍希望在小样本情况下实现个体级别的低后悔（regret）。

Method: 方法包括改进的经验风险最小化（Empirical Risk Minimization）和随机梯度下降（Stochastic Gradient Descent）算法，并结合特定的方差减少技术。

Result: 理论结果表明，样本复杂度在包大小依赖性方面优于现有文献，同时多个数据集的实验验证了算法在样本效率（以更少样本获得更高准确率）上的提升。

Conclusion: 结论表明，所提出的算法在理论和实际性能上均优于现有基线，尤其在样本复杂度的优化和方差控制方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: We investigate Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a partial information
setting where examples in a training set are grouped into bags, and only
aggregate label values in each bag are available. Despite the partial
observability, the goal is still to achieve small regret at the level of
individual examples. We give results on the sample complexity of LLP under
square loss, showing that our sample complexity is essentially optimal. From an
algorithmic viewpoint, we rely on carefully designed variants of Empirical Risk
Minimization, and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, combined with ad hoc
variance reduction techniques. On one hand, our theoretical results improve in
important ways on the existing literature on LLP, specifically in the way the
sample complexity depends on the bag size. On the other hand, we validate our
algorithmic solutions on several datasets, demonstrating improved empirical
performance (better accuracy for less samples) against recent baselines.

Result: 在弗吉尼亚东海岸的数据集上，DIFF-FLOOD在预测性能（两个指标提升6%至64%）和可扩展性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIFF-FLOOD为沿海洪水预测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，显著提高了预测准确性。

Abstract: Coastal flooding poses significant risks to communities, necessitating fast
and accurate forecasting methods to mitigate potential damage. To approach this
problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting
method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts
inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into
account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital
elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time
window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context.
Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed
to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested
DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a
region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD
outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6%
to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的sharpness衡量方法，通过考虑Transformer中的对称性，重新定义基于商流形的sharpness概念，从而恢复其与泛化能力的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的sharpness衡量方法对传统架构（如MLP和CNN）有效，但在Transformer中由于参数空间的对称性丰富，无法准确预测泛化能力，因此需要改进。

Method: 通过Riemannian几何工具，提出在商流形上定义sharpness的方法，消除对称性歧义，并通过高阶近似计算geodesic sharpness。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界的Transformer任务（如文本和图像分类）中，新方法展现出sharpness与泛化能力的强相关性。

Conclusion: 研究证实，考虑对称性并改进sharpness定义是准确预测Transformer泛化能力的关键。

Abstract: The concept of sharpness has been successfully applied to traditional
architectures like MLPs and CNNs to predict their generalization. For
transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness
and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for
transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention
mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or
its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these
symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from
quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities.
Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of
sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient
manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing
so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we
demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation
with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic
data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for
real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的超维计算方法通常需要高精度模型或编码矩阵，导致计算和内存需求高，尤其在超低功耗设备上不切实际。现有压缩技术多需重新训练，成本高且不实用。

Method: 采用分解-剪枝-量化（DPQ-HD）方法，结合三种压缩技术，并引入渐进相似性评分和早退机制以减少计算量。

Result: 在图像和图形分类任务中，内存减少20-100倍，精度仅下降1-2%，且优化时间和推理速度显著优于现有方法（最高100倍和56倍）。

Conclusion: DPQ-HD无需重新训练即可高效压缩超维计算系统，适用于边缘AI设备，性能优于现有技术。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is emerging as a promising approach for edge
AI, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, current
HDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding
matrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant
computational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While
recent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase
the efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them
expensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post
Training Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD),
which aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating
point performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational
and memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression
techniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we
introduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates
similarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce
the computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy.
We demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image
and graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to
uncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing
post-training compression methods and performs better or at par with
retraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less
overall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a
microcontroller

Motivation: 强化学习（RL）具备顺序决策特点，与数据同化的迭代特性天然适配，而传统监督学习无法动态平衡模型预测与观测。

Method: RL-DAUNCE通过三个方面优化：采用类似传统同化的集合成员代理、强调不确定性量化，以及通过对偶优化策略确保物理约束。

Result: 在Madden-Julian Oscillation的应用中，RL-DAUNCE优于标准EnKF，接近约束EnKF的性能，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: RL-DAUNCE不仅提升了数据同化的物理一致性，且在计算效率上显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation.
While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning
(RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework,
which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically
balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new
RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints
through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational
efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to
mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second,
RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble
members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's
ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints
during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state
estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is
developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward
function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process.
Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space.
Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing
efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an
intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian
features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the
violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance
of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing
extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially
less computational effort.

Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting
fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational
irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a
"minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments.
Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability
and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to
unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective
goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external
prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate
this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of
its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central
thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies
undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems
from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment
coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and
relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical
solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This
framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction,
offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI,
and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally
irreducible universe.

### [113] [Dynamic Location Search for Identifying Maximum Weighted Independent Sets in Complex Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04674)
*Enqiang Zhu,Chenkai Hao,Chanjuan Liu,Yongsheng Rao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了一种名为DynLS的新型高效算法，用于解决最大加权独立集（MWIS）问题，该问题可用于智能交通系统（ITS）应用。通过三项创新技术，DynLS在360个测试实例中表现优异，解决了AI在ITS中高计算资源需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和生成式AI在ITS中虽然有效，但需要大量训练时间和计算资源，尤其是在大规模复杂场景中。为了解决这一问题，研究团队提出了DynLS算法。

Method: DynLS结合了三种关键技术：基于分数的自适应顶点扰动（SAVP）、区域定位机制（RLM）动态调整搜索空间，以及结合顶点交换策略和奖励机制的ComLS策略。

Result: 在360个测试实例中，DynLS在350个实例中表现最佳，优于第二名算法Cyclic-Fast177个实例，同时保持了相似的收敛速度。

Conclusion: DynLS是MWIS问题启发式算法的重要进展，为AI优化ITS提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at
generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent
transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant
training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and
complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient
algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem,
which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal
control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our
proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it
effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP)
technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it
includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by
dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable
neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies
with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our
experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently
delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five
leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for
350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177
instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed,
highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a
significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering
a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent
transportation systems.

*Sutapa Dey Tithi,Arun Kumar Ramesh,Clara DiMarco,Xiaoyi Tian,Nazia Alam,Kimia Fazeli,Tiffany Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在符号逻辑证明中的表现，发现DeepSeek-V3在逐步证明构建中准确率达84.4%，但在生成解释性提示时仍需改进以确保教学适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能辅导系统在命题逻辑教学中依赖模板化解释，缺乏个性化反馈，而LLMs虽能动态生成反馈，却可能产生不准确或教学上不合理的解释。本文旨在验证LLMs在逻辑证明中的实际表现。

Method: 比较了四种前沿LLMs的六种提示技术，评估其在358个命题逻辑问题上的逐步准确性，并利用最佳LLM为1,050个学生解题状态生成提示，通过LLM评分和20%样本的人工评估进行检验。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在逐步证明中表现最佳（84.4%准确率），生成的提示在一致性和清晰度上获高分，但在解释上下文和原因上较弱，总体准确率为75%。

Conclusion: LLMs可辅助逻辑辅导系统的提示生成，但需进一步优化以提升准确性和教学适用性。

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching
formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based
explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic
feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically
unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in
constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting
techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic
problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with
84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in
simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory
hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and
evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings
on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate
and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not
perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our
results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with
logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy
and pedagogical appropriateness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动作值表示在强化学习模型中的争议，指出策略梯度模型并非真正“无值”，并推动学术界重新审视标准强化学习的基本假设。

Method: 通过分析策略梯度与基于值的方法的依赖关系，论证动作值在学习和行为中的必要性，并探讨放松标准假设后的潜在影响。

Result: 揭示了策略梯度模型仍需依赖值的表示进行学习，强调需重新评估标准强化学习的底层假设，尤其是在自然场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: 提议将讨论焦点转向模型的基本假设，并提倡在认知科学中对模型复杂性的评估应综合考虑参数统计和计算复杂性。

Abstract: Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL)
models of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented
has been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that
policy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a
potential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is
unsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, "Value-free" --
while they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting
(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching
to PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of
behavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems
from the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by
the standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve
it. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as
part of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the
different methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,
instead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the
underlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from
an experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be
reconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,
full-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are
relaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as
a case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than
statistical, view of what constitutes "a model" in cognitive sciences. Our
analysis suggests that besides "parametric" statistical complexity, additional
aspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when
evaluating model complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ACD主要依赖单智能体RL方法，存在训练成本高、可解释性和可迁移性差的问题。LLM通过提供可解释的动作在安全场景中表现优异，但尚未在多智能体环境下测试。

Method: 提出了一种新的CybORG CAGE 4环境集成方法，并设计了一种通信协议，以评估LLM与RL智能体在多智能体ACD中的协作表现。

Result: 研究揭示了LLM和RL在多智能体ACD中的优劣势，并提出了未来ACD团队创建、训练和部署的研究方向。

Conclusion: LLM在多智能体ACD中表现出潜力，但其与RL的结合仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial
cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response
through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most
ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and
their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language
Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in
general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but
have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD
agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in
multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE
4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by
proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths
and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research
directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.

Motivation: 现有文生图模型因训练数据以欧美文化为主，导致对其他文化（如俄罗斯）的生成结果存在偏见或错误，甚至可能传播冒犯性内容。研究旨在通过文化代码数据集填补这一缺口。

Method: 提出一种针对特定文化（俄罗斯）的数据收集与处理方法，构建文化代码数据集，并利用Kandinsky 3.1模型进行生成质量与文化适应性的实验验证。

Result: 人类评估表明，所提方法显著提升了模型对俄罗斯文化的生成准确性与文化敏感性，减少了刻板印象和错误内容。

Conclusion: 文化代码数据集的引入能有效改善文生图模型在特定文化领域的生成质量，未来可扩展至其他文化以促进多样性。

Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with
international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge
gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large
training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on
Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural
adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the
generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an
effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and
recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image
generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the
research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and
processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in
particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the
quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of
our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation
results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in
the model.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解Transformer-decoder模型在自然语言命令理解和推理能力上的局限性，并设计任务来探测这些边界。

Method: 方法是通过分析模型的潜在变量结构，设计文本谜题库（enigme）来生成评估推理能力的任务。

Result: 结果是开发了enigme这一开源库，用于生成文本谜题以测试和提升模型的推理技能。

Conclusion: 结论是这种方法有助于揭示Transformer-decoder模型的推理能力边界，并为未来AI架构提供评估工具。

Abstract: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based
generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as
general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their
utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the
reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning
process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this
approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the
architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent
variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning
tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present
enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in
training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and
future AI architectures.

Result: 研究表明，这种语言化认知架构能直接支持信念过滤，为AI调控提供结构化方法。

Conclusion: 该机制为嵌入式认知治理开辟了新方向，强调了在AI内部语义空间进行干预的潜力。

Abstract: We examine belief filtering as a mechanism for the epistemic control of
artificial agents, focusing on the regulation of internal cognitive states
represented as linguistic expressions. This mechanism is developed within the
Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured
ensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware
operations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper
illustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a
linguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief
filtering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation. The study
highlights the potential for enhancing AI safety and alignment through
structured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space and points to
new directions for architecturally embedded cognitive governance.

Result: 这种方法有望提高AI系统的弹性和鲁棒性，使其能更好地应对不可预测的现实环境。

Conclusion: 作者认为认知AI是解决当前AI局限性的潜在方案，尤其是提升模型在复杂环境中的表现。

Abstract: Despite the impressive achievements of AI, including advancements in
generative models and large language models, there remains a significant gap in
the ability of AI to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond the training
data. We argue that AI models, especially in autonomous systems, fail to make
robust predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial data, as evidenced
by incidents with autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches
struggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and
domain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards
epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not
only from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which
focuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to
improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can
better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

Abstract: The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences
faces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding
10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review
quality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to
transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback
loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal
accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a
sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be
viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and
system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share
responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only
be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical
concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper
focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through
two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows
authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a
systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask
for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are
needed to enhance the peer review process.

Abstract: The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to
collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society.
Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative
multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the
use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic,
dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation
dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct
interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves
and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for
future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet
effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining
cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can
give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation
of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the
preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.

Motivation: 模拟IC布局需要在设备物理和电路变异性之间进行复杂权衡，传统学习方法难以完全自动化。RL虽有进展，但在灵活性和效率上仍有局限。

Method: 混合方法结合RL和BS策略，BS增强了推理过程，支持多目标加权并处理拥塞问题，无需重新训练策略。

Conclusion: 混合方法不仅保留了RL的泛化能力，还通过BS提升了灵活性和效率，为自动化布局提供了新思路。

Abstract: The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing
device physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with
learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL)
has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the
floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL
with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference
process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating
various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the
need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's
generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of
circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85%
improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a
standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover,
performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing
state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: One of the goals of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is to exploit
background knowledge to improve the performance of learning tasks. However,
most of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where
knowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension.
In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven
sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed
at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental
evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures,
and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results
demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight
under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious

Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the
application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems
are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and
interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and
actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world
feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and
unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL),
reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied
AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications
spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most
research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed
environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex
scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their
surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating
sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative
problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing
research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail
to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent
embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the
advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to
deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges
presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further
development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research,
analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions,
providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.

Method: 提出常数时间失败率模型，假设每分钟任务失败概率恒定，验证其对不同任务时长的适用性。

Result: 模型与数据高度吻合，表明长时任务的失败可能源于子任务集合增大导致的累积失效。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解AI长时任务失败机制提供了新视角，但其普适性需进一步验证。

Abstract: Building on the recent empirical work of Kwa et al. (2025), I show that
within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents
on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical
model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do
the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length
of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life.
This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent
at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the
data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that
they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails
the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is
unknown and an important subject for further work.

### [128] [MARK: Memory Augmented Refinement of Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05177)
*Anish Ganguli,Prabal Deb,Debleena Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 总结了论文的背景、动机、方法和结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型在领域知识更新时的高成本微调问题，论文提出了一个名为MARK的框架，旨在通过结构化细化记忆实现持续学习。

Method: 论文采用了Memory-Augmented Refinement of Knowledge (MARK)框架，通过三个专用代理（如Residual Refined Memory Agent等）来存储、检索和优化领域特定知识。

Result: MARK框架通过减少幻觉、提高领域适应性和优化个性化AI助手，成功提升了语言模型的性能和准确性。

Conclusion: MARK框架提供了一种有效的方法，使得语言模型能够在无需昂贵微调的情况下，持续学习和适应变化的领域知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to
align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain
knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid')
and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory:
Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a
significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced
understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate
information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of
Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without
retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of
Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role:
Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to
maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures
user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension;
LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for
refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory,
detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy.
Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information
while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground
Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference;
Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and
manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets;
Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user
preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为'appropriateness framework'的替代方法，旨在解决AI决策中的伦理多样性问题，强调冲突管理与持续适应的设计原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI伦理对齐方案通常假设道德统一性，忽视了道德多样性可能导致的社会信任危机和制度不稳定，因此需要一种更适应多元伦理的框架。

Method: 基于冲突理论、文化进化、多智能体系统和制度经济学，提出了包含四个原则的appropriateness framework：上下文基础、社区定制、持续适应和多中心治理。

Result: 该框架将伦理对齐的隐喻从道德统一转向冲突管理，更适应现实中的持续分歧，提供了更具适应性和包容性的解决方案。

Conclusion: 作者认为采用这种设计原则不仅是可取的，而且是紧迫的，以适应多元伦理环境并增强社会信任和稳定性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly placed in positions
where their decisions have real consequences, e.g., moderating online spaces,
conducting research, and advising on policy. Ensuring they operate in a safe
and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have
been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems,
which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust,
and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to
an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal
conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a
single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose
what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in
conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional
economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the
normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual
grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4)
polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is
a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a
more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is
both desirable and urgent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为 Abstract DNN-Verification 的新方法，通过分层结构分析 DNN 的安全性，相比传统二元验证方法，提供了更细粒度的安全性评估，且计算效率相当或更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 DNN 形式化验证方法仅能进行二元判断（安全或不安全），无法捕捉模型内部的安全等级差异，导致验证结果可能过于严苛或宽松。

Method: 论文采用抽象解释和输出可达集分析，构建了分层不安全输出的验证框架，支持多级安全性评估，并分析了计算复杂度。

Result: 该方法在 Habitat 3.0 和标准 DNN 验证基准测试中均有效，能够根据抽象安全级别对对抗输入排序，提供更细致的安全性评估。

Conclusion: Abstract DNN-Verification 为 DNN 安全性验证提供了更灵活的框架，理论上兼容现有方法，实践上提升了验证的精确性和效率。

Abstract: Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks
(DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model
is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary
encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often
resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this
paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract
DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs,
providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN.
Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output
reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during
the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less
computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach.
Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial
inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more
detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions
include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel
abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract
interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel
problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep
reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard
DNN-Verification benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于云的移动代理在延迟和成本上的问题，同时避免仅边缘部署时通用能力和复杂任务处理能力的下降。

Method: 提出EcoAgent框架，包含云端规划代理和两个边缘代理（执行代理与观察代理），通过图像压缩和反思模块优化协作。

Result: 在AndroidWorld实验中，EcoAgent显著减少了MLLM的token消耗，同时保持了高任务成功率。

Conclusion: EcoAgent提供了一个高效且实用的移动自动化解决方案，平衡了性能与资源消耗。

Abstract: Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models
((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and
cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general
capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose
EcoAgent, an Edge-Cloud cOllaborative multi-agent framework for mobile
automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based
Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action
execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation
Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise
text, reducing token usage. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves
screen history and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld
show that EcoAgent maintains high task success rates while significantly
reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile
automation.

TL;DR: 探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行业务流程管理的可行性，提出了一种多步骤对话式流程模型重设计（CPD）方法，并通过实验验证其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注单次提示执行，而本工作旨在探索LLMs在持续交互中支持领域专家迭代设计和重设计流程模型的可行性。

Method: 提出CPD方法，通过识别变更模式、重述变更请求并应用变更含义，实现可解释和可重现的流程重设计。

Result: 实验表明，尽管某些模式对LLMs和用户较难理解，LLMs在大多数情况下能良好处理变更需求。

Conclusion: LLMs在业务流程管理中具备潜力，但用户需清晰描述变更请求以获得最佳支持。

Abstract: With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of
AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One
of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally
actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform
crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign.
However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and
evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user
and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to
empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an
iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign
(CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the
user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM
is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b)
re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the
identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of
the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for
explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the
CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be
handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that
some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of
the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes
clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes
well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从时间相关的双变量曲线数据中局部线性近似Fréchet条件均值的问题，尤其是在流形数据中的应用。

Method: 通过外在方法在时变切空间中投影求解，以及内在方法采用加权Fréchet均值计算，并证明了渐近最优性。

Result: 模拟和真实数据（NASA的MAGSAT卫星磁场向量预测）验证了两种预测器的性能和小样本性质。

Conclusion: 外在和内在局部线性Fréchet功能回归预测器均有效，适用于流形数据的功能预测问题。

Abstract: Global Fr\'echet functional regression has been recently addressed from time
correlated bivariate curve data evaluated in a manifold (see Torres et al.
2025). For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem
of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic
and intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an
orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure
the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via
exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted
in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is
also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and
intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve
predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample
size properties are also tested in a real-data application via
cross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector
field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite
NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.

Abstract: Option pricing often requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
Although deep learning-based PDE solvers have recently emerged as quick
solutions to this problem, their empirical and quantitative accuracy remain not
well understood, hindering their real-world applicability. In this research,
our aim is to offer actionable insights into the utility of deep PDE solvers
for practical option pricing implementation. Through comparative experiments in
both the Black--Scholes and the Heston model, we assess the empirical
performance of two neural network algorithms to solve PDEs: the Deep Galerkin
Method and the Time Deep Gradient Flow method (TDGF). We determine their
empirical convergence rates and training time as functions of (i) the number of
sampling stages, (ii) the number of samples, (iii) the number of layers, and
(iv) the number of nodes per layer. For the TDGF, we also consider the order of
the discretization scheme and the number of time steps.

Conclusion: 激活指导剪枝适用于低维环境，而协同进化的高维性增强了随机剪枝的鲁棒性，需结合不同策略优化剪枝效果。

Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using
evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and
decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use
layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of
these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in
more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained
models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and
scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a
population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one
autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators
transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided
pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance
proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where
constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in
randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by
expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform
randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning
according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and
schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决PINNs在重建问题中因物理模型与真实数据不一致而导致的不可解释、不鲁棒和数据不一致的问题。

Method: 提出“显式约束力方法”（ECFM），通过显式控制约束引入的源项来优化重建过程。

Conclusion: ECFM通过满足可解释性、鲁棒性和数据一致性的标准，为复杂物理系统的重建问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution
reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical
system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the
system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression
problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the
parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical
phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming
consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches
may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and
data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of
the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend
strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations,
the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity
and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss
and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data
lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source
terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can
significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially
substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint
enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint
force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the
constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability,
robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and
customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the
parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured
system.

Conclusion: D-CODA为双臂模仿学习提供了一种可扩展的数据增强解决方案，未来可能在更复杂的双臂操作任务中进一步验证其潜力。

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality
and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation
learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing
on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains
costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work
has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these
approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent
observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that
are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated
Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation
tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion
model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both
arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs
constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving
gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual
coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our
results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits
such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop
and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing
frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations,
highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we
introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs)
framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and
decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks
using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including
Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop
performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the
interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance
of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a
strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于AI的视觉反应规划方法，用于提升30克小型无人机在部分已知环境中的自主避障能力，通过分割任务（外部硬件处理深度学习检测，机载执行规划算法）解决了无人机资源限制问题，实现了实时导航。

Abstract: The miniaturisation of sensors and processors, the advancements in connected
edge intelligence, and the exponential interest in Artificial Intelligence are
boosting the affirmation of autonomous nano-size drones in the Internet of
Robotic Things ecosystem. However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and
high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms
is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on
enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform
called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel
AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under
the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal
with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into
two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external
hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show
the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model
performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments
demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top
speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown
position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the
compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the
requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible
alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to
autonomous exploration with nano-drones.

Abstract: Training robots in simulation requires diverse 3D scenes that reflect the
specific challenges of downstream tasks. However, scenes that satisfy strict
task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial
arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate
large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic
environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We
do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts
which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3)
poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using
reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or
inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even
when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables
goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales
across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search
strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and
simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five
diverse environments. Website with videos, code, data, and model weights:

*Taisuke Kobayashi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出CubeDAgger方法，通过改进EnsembleDAgger，增强了交互模仿学习的鲁棒性并减少动态稳定性问题，具体包括激活监督时机阈值、优化动作候选共识系统和引入自回归噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互模仿学习方法通过专家-代理切换系统减少专家负担，但切换时机选择困难且易导致动作突变，损害动态稳定性。因此需要一种新方法在保证鲁棒性的同时减少稳定性问题。

Method: CubeDAgger改进了EnsembleDAgger：1) 显式激活监督时机阈值；2) 将切换系统转变为多动作候选的最优共识系统；3) 引入自回归噪声保证随机探索的时间一致性。

Result: 仿真验证表明，CubeDAgger学习到的策略在交互中既能保持鲁棒性，又能维护动态稳定性。

Conclusion: CubeDAgger通过三项改进有效平衡了交互模仿学习中的鲁棒性与动态稳定性问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Interactive imitation learning makes an agent's control policy robust by
stepwise supervisions from an expert. The recent algorithms mostly employ
expert-agent switching systems to reduce the expert's burden by limitedly
selecting the supervision timing. However, the precise selection is difficult
and such a switching causes abrupt changes in actions, damaging the dynamic
stability. This paper therefore proposes a novel method, so-called CubeDAgger,
which improves robustness while reducing dynamic stability violations by making
three improvements to a baseline method, EnsembleDAgger. The first improvement
adds a regularization to explicitly activate the threshold for deciding the
supervision timing. The second transforms the expert-agent switching system to
an optimal consensus system of multiple action candidates. Third,
autoregressive colored noise to the actions is introduced to make the
stochastic exploration consistent over time. These improvements are verified by
simulations, showing that the learned policies are sufficiently robust while
maintaining dynamic stability during interaction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLAM的连续潜在动作模型，通过利用未标注观察数据和无监督学习潜在动作标签，显著提高了复杂连续控制任务的性能，无需依赖大量标注专家数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模仿学习方法需要大量标注专家数据，成本高昂且难以扩展。论文旨在利用丰富的未标注观察数据（如视频演示）解决这一瓶颈，尤其是在需要精细动作的复杂机器人任务中。

Method: 提出了连续潜在动作模型（CLAM），其核心特点是：（a）使用连续潜在动作标签而非离散表示，（b）联合训练动作解码器，使潜在动作空间能轻松映射到真实动作。该方法仅需少量标注数据（甚至非最优数据）即可学习高性能策略。

Result: 在DMControl（运动控制）和MetaWorld（操作任务）的基准测试中，以及真实的WidowX机械臂上，CLAM显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提高了2-3倍。

Conclusion: CLAM通过无监督学习潜在动作标签和联合训练解码器，成功解决了复杂连续控制任务的数据瓶颈问题，且无需专家标注数据，展现了卓越的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large
amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally
limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this
bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from
video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way.
However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot
tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models
(CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to
solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a)
using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and
(b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space
can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples.
Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data,
enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled
expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl
(locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot
arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods,
remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best
baseline. Videos and code can be found at clamrobot.github.io.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多目标强化学习（MORL）的端到端自动驾驶方法，通过偏好驱动优化实现运行时驾驶风格动态适配，无需重新训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类驾驶员有各自的驾驶风格偏好，现有端到端自动驾驶方法通常依赖预定义风格或需持续用户反馈，无法支持动态、上下文相关的偏好适配。

Method: 使用MORL框架，将偏好编码为连续权重向量，调节可解释的驾驶风格目标（如效率、舒适性、速度和激进性），结合视觉感知处理复杂混合交通场景。

Result: 在CARLA模拟器中验证，单策略智能体能根据变化偏好动态调整驾驶行为，同时保持碰撞避免和路线完成的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效适配用户驾驶风格偏好，提升自动驾驶系统的个性化和适应性。

Abstract: Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style.
Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust
and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on
predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation,
limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We
propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that
enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are
encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable
style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and
aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our
single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic
scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA
simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts
its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining
performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是机器人应像人类一样利用双侧对称性实现双手灵巧操作，但现有方法缺乏有效利用对称性的策略，导致任务效率不足。

Method: 方法是将双手任务分解为单手子任务，利用对称神经网络共享双臂经验，并将其蒸馏为全局策略，以独立于手部任务分配。

Result: 结果表明，在六项模拟任务和两项实际任务中，SYMDEX优于基线方法，尤其在双手分工复杂的任务中表现突出，且能扩展到四臂协作场景。

Conclusion: 结论是通过对称性作为归纳偏置，SYMDEX在样本效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力上均表现出色，适用于多样化的灵巧操作任务。

Abstract: Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation
skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands.
Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit
this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor
a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute
ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce
SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for
ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral
symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation
tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By
exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from
one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the
subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the
hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated
manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of
them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the
left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's
scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our
symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and
coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias
in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization
across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.

systems; and improvement/causality, recognizing situations where strategic
actions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces
a unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including
offline, online, and causal settings, and highlights key challenges such as
differentiating between gaming and improvement and addressing heterogeneity
among agents. By synthesizing findings from diverse works, we outline
theoretical advancements and practical solutions for robust, fair, and

Conclusion: 结论表明，该几何神经网络控制器在矩阵李群系统中具有全局优化和鲁棒性优势，适用于复杂动态环境下的跟踪控制。

Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems
evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and
bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of
matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space
$\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights
that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not
require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie
groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a
global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error
signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free
configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established
using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation
control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.

Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system
operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions.
Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex
dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks
systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper
proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations
(LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective,
LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between
temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control,
while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations
at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated
algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and
objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of
different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python
package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system
optimization models with learnable components. All code and data are available

Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing
mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in
STEM education while favoring software support for this transition by
exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies. What follows is a brief
description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise. The 13th
International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software
(ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy,
France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad
(Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers
was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have
been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in
the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful
representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused
on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible
applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications,
in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the
volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the
development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve
the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and
stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of
the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the

Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法如Neur2SP依赖计算密集型的混合整数规划，限制了可扩展性。本研究旨在通过利用ICNN的线性规划可表示性，开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用输入凸神经网络（ICNN）在凸两阶段随机规划问题中替代混合整数规划，通过LP实现精确推理，无需整数变量。

Conclusion: ICNN增强的两阶段随机规划方法在计算效率和解决方案质量上均优于传统MIP方法，尤其适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling
decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to
the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing
learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP)
employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on
computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We
propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks
(ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP
problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference
through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to
the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of
the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more
computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality.
Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer
training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based
counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits
considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while
preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more
pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the
method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to
MIP-based formulations.

Abstract: Small and medium sized businesses often struggle with data driven decision
making do to a lack of advanced analytics tools, especially in African
countries where they make up a majority of the workforce. Though many tools
exist they are not designed to fit into the ways of working of SMB workers who
are mobile first, have limited time to learn new workflows, and for whom social

created. This intelligent assistant bridges the gap between raw business data,
and actionable insights by leveraging voice interaction and the power of
generative AI. Dukawalla provides an intuitive way for business owners to
interact with their data, aiding in informed decision making. This paper
examines Dukawalla's deployment across SMBs in Nairobi, focusing on their

Abstract: Regression-based predictive analytics used in modern kidney transplantation
is known to inherit biases from training data. This leads to social
discrimination and inefficient organ utilization, particularly in the context
of a few social groups. Despite this concern, there is limited research on
fairness in regression and its impact on organ utilization and placement. This
paper introduces three novel divergence-based group fairness notions: (i)
independence, (ii) separation, and (iii) sufficiency to assess the fairness of
regression-based analytics tools. In addition, fairness preferences are
investigated from crowd feedback, in order to identify a socially accepted
group fairness criterion for evaluating these tools. A total of 85 participants
were recruited from the Prolific crowdsourcing platform, and a Mixed-Logit
discrete choice model was used to model fairness feedback and estimate social
fairness preferences. The findings clearly depict a strong preference towards
the separation and sufficiency fairness notions, and that the predictive
analytics is deemed fair with respect to gender and race groups, but unfair in
terms of age groups.

Abstract: Hypergraphs, capable of representing high-order interactions via hyperedges,
have become a powerful tool for modeling real-world biological and social
systems. Inherent relationships within these real-world systems, such as the
encoding relationship between genes and their protein products, drive the
establishment of interconnections between multiple hypergraphs. Here, we
demonstrate how to utilize those interconnections between multiple hypergraphs
to synthesize integrated information from multiple higher-order systems,
thereby enhancing understanding of underlying structures. We propose a model
based on the stochastic block model, which integrates information from multiple
hypergraphs to reveal latent high-order structures. Real-world hyperedges
exhibit preferential attachment, where certain nodes dominate hyperedge
formation. To characterize this phenomenon, our model introduces hyperedge
internal degree to quantify nodes' contributions to hyperedge formation. This
model is capable of mining communities, predicting missing hyperedges of
arbitrary sizes within hypergraphs, and inferring inter-hypergraph edges
between hypergraphs. We apply our model to high-order datasets to evaluate its
performance. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of our model
in community detection, hyperedge prediction, and inter-hypergraph edge
prediction tasks. Moreover, we show that our model enables analysis of multiple
hypergraphs of different types and supports the analysis of a single hypergraph
in the absence of inter-hypergraph edges. Our work provides a practical and
flexible tool for analyzing multiple hypergraphs, greatly advancing the
understanding of the organization in real-world high-order systems.

Abstract: The medical device industry has significantly advanced by integrating
sophisticated electronics like microchips and field-programmable gate arrays
(FPGAs) to enhance the safety and usability of life-saving devices. These
complex electro-mechanical systems, however, introduce challenging failure
modes that are not easily detectable with conventional methods. Effective fault
detection and mitigation become vital as reliance on such electronics grows.
This paper explores three generative machine learning-based approaches for
fault detection in medical devices, leveraging sensor data from surgical
staplers,a class 2 medical device. Historically considered low-risk, these
devices have recently been linked to an increasing number of injuries and
fatalities. The study evaluates the performance and data requirements of these
machine-learning approaches, highlighting their potential to enhance device

TL;DR: 自动化睡眠分析利用机器学习模型（RobustSleepNet和SUMOv2）实现了睡眠分期和纺锤波检测，成功复制了专家研究中双相情感障碍患者的快纺锤波密度差异，尽管定量结果略有不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化睡眠分析可减少人为误差并支持大规模研究，但目前多步骤分析的可行性尚不明确。

Method: 使用RobustSleepNet进行睡眠分期，SUMOv2检测纺锤波，完全自动化分析双相障碍患者与健康对照的睡眠数据。

Result: 自动化分析在定性上复现了专家研究的关键发现（如快纺锤波密度差异），但定量结果存在差异；模型性能达到或超过人工评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: 全自动化方法可推动大规模睡眠研究，作者公开了分析工具代码并推出了隐私保护平台SomnoBot。

Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)
and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable
large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater
incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle
detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating
multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully
automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep
staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can
replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The
automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based
study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between
bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously
took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis
differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases
between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually
performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle
detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the
potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public
access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and
introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

TL;DR: 利用ChatGPT的零样本学习能力分类应用评论，分为功能需求、非功能需求、两者兼具或无关四类，表现良好但存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法依赖大量领域特定数据集，成本高且耗时，研究探索ChatGPT在零样本学习下的分类潜力。

Method: 在10个应用共1,880条人工标注评论上评估ChatGPT，分析评论可读性、长度对分类的影响，并进行误分类类别手动分析。

Result: ChatGPT分类F1分数达0.842，效果稳健，但可读性和长度等因素影响准确性，部分类别易被误分类。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在无领域数据时仍能有效分类评论，但需注意其局限性和特定场景下的表现。

Abstract: App reviews are a critical source of user feedback, offering valuable
insights into an app's performance, features, usability, and overall user
experience. Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app
development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction.
Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a
pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features
(functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes,
such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements).
Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional
approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large,
domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate.
This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for
classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement,
non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance
on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse
apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves
a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges
and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review
readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual
analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出PR2技术，通过优化C2RUST生成的Rust代码，减少不安全指针的使用，提升内存安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有C2RUST工具生成的Rust代码依赖不安全指针，削弱了Rust的安全性。

Method: 采用局部指针重写技术（PR2），结合决策树提示和代码变更分析，提升指针转换的准确性。

Result: 在28个C项目中，PR2成功消除了13.22%的本地原始指针，平均每个项目耗时5.44小时，成本1.46美元。

Conclusion: PR2显著提升了Rust代码的安全性，为C到Rust的高质量转换提供了可行方案。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's
robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable
syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code.
However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe
constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety
guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs
generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a
peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual
functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs
decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process.
Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors
introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during
compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and
evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show
that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these
projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On
average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an
average cost of $1.46.

Method: 分析了461篇相关论文中的181个基准测试，覆盖SDLC不同阶段。

Result: 基准测试在SDLC中分布不均，60%集中在开发阶段，需求工程和软件设计仅占5%和3%，且Python占主导地位。

Conclusion: 当前研究存在不平衡，未来需缩小理论能力与实际应用的差距。

Abstract: Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in
tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software
engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can
flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking
plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents,
guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing
significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for
CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive
review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing
181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the
software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance
in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the
software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software
design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively.
Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the
reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current
research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the
theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in
real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种兼顾对称性和计算效率的新方法，为点云数据处理提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant
framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the
macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant
models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations
in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by
combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors.
The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding
and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained
architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training
process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning
problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar
function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the
appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions
that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to
implement, and accurate in practical settings.

Result: 发现最优计算机制位于临界阻尼阈值以下，涉及多阶段微观动态放松，且能适应混沌驱动。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解非平衡多体物理中的学习和非常规计算提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the
reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to
infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely
follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime
of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly
optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing
valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more
generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing
are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.
These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference
goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The
regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical
damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple
stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to
a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between
quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and
incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales
of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the
best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the
responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is
interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding
learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body
physics out of equilibrium.

Result: 在3D MRI海马体数据集上，PNN-UNet表现优于基线UNet和其他变体。

Conclusion: PNN-UNet展示了生物启发架构在医学图像分割中的潜力。

Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks
that replicate the planarian neural network (PNN) structure in the context of
3D medical image data. Planarians typically have a cerebral structure
comprising two neural cords, where the cerebrum acts as a coordinator, and the
neural cords serve slightly different purposes within the organism's
neurological system. Accordingly, PNN-UNet comprises a Deep-UNet and a
Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing
the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both
monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D
MRI hippocampus dataset, with and without data augmentation, demonstrate that
PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image
segmentation.

Motivation: 现有的FPM技术重建高分辨率图像计算成本高，特别是在大视场下，因此探索直接在测量阶段分类图像内容以提高效率和减少计算负担。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）直接从FPM测量序列中提取信息分类，并设计了一种学习多路复用的方法来减少数据量。

Result: CNN在分类任务上表现优于传统方法（提升12%），且避免了高计算成本的重建步骤，数据量也显著减少。

Conclusion: 直接在测量阶段进行图像分类的高效方法可行，为医学应用中的快速分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM)
enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an
extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical
applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even
hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide
field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying
the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a
reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can
extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly
outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %)
while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a
high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing
of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy
while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time)
significantly.

Conclusion: 结论是基础模型（如iBOT）可以显著提升AMD识别性能，且自然图像预训练的效果优于领域内预训练。论文还发布了巴西AMD数据集BRAMD（n=587）。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to
learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing
their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models
pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the
benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we
benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets
totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that
iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution
generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of
foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption
that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an
open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Motivation: 知识图谱的复杂模式可能在自然语言转查询任务中引入噪声和增加计算成本，模式过滤通过仅包含相关模式元素来优化这一过程。

Method: 研究比较了不同模式过滤方法在Text2Cypher任务中的效果，分析了其对令牌长度、性能和成本的影响。

Result: 研究表明模式过滤有效优化了Text2Cypher，尤其对较小模型效果显著，且能在降低计算成本方面对大小模型均有帮助。

Conclusion: 尽管大型模型因其长上下文能力受益较少，模式过滤在降低成本方面对所有模型仍具价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent complex data using nodes, relationships, and
properties. Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables
efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models
allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries -
Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts.
However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and
raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by
including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while
reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for
Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and
cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher,
especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that
larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context
capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and
smaller models in cost reduction.

Result: 实验表明，这些硬样本选择方法能够将训练时间和成本降低50%，同时性能几乎不受影响。

Conclusion: 硬样本选择是一种高效且经济的方法，可用于优化LLM在数据库查询任务中的微调过程。

Abstract: Database query languages such as SQL for relational databases and Cypher for
graph databases have been widely adopted. Recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) enable natural language interactions with databases through
models like Text2SQL and Text2Cypher. Fine-tuning these models typically
requires large, diverse datasets containing non-trivial examples. However, as
dataset size increases, the cost of fine-tuning also rises. This makes smaller,
high-quality datasets essential for reducing costs for the same or better
performance. In this paper, we propose five hard-example selection techniques
for pruning the Text2Cypher dataset, aiming to preserve or improve performance
while reducing resource usage. Our results show that these hard-example
selection approaches can halve training time and costs with minimal impact on
performance, and demonstrates that hard-example selection provides a
cost-effective solution.

Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has
enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However,
these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that
extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we
propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously

organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the
technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the
chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection
attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age
range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak,
an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance
Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code
hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our
methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores
guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design
and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk
assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational
systems.

Result: 实验表明，ChainMarks 在相同水印精度下，具有更高的鲁棒性、安全性，并能更可靠地判定水印存在。

Conclusion: ChainMarks 提供了一种高效且安全的 DNN 水印方案，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic
watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of
model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking
schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the
vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the
likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking
scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by
introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a
two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,
ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly
applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated
with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.
Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the
original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted
labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a
more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability
of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher
levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking
schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher
probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level
of watermark accuracy.

Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material
microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical
properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are
computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and
manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that
combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to
efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial
and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain
structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a
novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural
Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural
integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated
that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to
\SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to
approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The
best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of
\SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All
models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size
distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for
applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming,
potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过无监督方式和生成回放提升知识保留能力。

Method: 采用无监督持续学习框架R2R，结合聚类不确定性驱动反馈机制和VLM生成回放模块，动态利用无标注和合成标注数据。

Result: R2R在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100等数据集上分别达到98.13%、73.06%等性能，超越现有方法4.36%。

Conclusion: R2R框架通过生成回放和不确定性驱动机制，有效实现了持续学习的知识保留和迁移，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data
while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating
``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel
uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative
Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture
efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced
proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a
VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods
that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates
without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data
and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled
with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along
with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data
representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that
replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental
analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and
TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention,
achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%,
59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.

Motivation: 现有图像对齐方法在特征稀疏、尺度差异大或变形严重的场景中表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出ART方法，结合自回归框架和多尺度特征，通过迭代采样关键点并利用跨注意力层优化变换场。

Result: 在多样化数据集上，ART显著优于现有技术，展示了更高的对齐精度。

Conclusion: ART为解决复杂图像对齐问题提供了一种高效且通用的新方法。

Abstract: Existing methods for image alignment struggle in cases involving
feature-sparse regions, extreme scale and field-of-view differences, and large
deformations, often resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Robustness to these
challenges improves through iterative refinement of the transformation field
while focusing on critical regions in multi-scale image representations. We
thus propose Auto-Regressive Transformation (ART), a novel method that
iteratively estimates the coarse-to-fine transformations within an
auto-regressive framework. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale features, our
network refines the transformations using randomly sampled points at each
scale. By incorporating guidance from the cross-attention layer, the model
focuses on critical regions, ensuring accurate alignment even in challenging,
feature-limited conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
demonstrate that ART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
establishing it as a powerful new method for precise image alignment with broad
applicability.

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集（仅ImageNet的0.5%大小）上搜索量化策略，实现在ImageNet上同等精度且计算成本显著降低，效率提升高达150%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过小规模数据集搜索量化策略并推广至大规模数据集，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了模型性能，为混合精度量化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for
optimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer.
Existing MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a
computationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale
datasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first
searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them
to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the
need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model
weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques:
sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit
gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different
optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate
optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our
approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\% the size of ImageNet training
data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a
significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to
150% over the baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过利用粗到细的空间信息、语义信息及其交互，并结合特征正交性解耦策略，提高了对新型深度伪造的检测能力。实验结果表明，该方法在跨数据集评估中优于现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的设计选择，显著提升了深度伪造检测的泛化能力和性能，为对抗恶意深度伪造提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remarkable advancements in generative AI technology have given rise to a
spectrum of novel deepfake categories with unprecedented leaps in their
realism, and deepfakes are increasingly becoming a nuisance to law enforcement
authorities and the general public. In particular, we observe alarming levels
of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within
society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are
struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation.
This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which
limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat
the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that
leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their
interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy
of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement
strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature
disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without
adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation.
Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++,
Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design
choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art
methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a
cross-dataset evaluation setting.

Conclusion: SpatialPrompting提供了一种更简单、可扩展的三维空间推理方法，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the
emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language
models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D)
environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific
fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based
features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation
strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity,
Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse
and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them
with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial
relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only
establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes
intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art
zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across
several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for
specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable
alternative to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in
complex, real-world environments.

However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as
captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant
challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we
introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to
evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video
models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene
changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across

legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current
video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at
enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a
foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training
computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of
high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer
that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and
incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal
autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level
discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level
continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize
high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension
and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers
without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results
demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual
tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level
generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in
both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding has become essential with the increase of
text-rich visual content. This field poses significant challenges due to the

particularly across diverse document types with complex layouts. Moreover,
existing fine-tuning datasets for this domain often fall short in providing the
detailed contextual information for robust understanding, leading to
hallucinations and limited comprehension of spatial relationships among visual
elements. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative pipeline that
utilizes adaptive generation of markup languages, such as Markdown, JSON, HTML,
and TiKZ, to build highly structured document representations and deliver
contextually-grounded responses. We introduce two fine-grained structured
datasets: DocMark-Pile, comprising approximately 3.8M pretraining data pairs
for document parsing, and DocMark-Instruct, featuring 624k fine-tuning data
annotations for grounded instruction following. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-theart MLLMs across a range of visual document understanding
benchmarks, facilitating advanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities in
complex visual scenarios. Our code and models are released at https://github.

TL;DR: StabStitch++ 是一个新的视频拼接框架，解决了‘warping shake’问题，通过虚拟中间面设计和双向分解模块，实现了空间拼接和时间稳定的无监督学习，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频拼接方法在从图像扩展到视频时，会因为时间上的不稳定而导致‘warping shake’，尽管输入视频稳定，拼接视频仍会出现不必要的抖动。

Method: 提出StabStitch++框架，采用虚拟中间面设计，通过双向分解模块均匀分配对齐负担和投影变形，并结合时间和空间变换模型生成稳定拼接视频。

Result: 实验表明StabStitch++在拼接性能、鲁棒性和效率上超越现有方案，实现了实时在线视频拼接系统。

Conclusion: StabStitch++ 在不牺牲对齐和稳定的情况下，显著提升了视频拼接的整体质量。

Abstract: We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which
unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when
extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are
stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and
affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a
novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal
stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from
existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image
to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image
planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable
bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation
and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens
and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in
video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching
trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal
warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched
videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment,
trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that
sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and
optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To
establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a
video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes.
Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching
performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in
this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.

TL;DR: 该论文研究六种姿态跟踪器在短跑生物力学分析中的表现，提出后处理模块以提高准确性，结果显示基于关节的模型误差较小但仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，姿态估计技术的进步使其在体育分析中展现出潜力。研究旨在评估不同姿态跟踪器在短跑生物力学分析中的表现，并提出优化方案以提高准确性。

Method: 研究比较了六种跟踪器（两种基于点，四种基于关节）的性能，并与专家手动标注的5870帧数据进行对比。实验对五名职业短跑运动员的40次短跑进行关键角度分析（躯干倾斜、髋关节屈伸、膝关节屈伸），并开发了一个后处理模块用于异常值检测和融合预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于关节的模型均方根误差在11.41°至4.37°之间，加入后处理模块后可降至6.99°至3.88°，显示出姿态跟踪在生物力学分析中的实用性，但高精度应用仍需改进。

Conclusion: 姿态跟踪方法对短跑生物力学分析具有价值，但需进一步优化以满足高精度需求。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years,
mainly due to the integration of deep learning models, the availability of a
vast amount of data, and large computational resources. These developments have
led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in
sports analysis and performance evaluation.
  This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and
four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed
framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the
manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The
experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners,
focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip
flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module
for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles.
  The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields
root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When
integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to
6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that
human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical
analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in
applications where high accuracy is required.

Abstract: We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout
generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods
are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for
open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader
applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use
lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text
prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in
an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning
benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we
show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly
combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a
pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn
in image editing applications.

Motivation: CLIP虽然在多模态任务中表现优秀，但在细粒度理解方面存在不足，主要因为其依赖粗粒度的短标题。FG-CLIP旨在通过改进数据和方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过三种关键创新：1) 利用大模型生成长标题-图像对；2) 构建包含区域标注的高质量数据集；3) 引入困难负样本以优化模型区分能力。

Result: FG-CLIP在细粒度理解、开放词汇目标检测等任务中优于原始CLIP和其他先进方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks
such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with
fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions.
To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances
fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage
large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for
capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is
constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding
boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich
representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are
incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic
differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these
data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original
CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks,
including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection,
image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results
highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and
improving overall model performance. The related data, code, and models are

Motivation: 当前的提示学习方法主要关注文本提示，而忽略了生物医学图像中的特殊结构（如复杂的解剖结构和细微的病理特征）。

Method: Biomed-DPT设计了双模态提示：1) 文本提示结合模板驱动的临床提示和LLM驱动的领域适应提示；2) 视觉提示引入零向量作为软提示，通过注意力重加权避免关注非诊断区域和非关键病理特征。

Result: Biomed-DPT在11个生物医学图像数据集上平均分类准确率达到66.14%，在基础类和新类中分别达到78.06%和75.97%，优于CoOp方法6.20%、3.78%和8.04%。

Conclusion: Biomed-DPT通过双模态提示和知识增强，显著提升了生物医学图像分类的准确性，尤其在少样本场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image
classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt
learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular
structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological
features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a
knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text
prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven
clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted
prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts
through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt,
Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention
re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of
non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average
classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering
9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes
and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method
by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively. Our code are available at

Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D
Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual
prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is
to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared
with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding,
this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple
valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and
free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation
protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as
well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that
this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of
benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

Abstract: Thoracolumbar stump ribs are one of the essential indicators of thoracolumbar
transitional vertebrae or enumeration anomalies. While some studies manually
assess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to
automate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology
quantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for
rib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models
(Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative
algorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs,
showing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show
that stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs
-13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1,
p-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first
centimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially
visible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating
stump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public
use.

Abstract: Accurate building segmentation from high-resolution RGB imagery remains
challenging due to spectral similarity with non-building features, shadows, and
irregular building geometries. In this study, we present a comprehensive deep
learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and
satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate
a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by
deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index
(MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a
Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively.
We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical
learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource
usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall
accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.80, outperforming existing RGB-based benchmarks. This study demonstrates the
effectiveness of combining multi-resolution imagery, feature augmentation, and

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has surpassed human performance on standard benchmarks,
driving its widespread adoption in computer vision tasks. One such task is
disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in
stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like
medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity
estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and
adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and
generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating
the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering
progress in the field.
  To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking
tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation
methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions
such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common
Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We
conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity
estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy,
reliability, and generalization. Open-source code for DispBench:

Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips,
provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios.
However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has
become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a
promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data
distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.
Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional
artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this
gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time
adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution
shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which
dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired
normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in
improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining
low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for
online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of
future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at

TL;DR: GroVE proposes a post-hoc method to generate probabilistic embeddings from frozen VLMs using GPLVM, improving uncertainty calibration in vision-language tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VLMs struggle with capturing uncertainties in visual and textual ambiguities, and existing probabilistic approaches require large datasets and retraining.

Method: GroVE uses GPLVM to learn a shared latent space from frozen VLMs, optimizing for single-modal reconstruction and cross-modal alignment to generate uncertainty-aware embeddings.

Result: GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty calibration in tasks like cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and active learning.

Conclusion: GroVE effectively enhances frozen VLMs with probabilistic embeddings without retraining, addressing uncertainty in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn joint representations by mapping images
and text into a shared latent space. However, recent research highlights that
deterministic embeddings from standard VLMs often struggle to capture the
uncertainties arising from the ambiguities in visual and textual descriptions
and the multiple possible correspondences between images and texts. Existing
approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM
training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful
representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper,
we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings
from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
(GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text
inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal
embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Once trained,
the Gaussian Process model generates uncertainty-aware probabilistic
embeddings. Evaluation shows that GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty
calibration across multiple downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval,
visual question answering, and active learning.

Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车在紧急车辆灯光照射下可能无法检测物体，存在安全隐患。

Method: 评估多种ADAS和物体检测器，测试不同灯光模式，并提出Caracetamol框架。

Result: Caracetamol将YOLOv3和Faster RCNN的车辆检测置信度提高了0.20，波动范围减少0.33。

Conclusion: Caracetamol能有效提升自动驾驶在紧急灯光下的检测稳定性，满足实时性需求。

Abstract: The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years,
especially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot
engaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and
firetrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources
often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image
quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear.
In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object
detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when
exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a
significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect
objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be
exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving
assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,
"manufacturer C", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors
(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle
lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental
factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their
performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To
mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to
enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated
emergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster
RCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by
0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by
0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of
between 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过强化学习提升流匹配模型的性能，尤其是在复杂任务中提高生成准确性和效率。

Method: 采用ODE-to-SDE转换和降噪策略，前者实现统计采样以支持RL探索，后者减少训练步骤但不影响推理性能。

Result: 在文本到图像任务中显著提升性能，如GenEval准确性从63%提升至95%，视觉文本渲染从59%提升至92%，且未牺牲图像质量或多样性。

Conclusion: Flow-GRPO不仅高效提升了生成任务的准确性，还保持了图像质量与多样性，展示了强化学习在流匹配模型中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement
learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies:
(1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation
(SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps,
enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction
strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original
inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without
performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple
text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly
perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting
GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy
improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation.
Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.
Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase
at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our

several dialects are investigated in this work. Because of its great phonetic
and lexical differences, Kurdish with several dialects including Kurmanji,
Sorani, and Hawrami offers special challenges for speaker recognition systems.
The main difficulties in building a strong speaker identification system

dialect together with cross-dialect training greatly enhance recognition
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的量子启发式数据填补框架，结合PCA和量子辅助旋转，在UCI糖尿病数据集上显著提升了填补效果，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据预处理中缺失值或不可靠值的问题，尤其在医疗等关键领域，需要高保真度的填补方法。

Method: 集成PCA与量子辅助旋转，通过无梯度优化器（COBYLA、模拟退火、差分进化）优化填补缺失值，并约束填补值在±2标准差内。

Result: 填补效果显著提升，Wasserstein距离平均减少85%以上，Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验p值更优（0.18-0.22 vs 传统方法>0.99）。

Conclusion: 该方法结合量子启发式变换与可扩展的经典框架，为医疗和AI等领域提供了高质量的填补方案。

Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for
datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel
quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset,
which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical
features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with
quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical
optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to
reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed
values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature
distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This
approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement,
including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values >
0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also
eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of
imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable
classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation
tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and
integrity are crucial.

Conclusion: GroverGPT-2为机器理解量子算法和建模量子电路逻辑提供了原型，为量子教育和研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for
specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open
question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether,
and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent
progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning
abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In
this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating
Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native
tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation
directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically
structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can
learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of
quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like
LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2
outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit
reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a
prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and
modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for
GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable
classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the
limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research,
and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.

Conclusion: 该研究为生成模型建立了新的理论范式，展示了量子联合分布学习的优势。

Abstract: This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome
classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously
prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension
transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit
worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data
dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through
diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving
posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of
posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the
joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for
quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit
using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable
classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution
learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise,
eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate
the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions
compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new
theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage
in joint distribution learning.

Result: 在非对数凹情况下，该算法首次实现了相对于经典方法的量子优势，并为复杂能量景观的采样提供了更快的量子加速。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子计算在非凸优化和采样领域的应用提供了理论基础和实用工具，展示了量子加速在实际问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta
V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics,
chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is
non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical
methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce
the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of
continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes
the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as
the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten
Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value
thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to
the Poincar\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this
framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates
replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from
complex, rugged energy landscapes.

<details>

Motivation: 生成式推荐系统在提供更丰富用户体验的同时，也带来了新的风险，如幻觉项目、偏见放大或隐私泄露。传统准确性指标无法全面衡量这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一种整体评估方法，包括场景化评估和多指标检查，涵盖相关性、事实基础、偏见检测和政策合规性。

Result: 通过分类和评估方法，为研究人员和实践者提供了一个全面评估Gen-RecSys的框架，以实现有效个性化和负责任部署。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成式推荐系统的评估提供了系统化的指导，帮助在技术发展的同时确保内容安全和用户意图对齐。

Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond
classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously
unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these
systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and
multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown
territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private
information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these
challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or
alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation
challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are
exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new
risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we
propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments
and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias
detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so
researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring
effective personalization and responsible deployment.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了QBD-RankedDatagen，一种生成定制化查询文档匹配（QBD）数据集的方法，并比较了多种基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法，旨在降低领域专家在数据集创建中的工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QBD检索方法依赖领域特定数据集，但创建这些数据集成本高且耗时。本文旨在通过自动化方法减少人工干预，同时保持足够的专家知识以优化检索模型。

Method: 提出QBD-RankedDatagen流程，利用LLM生成文档评分和排名，并结合专家输入。在TREC的QBD数据集上评估，并优化BM25模型参数。

Result: 该方法显著减少了数据集创建的人力成本，同时生成的排名和评分足够用于检索模型调优。BM25模型在生成数据上表现良好。

Conclusion: QBD-RankedDatagen是一种高效且低成本的方法，适用于需要定制化QBD搜索的领域，如专利、法律或学术文献。

Abstract: The Query-By-Document (QBD) problem is an information retrieval problem where
the query is a document, and the retrieved candidates are documents that match
the query document, often in a domain or query specific manner. This can be
crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval,
and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword
search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets
to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific
datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to
generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in
this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative
analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human
interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large
Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce
document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The
process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human
effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient
expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD
datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters
of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines
like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of scientific literature leads to underutilized knowledge and duplicated efforts. HiPerRAG aims to improve LLM factuality and cross-disciplinary collaboration by efficiently processing vast amounts of scientific content.

Method: HiPerRAG combines Oreo (a high-throughput multimodal document parser) and ColTrast (a query-aware encoder fine-tuned with contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques), leveraging HPC to scale to millions of documents.

Result: HiPerRAG achieves 90% accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA, outperforming domain-specific models like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. It scales effectively on supercomputers like Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier.

Conclusion: HiPerRAG demonstrates robust performance and scalability, unifying scientific knowledge and enabling interdisciplinary innovation through efficient RAG workflows.

Abstract: The volume of scientific literature is growing exponentially, leading to
underutilized discoveries, duplicated efforts, and limited cross-disciplinary
collaboration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist
scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions
of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational
costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as
well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the
nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce
HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index
and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its
core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and
ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval
accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques.
HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering
benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90%
accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models
like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs
on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million
document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering
interdisciplinary innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于法律知识的专业性和普通用户缺乏相关知识背景，传统的法律知识检索方法难以满足用户需求。论文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了QBR方法，利用问题库（QB）作为中介，通过生成训练样本来增强文档中知识单元的嵌入，从而实现细粒度的知识检索。

Result: 实验显示，QBR在准确性、效率和可解释性上优于传统方法，且能帮助普通用户更好地理解检索结果并解决日常法律问题。

Conclusion: QBR不仅提升了法律知识检索的效率和质量，还具有显著的社会影响，帮助普通用户解决实际问题。

Abstract: Retrieval of legal knowledge by the general public is a challenging problem
due to the technicality of the professional knowledge and the lack of
fundamental understanding by laypersons on the subject. Traditional information
retrieval techniques assume that users are capable of formulating succinct and
precise queries for effective document retrieval. In practice, however, the
wide gap between the highly technical contents and untrained users makes legal
knowledge retrieval very difficult. We propose a methodology, called QBR, which
employs a Questions Bank (QB) as an effective medium for bridging the knowledge
gap. We show how the QB is used to derive training samples to enhance the
embedding of knowledge units within documents, which leads to effective
fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We discuss and evaluate through experiments
various advantages of QBR over traditional methods. These include more
accurate, efficient, and explainable document retrieval, better comprehension
of retrieval results, and highly effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We
also present some case studies and show that QBR achieves social impact by
assisting citizens to resolve everyday legal concerns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个结合传统推荐模型和大型语言模型（LLM）的混合框架，用于重新排序推荐系统中的前k项，旨在解决LLM在推荐任务中的上下文限制和位置偏差问题。实验表明，尽管随机化用户历史提高了排序质量，LLM重新排序并未超越基础模型，且减少位置偏差的显式指令效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在数字平台中扮演重要角色，但LLM在推荐任务中面临上下文窗口限制、效率低的点对和成对提示以及处理列表排序困难的挑战。此外，LLM对位置偏差敏感，可能过度强调提示中的早期项。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了一种混合框架。

Method: 作者开发了一个结合传统推荐模型和LLM的混合框架，利用结构化提示对前k项进行重新排序，同时评估用户历史重新排序和指令提示对缓解位置偏差的影响。通过在MovieLens-100K数据集上的实验验证方法的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，随机化用户历史提高了排序质量，但LLM重新排序未超越基础模型。显式指令减少位置偏差的效果不佳，揭示了LLM在建模排序上下文和减少偏差方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文展示了LLM在推荐系统中的实际局限性，特别是在处理排序上下文和位置偏差方面的挑战，为未来研究提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across
digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to
their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training.
However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window
size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling
listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to
position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless
of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM
for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of
user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias.
Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves
ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model.
Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our
evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and
mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.

Conclusion: ChannelExplorer为分析深度神经网络的激活通道和类别可分性提供了直观且有效的方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in many
vision tasks, yet understanding their internal behavior remains challenging,
particularly how different layers and activation channels contribute to class
separability. We introduce ChannelExplorer, an interactive visual analytics
tool for analyzing image-based outputs across model layers, emphasizing
data-driven insights over architecture analysis for exploring class
separability. ChannelExplorer summarizes activations across layers and
visualizes them using three primary coordinated views: a Scatterplot View to
reveal inter- and intra-class confusion, a Jaccard Similarity View to quantify
activation overlap, and a Heatmap View to inspect activation channel patterns.
Our technique supports diverse model architectures, including CNNs, GANs,
ResNet and Stable Diffusion models. We demonstrate the capabilities of
ChannelExplorer through four use-case scenarios: (1) generating class hierarchy
in ImageNet, (2) finding mislabeled images, (3) identifying activation channel
contributions, and(4) locating latent states' position in Stable Diffusion
model. Finally, we evaluate the tool with expert users.

Conclusion: 该技术广泛适用于多目标优化问题，无需手动调整，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous
optimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications.
Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned
aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance
of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a
time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the
setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically
simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically
used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain
expertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability
of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we
present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is
broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems,
including motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator
receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the
optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters
to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving
comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying
on manually tuned reward functions. Results are best visualized through

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景重建中实现了高精度和高效性，为单视角C-ToF数据优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular
continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that
achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is
100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a
single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF
radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly
measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and
underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based
scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with
multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its
optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to
improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental
results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under
constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging
baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工神经网络（ANNs）取得显著进展，但其基础学习机制中的‘虚构’现象仍未被充分理解。论文旨在通过研究储备池计算机（RCs）中明确存在的虚构行为（表现为未训练吸引子UAs），为这一现象提供理论依据。

Method: 以储备池计算机（RCs）为模型，分析其在动力学吸引子重建过程中产生未训练吸引子（UAs）的行为，并探讨UAs如何导致重建失败及影响模型中的吸引子转换。

Result: 研究发现，UAs是状态空间受限的学习系统中的固有特征；它不仅存在于RCs中，也可能广泛存在于其他系统中，从而解释了虚构现象的普遍性。

Conclusion: 论文证实了UAs作为虚构现象的核心机制，并指出其在更广泛系统中的潜在存在，为未来研究类似问题提供了理论基础和方法启示。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to
innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how
elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information
without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To
provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation
occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN.
RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a
well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given
attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to
construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on
the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when
modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results,
we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state
spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in
systems beyond RCs.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效恢复算子的谱特性，并展示了学习基函数的动态适应性。

Conclusion: 通过学习的基函数可以有效近似线性算子，为复杂动力系统的分析和预测提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing
complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling for a
deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectrum of these
operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent
behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging.
We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational
learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient
finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal,
locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system.
This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the
operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We
illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral
properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive
quality of the machine-learned basis.

Abstract: Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in
various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of
the generalization behavior of CRL is limited. Moreover, to the best of our
knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the
assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently
and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a
fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle
data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the
tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In
this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under
non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing
inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization
bounds which indicate the required number of samples in each class scales as
the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature
representations associated to each class. Next, we apply our main results to
derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and
neural networks.

Abstract: The identification of a linear system model from data has wide applications
in control theory. The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for
linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system
trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics
is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a
linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that
there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the
experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data
acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and
provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our
error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and
demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error
due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we
also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a
single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful tool for constructing prediction intervals
for black-box models, providing a finite sample coverage guarantee for
exchangeable data. However, this exchangeability is compromised when some
entries of the test feature are contaminated, such as in the case of cellwise
outliers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework called
detect-then-impute conformal prediction. This framework first employs an
outlier detection procedure on the test feature and then utilizes an imputation
method to fill in those cells identified as outliers. To quantify the
uncertainty in the processed test feature, we adaptively apply the detection
and imputation procedures to the calibration set, thereby constructing
exchangeable features for the conformal prediction interval of the test label.
We develop two practical algorithms, PDI-CP and JDI-CP, and provide a
distribution-free coverage analysis under some commonly used detection and
imputation procedures. Notably, JDI-CP achieves a finite sample $1-2\alpha$
coverage guarantee. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit robust coverage properties and
comparable efficiency to the oracle baseline.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, raises
a key question: how can synthetic data from these models enhance predictive
modeling? While they can generate vast amounts of datasets, only a subset
meaningfully improves performance. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that
generates and systematically filters synthetic data through domain-specific
statistical methods, selectively integrating high-quality samples for effective
augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive
performance across various settings, highlighting the potential of our
framework while underscoring the inherent limitations of generative models for
data augmentation. Despite the ability to produce large volumes of synthetic
data, the proportion that effectively improves model performance is limited.

Abstract: The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on
observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test
for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is
whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical
across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text
similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated
using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from
an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated
using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We
showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic
asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting
strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a
unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example
demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type
one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The
proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document
classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is
crucial.

Conclusion: 联合理想分布与统计差异阈值结合的方法为拒绝学习提供了新的视角，且Bhattacharyya差异的适用性更强。

Abstract: Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to
abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an
ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a
hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal
distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint
ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between
rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find
that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by
considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the
skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in
contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical
characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a
thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that
rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.

Abstract: Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder that doubles the
lifetime risk of cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, this relationship remains
poorly characterized, and few clinical guidelines exist to reduce this
associated risk. We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract
probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data
and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These
sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph
constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our
population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these
sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most
predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that
pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS
risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as
a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients.

Abstract: The moments of random variables are fundamental statistical measures for
characterizing the shape of a probability distribution, encompassing metrics
such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, the product
moments, including covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between
multiple random variables. On the other hand, the primary focus of causal
inference is the evaluation of causal effects, which are defined as the
difference between two potential outcomes. While traditional causal effect
assessment focuses on the average causal effect, this work provides
definitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product
moments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We
conduct experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal
effects from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a
real-world medical dataset.

Abstract: Mediation analysis for probabilities of causation (PoC) provides a
fundamental framework for evaluating the necessity and sufficiency of treatment
in provoking an event through different causal pathways. One of the primary
objectives of causal mediation analysis is to decompose the total effect into
path-specific components. In this study, we investigate the path-specific
probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into
path-specific components along distinct causal pathways between treatment and
outcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the path-specific PNS for
decomposition and provide an identification theorem. Furthermore, we conduct
numerical experiments to assess the properties of the proposed estimators from
finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world
educational dataset.
