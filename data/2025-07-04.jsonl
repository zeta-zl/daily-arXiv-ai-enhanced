Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these\nAI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and\nimportant topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within\nmachine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to\nresample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates\nvary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the\ntraining set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and\nseemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using\ndata obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label\nbias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and\nmedicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,\nemails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,\ndoctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support\nrigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data\nfrom audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and\nevaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases\nwhere the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across\nclasses appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has\nroughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately.

As a\nbaseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained\nfrom scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While\neffective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment\n(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a\ndrift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of\ndrifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number\nof up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new\ndistribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while\nreducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.\n  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants\nof standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and\nTiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several\nrehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,\nmaintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as\na scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary\ncontinual learning environments."}

GRPO-style approaches implement\nthis by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.\nHowever, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce\npositive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows\n(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems\nwhere it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in\nearly-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive\nsamples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a\nnatural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.\nInstead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they\nshould (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's\nlikelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we\npropose $\\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and\nmodular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the\nground-truth answer.

Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition\nAdaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and\nReinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget\nconstraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.\nFurthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment\ntailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation\nand benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising\nreal-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse\nmarket conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for\nride-hailing service providers."}

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD\ndataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly\ntasks."}

We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus\nmainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic\nelements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise\nspeaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address\nthese gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm\npatterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker\nidentity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We\npublicly release our code."}

These tasks are traditionally executed with a\nlinear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their\nlocation, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of\nwhich, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario\n(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).\nHowever, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,\nwhile making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to\nerrors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and\ncomputational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop\ntechniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives\nrise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a\nsmall computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,\nhearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this\neffect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where\nthe tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate\nfor local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to\ncorrect the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the\nlocalization's sensitivity towards interferences.

In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the\nnon-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based\nuniversity. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that\ncould be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning\nalgorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction\naccuracy.

We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small\nones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator\nagreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using\nLLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.\nImproving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:\nthe rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their\nfree-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we\ndiscuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer\nmatching."}

Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies\nan image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods\nmaintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more\nimages. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer\nfrom information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online\nframework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we\nmaintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D\nstructure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a\nspecific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global\ncoordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We\ndesign a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and\ndesign a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer\nmemory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or\nstate-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/YkiWu/Point3R."}
