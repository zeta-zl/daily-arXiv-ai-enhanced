Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages.

ETT enable the extension of the\ncontext length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on\nthe input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT\non LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32\ntimes, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens.

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information.

Although current instruction\ndatasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may\nstill struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.\nThis is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of\ntask types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the\ninstruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction\ndata construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,\nan informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis\nprocess, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These\ncomponents form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage\nand depth of instruction data.

The dynamics\nthat are formed in these models exhibit features such as neural collapse and\nemergence of latent representations that may support the remarkable\ngeneralization properties of networks. In neuroscience, qualitative features of\nthese representations are used to compare learning in biological and artificial\nsystems. Despite recent progress, there remains a need for theoretical tools to\nrigorously understand the mechanisms shaping learned representations,\nespecially in finite, non-linear models. Here, we show that the gradient flow,\nwhich describes how the model's dynamics evolve over GD, can be decomposed into\na product that involves two operators: a Parameter Operator, K, and a\nLinearized Flow Propagator, P. K mirrors the Neural Tangent Kernel in\nfeed-forward neural networks, while P appears in Lyapunov stability and optimal\ncontrol theory. We demonstrate two applications of our decomposition. First, we\nshow how their interplay gives rise to low-dimensional latent dynamics under\nGD, and, specifically, how the collapse is a result of the network structure,\nover and above the nature of the underlying task.

However, a limitation is that a\npronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech\nrecognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation\nlexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being\ntreated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a\nspeech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a\ngrapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.\nTo jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic\napproximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM\n(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance\nparticularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the\nWhistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are\nconducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of\nphoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\\% error rate\nreductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword\nor full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain\nadaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms\nthe standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the\nG2P model by 9% error rate reductions.

(2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code\nbecome emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad\nsettings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains\nunclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.\n  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form\nquestions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly\nimpacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and\nfree-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour\nfrom insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking\nthem to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the\nfactual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to\nchange their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all\ncases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to\nprompt nudges.\n  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned\nresponses to seemingly neutral prompts.

Under review", "summary": "Reducing energy consumption has become a pressing need for modern machine\nlearning, which has achieved many of its most impressive results by scaling to\nlarger and more energy-consumptive neural networks. Unfortunately, the main\nalgorithm for training such networks, backpropagation, poses significant\nchallenges for custom hardware accelerators, due to both its serial\ndependencies and the memory footprint needed to store forward activations for\nthe backward pass. Alternatives to backprop, although less effective, do exist;\nhere the main computational bottleneck becomes matrix multiplication. In this\nstudy, we derive forward-forward algorithms for binary, stochastic units.\nBinarization of the activations transforms matrix multiplications into indexing\noperations, which can be executed efficiently in hardware. Stochasticity,\ncombined with tied weights across units with different biases, bypasses the\ninformation bottleneck imposed by binary units. Furthermore, although slow and\nexpensive in traditional hardware, binary sampling that is very fast can be\nimplemented cheaply with p-bits (probabilistic bits), novel devices made up of\nunstable magnets.

To enhance the advantage of Adam and\nmitigate its limitation, we propose SignSoftSGD (S3), a novel optimizer with\nthree key innovations. \\emph{First}, S3 generalizes the sign-like update by\nemploying a flexible $p$-th order momentum ($p \\geq 1$) in the denominator,\ndeparting from the conventional second-order momentum (variance)\npreconditioning. This design enables enhanced performance while achieving\nstable training even with aggressive learning rates. \\emph{Second}, S3\nminimizes the occurrences of loss spikes through unified exponential moving\naverage coefficients for numerator and denominator momenta, which inherently\nbound updates to $[-1, 1]$ and simplify hyperparameter tuning. \\emph{Third}, S3\nincorporates an equivalent Nesterov's accelerated gradient(NAG) module,\naccelerating convergence without memory overhead.

Existing attacks typically target the entire user group, which\ncompromises stealth and increases the risk of detection. In contrast,\nreal-world adversaries may prefer to prompt target items to specific user\nsubgroups, such as recommending health supplements to elderly users. Motivated\nby this gap, we introduce Spattack, the first targeted poisoning attack\ndesigned to manipulate recommendations for specific user subgroups in the\nfederated setting. Specifically, Spattack adopts a two-stage\napproximation-and-promotion strategy, which first simulates user embeddings of\ntarget/non-target subgroups and then prompts target items to the target\nsubgroups. To enhance the approximation stage, we push the inter-group\nembeddings away based on contrastive learning and augment the target group's\nrelevant item set based on clustering. To enhance the promotion stage, we\nfurther propose to adaptively tune the optimization weights between target and\nnon-target subgroups. Besides, an embedding alignment strategy is proposed to\nalign the embeddings between the target items and the relevant items. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets, comparing\nSpattack against seven state-of-the-art poisoning attacks and seven\nrepresentative defense mechanisms.

Self-play (SP) algorithms try to\nharness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,\nthereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.\nHowever, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in\nlocally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a\nnew direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast\nknowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping\nacross local optima in policy space.

We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a\ncontinuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety\nsimulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car\nTag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and\nheuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy\nquality, \\ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In\nGandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through\nand jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.\nFurthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered\nvulnerabilities.

A common approach for calibration is\nfitting a post-hoc calibration map on unseen validation data that transforms\npredicted probabilities.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of\noutput token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are\nlargely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference\ndynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to\nanalyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens\nacross 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with\nhigher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain\nand uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at\nsimilar layers.

Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric\nintegration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce\nBayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in\nneural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications\nwith 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through\nforests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface\ngeometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF\nor 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define\ncontinuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical\nmodeling and analysis.

This strategy is\nimplemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language\ndiagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,\nattributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nstrategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to\nimprove intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such\nas: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and\nkey relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram\ngeneration. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is\nillustrated with different case studies.

While prior work\nhas emphasized algorithmic design, data curation, and reward shaping, we\ninvestigate RLVR from a sample-centric perspective and introduce LPPO\n(Learning-Progress and Prefix-guided Optimization), a framework of progressive\noptimization techniques. Our work addresses a critical question: how to best\nleverage a small set of trusted, high-quality demonstrations, rather than\nsimply scaling up data volume. First, motivated by how hints aid human\nproblem-solving, we propose prefix-guided sampling, an online data augmentation\nmethod that incorporates partial solution prefixes from expert demonstrations\nto guide the policy, particularly for challenging instances.

To address the need for adaptable\nand noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained\nlarge language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective\nsentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no\nfinetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining\nsupervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)\nclassifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance\ndespite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE\nevaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),\nmeasuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,\nand Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also\nrelease Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where\nonly KG-derived annotations are available.

Such abilities can enhance the realism of\nmodels. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the\nepistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,\nare too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be\nconsistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically\ndemanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that\nconverts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core\ndilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and\nabstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding\nundermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like\ninstructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the\ntension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the\nchallenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become\nobscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents\ntowards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social\nmechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.\nThis exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,\nrather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the\nconditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence\nis not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions\nunfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than\nlong-term behavioural evolution.

As these\nsystems evolve rapidly, it becomes increasingly important to reliably predict\ntheir states in the short term to ensure operational stability, support control\ndecisions, and enable interpretable monitoring of sensor and machine behavior.\nModern power systems often span multiple physical domains - including\nelectrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal - posing significant challenges\nfor modeling and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a\npromising data-driven framework for system state estimation and state\nforecasting in such settings. By leveraging the topological structure of sensor\nnetworks, GNNs can implicitly learn inter-sensor relationships and propagate\ninformation across the network. However, most existing GNN-based methods are\ndesigned under the assumption of homogeneous sensor relationships and are\ntypically constrained to a single physical domain. This limitation restricts\ntheir ability to integrate and reason over heterogeneous sensor data commonly\nencountered in real-world energy systems, such as those used in energy\nconversion infrastructure.

Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process\nthat gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,\nfollowed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful\nin continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly\nnatural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and\nthe lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility\nand performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To\nassess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative\nLog-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.\n  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a\nmean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of\n4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches\nper sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were\nconducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with\na fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison.

Recently, several studies\nhighlighted the impact of the geometry of training trajectories on the\ngeneralization error, both theoretically and empirically. Among these works, a\nseries of topological generalization bounds have been proposed, relating the\ngeneralization error to notions of topological complexity that stem from\ntopological data analysis (TDA). Despite their empirical success, these bounds\nrely on intricate information-theoretic (IT) terms that can be bounded in\nspecific cases but remain intractable for practical algorithms (such as ADAM),\npotentially reducing the relevance of the derived bounds. In this paper, we\nseek to formulate comprehensive and interpretable topological generalization\nbounds free of intractable mutual information terms. To this end, we introduce\na novel learning theoretic framework that departs from the existing strategies\nvia proof techniques rooted in algorithmic stability. By extending an existing\nnotion of \\textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \\textit{trajectory stability},\nwe prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be\nupper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the\ntrajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory\nstability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental\nevaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great\nimportance, especially as the number of training samples grows.

These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,\nmaking them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a\nnew approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved\ndata efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time\nscaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL\nsamples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL\ntraining with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or\nextensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more\nefficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves\ninference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate\nour approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS\nsurpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy\nusing only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%\nimprovement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning\nbenchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU.

Since\ndifferent discrete emotions may exist at the same time, compared with\nsingle-class emotion recognition, emotion distribution learning (EDL) that\nidentifies a mixture of basic emotions has gradually emerged as a trend.\nHowever, existing EDL methods face challenges in mining the heterogeneity among\nmultiple modalities. Besides, rich semantic correlations across arbitrary basic\nemotions are not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal\nemotion distribution learning framework, named HeLo, aimed at fully exploring\nthe heterogeneity and complementary information in multi-modal emotional data\nand label correlation within mixed basic emotions. Specifically, we first adopt\ncross-attention to effectively fuse the physiological data.

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume.

By combining these two techniques\nsynergistically, expensive computations are expressed as solutions to systems\nof linear equations and obtained by leveraging iterative linear system solvers.\nThis drastically reduces memory requirements, facilitating application to\nsignificantly larger amounts of data, and introduces matrix multiplication as\nthe main computational operation, which is ideal for modern hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u6602\u8d35\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "keywords": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b, \u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5, \u8def\u5f84\u6761\u4ef6\u5316, \u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97, \u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5"}}

In\nthis work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that directly infers\nboth 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectral data using\ndiffusion models. DiffSpectra formulates structure elucidation as a conditional\ngeneration process. Its denoising network is parameterized by Diffusion\nMolecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture that integrates\ntopological and geometric information. Conditioning is provided by SpecFormer,\na transformer-based spectral encoder that captures intra- and inter-spectral\ndependencies from multi-modal spectra. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffSpectra achieves high accuracy in structure elucidation, recovering exact\nstructures with 16.01% top-1 accuracy and 96.86% top-20 accuracy through\nsampling. The model benefits significantly from 3D geometric modeling,\nSpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning.

Recent large\nlanguage model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but\neffectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step\nplanning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce\nDeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic\nframework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional\ntemplate-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs\nin a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is\nattempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently\nproposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these\nsuggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks\nbefore the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for\nfurther evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway\nexploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline\nthrough benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to\nidentify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we\ndevelop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human\nchemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm.

Project website:\n  https://jaysparrow.github.io/rit", "summary": "This paper addresses the challenges of Rhythmic Insertion Tasks (RIT), where\na robot must repeatedly perform high-precision insertions, such as screwing a\nnut into a bolt with a wrench. The inherent difficulty of RIT lies in achieving\nmillimeter-level accuracy and maintaining consistent performance over multiple\nrepetitions, particularly when factors like nut rotation and friction introduce\nadditional complexity. We propose a sim-to-real framework that integrates a\nreinforcement learning-based insertion policy with a failure forecasting\nmodule. By representing the wrench's pose in the nut's coordinate frame rather\nthan the robot's frame, our approach significantly enhances sim-to-real\ntransferability.

We also propose a new evaluation framework\nfor multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional\nsimilarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.\nValidated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models\nin fidelity and utility.

These challenges significantly hinder model performance,\nas intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while\ncross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and\ntransferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains.

While dense retrieval methods have substantially improved semantic\nmatching for general queries, they consistently underperform on queries with\nexplicit temporal constraints--often those containing numerical expressions and\ntime specifiers such as ``in 2015.'' Existing approaches to Temporal\nInformation Retrieval (TIR) improve temporal reasoning but often suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to reduced performance on non-temporal\nqueries. To address this, we propose Time-Specifier Model Merging (TSM), a\nnovel method that enhances temporal retrieval while preserving accuracy on\nnon-temporal queries. TSM trains specialized retrievers for individual time\nspecifiers and merges them in to a unified model, enabling precise handling of\ntemporal constraints without compromising non-temporal retrieval.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven remarkable\nprogress, a significant gap remains between their powerful informal reasoning\ncapabilities and their weak formal proving performance. Recent studies show\nthat the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on\nbenchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current\nstate-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are\ntrained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of\nshallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a\nnovel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof\ngeneration. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful,\ngeneral-purpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an\nefficient Prover to rigorously verify them. This modular design liberates the\nmodel's full reasoning potential and bypasses the pitfalls of end-to-end\ntraining.

Additionally, we leverage\nclassical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase\ntransitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region\nsize increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between\ntrainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren\nplateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to\nexist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm\nin practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone''\nwhere gradients decay polynomially.

Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to\nsubstantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot\nbe directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,\nUS speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body\nmicrostructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that\nobtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by\npioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also\ncannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm\nfor speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is\nthat applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces\ntissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,\nwhile preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective\nspeckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and\nisolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,\nSpeckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based\ndenoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic\nsimulated US images and human carotid US images.

Our approach extracts motion trajectories\nfrom input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance\nsymbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically\naccurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation\nwithout requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in\nClassical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,\nour method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves\nthe physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u903c\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "keywords": "\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210, \u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52, \u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50, \u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9, \u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u5b66"}}

However, prior\nmethods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or\nfail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be\neasily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against\nautomatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack\nframework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on\nperceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.\nSpecifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by\nleveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the\nsusceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human\nvisual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a\ngradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible\nperturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and\nmodel architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive\nattack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch\ninvisibility compared to existing baselines.

FO-MADS first constructs a dual\nfractional-order feature library by jointly applying Caputo and\nGr\\\"unwald-Letnikov derivatives, thereby amplifying micro-perturbations and\nslow drifts in the VPQ signal. A two-stage hierarchical classifier then\npinpoints the affected inverter and isolates the faulty IGBT switch,\neffectively alleviating class imbalance. Robustness is further strengthened\nthrough Progressive Memory-Replay Adversarial Training (PMR-AT), whose\nattack-aware loss is dynamically re-weighted via Online Hard Example Mining\n(OHEM) to prioritise the most challenging samples. Experiments on a\nfour-inverter microgrid testbed comprising 1 normal and 24 fault classes under\nfour attack scenarios demonstrate diagnostic accuracies of 96.6 % (bias), 94.0\n% (noise), 92.8 % (data replacement), and 95.7 % (replay), while sustaining\n96.7 % under attack-free conditions. These results establish FO-MADS as a\ncost-effective and readily deployable solution that markedly enhances the\ncyber-physical resilience of smart microgrids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6848FO-MADS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u6570\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u5e93\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u9762\u4e34\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u8bbe\u5907\u6216\u4e25\u82db\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Caputo\u548cGr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov\u5bfc\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5206\u6570\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u5e93\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548cPMR-AT\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf924\u79cd\u6545\u969c\u548c4\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5747\u8d85\u8fc792%\uff0c\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u5173\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u630196.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "FO-MADS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u5fae\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "keywords": "\u5fae\u7535\u7f51, \u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb, \u5206\u6570\u9636\u5bfc\u6570, \u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad, \u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3"}}

Traditional\nmethods using wind tunnels and Computational Fluid Dynamics, such as Large-Eddy\nSimulations (LES), are limited by high costs, computational demands, and time\nrequirements. This study presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for fast\nand accurate predictions of urban wind flow fields, reducing computation time\nfrom an order of 10 hours on 32 CPUs for one LES evaluation to an order of 1\nsecond on a single GPU using the DNN model. We employ a U-Net architecture\ntrained on LES data including 252 synthetic urban configurations at seven wind\ndirections ($0^{o}$ to $90^{o}$ in $15^{o}$ increments). The model predicts two\nkey quantities of interest: mean velocity magnitude and streamwise turbulence\nintensity, at multiple heights within the urban canopy. The U-net uses 2D\nbuilding representations augmented with signed distance functions and their\ngradients as inputs, forming a $256\\times256\\times9$ tensor. In addition, a\nSpatial Attention Module is used for feature transfer through skip connections.\nThe loss function combines the root-mean-square error of predictions, their\ngradient magnitudes, and L2 regularization. Model evaluation on 50 test cases\ndemonstrates high accuracy with an overall mean relative error of 9.3% for\nvelocity magnitude and 5.2% for turbulence intensity.

To improve GPU utilization, Chunked Prefill mixes prefill and decode\nrequests within the same batch, but introduces phase interference between\nprefill and decode.\n  While existing PD disaggregation solutions separate the phases across GPUs,\nwe ask: can the same decoupling be achieved within a single serving engine?

Preprint version", "summary": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by\nleveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration\nproblem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a\ndenoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions\nbetween these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In\nthis paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and\nidentify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts\nbetween the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal\nfluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these\ninstabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive\nGradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD\nintegrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up\nstrategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum\n(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD\nsignificantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art\nperformance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

This paper presents a novel approach\nto designing software sensors for nonlinear dynamical systems expressed in\ntheir most general form. Unlike traditional model-based observers that rely on\nexplicit transformations or linearization, the proposed framework integrates\nneural networks with adaptive Sliding Mode Control (SMC) to design a robust\nstate observer under a less restrictive set of conditions. The learning process\nis driven by available sensor measurements, which are used to correct the\nobserver's state estimate. The training methodology leverages the system's\ngoverning equations as a physics-based constraint, enabling observer synthesis\nwithout access to ground-truth state trajectories. By employing a time-varying\ngain matrix dynamically adjusted by the neural network, the observer adapts in\nreal-time to system changes, ensuring robustness against noise, external\ndisturbances, and variations in system dynamics. Furthermore, we provide\nsufficient conditions to guarantee estimation error convergence, establishing a\ntheoretical foundation for the observer's reliability. The methodology's\neffectiveness is validated through simulations on challenging examples,\nincluding systems with non-differentiable dynamics and varying observability\nconditions.

While many modern\napproaches incorporate context-aware inputs (e.g., spacing, speed, relative\nspeed), they frequently overlook structured stochasticity that arises from\nlatent driver intentions, perception errors, and memory effects -- factors that\nare not directly observable from context alone. To fill the gap, this study\nintroduces an interpretable stochastic modeling framework that captures not\nonly context-dependent dynamics but also residual variability beyond what\ncontext can explain. Leveraging deep neural networks integrated with\nnonstationary Gaussian processes (GPs), our model employs a scenario-adaptive\nGibbs kernel to learn dynamic temporal correlations in acceleration decisions,\nwhere the strength and duration of correlations between acceleration decisions\nevolve with the driving context.

However, in cross-modal\nsettings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges\ndue to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the\ncomplementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,\nindependently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and\nreconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and\nenhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse\nmultimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge\ndistillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks.

However, a key limitation is the\nuse of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global\ninformation, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the\ninput query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether\npre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware\nvisual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find\ndiffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text\nalignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus\nthe model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to\nalign these features with large language models and uncover a leakage\nphenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the\noriginal diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a\nmitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion\nstrategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We\nevaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,\nparticularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional\nreasoning.
