### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Key words: 大型语言模型,认知偏差,预训练,微调,跨调换

TL;DR: 该论文通过两阶段因果实验方法，研究了预训练和微调对大型语言模型认知偏差的影响，发现偏差主要源于预训练阶段。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中认知偏差的来源，区分预训练、微调和随机噪声对偏差的影响。

Method: 采用两步骤实验方法：1）多次微调以研究随机性影响；2）引入跨调换（cross-tuning）方法，通过交换指令数据集隔离偏差来源。

Result: 偏差受预训练主导，而非微调或随机噪声，相同预训练模型的偏差模式更相似。

Conclusion: 理解微调模型的偏差需考虑预训练背景，这为未来评估和减轻语言模型偏差提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Key words: 大型语言模型, 社会科学调查, 末位选项偏差, 扰动实验, 鲁棒性测试

TL;DR: 研究通过扰动实验揭示大型语言模型（LLMs）在标准化调查中的响应不稳定性，尤其是末位选项偏差（recency bias），并强调提示设计和鲁棒性测试的重要性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为社会科学调查代理的可靠性和对已知响应偏见的敏感性。

Method: 在World Values Survey（WVS）问题上对9种LLMs施加11种扰动（包括问题表述和答案结构调整），进行167,000次模拟访谈。

Result: 发现所有模型均表现出末位选项偏差；大模型更鲁棒但仍对语义变化敏感；LLMs部分符合人类调查响应偏见。

Conclusion: 使用LLMs生成合成调查数据时，需重视提示设计和鲁棒性测试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Key words: 合成文本评估,隐私保护,大型语言模型,高危领域

TL;DR: SynthTextEval是一个用于全面评估合成文本的工具包，支持多维度评估，包括实用性、公平性、隐私风险等，旨在提升合成文本的可行性和AI开发中的隐私保护。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型生成文本的流畅性提升，合成文本在高风险领域的隐私保护潜力需要系统化评估。

Method: SynthTextEval允许用户上传或生成合成文本，并从实用性、公平性、隐私风险等多维度进行标准化评估。

Result: 工具包在医疗和法律等高危领域的数据集上展现出功能性和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估指标，SynthTextEval提高了合成文本的可行性，并促进了AI开发中的隐私保护。

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Key words: 大型语言模型, 医学领域, 安全性评估, 红队测试, 患者安全

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对医学领域的大型语言模型（LLM）安全性评估协议，从患者和临床医生的角度出发，填补了现有文献中医学领域安全性评估的空白。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医学领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，尤其是对患者和临床医生等不同用户角色的潜在影响。现有的安全性评估主要针对通用领域，缺乏对医学领域的针对性研究。

Method: 论文设计了一种专门针对医学领域的安全性评估协议，包括患者视角的安全性评估（通过PatientSafetyBench，包含466个样本的5个关键类别）和临床医生视角的评估。同时，以MediPhi模型集合为例，应用了红队测试方法。

Result: 研究首次提出了从患者、临床医生和普通用户三个视角定义医学LLM的安全性评估标准，为医学领域的安全部署奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 论文填补了医学LLM安全性评估的空白，为未来医学领域的LLM安全部署提供了方法论支持和实践案例。

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: AI支持在协作学习中对教师监控有重要作用，但现有打断检测研究多针对单对话环境，多组对话中的重叠语音问题亟需解决。

Method: 分析了单对话和多组对话中的打断检测，开发了一种针对重叠语音鲁棒的先进打断识别方法。

Result: 提出了一种在多组对话环境中有效的打断检测方法，并揭示了打断在协作学习中的语言和韵律特征。

Conclusion: 该研究为在多组对话中处理重叠语音问题提供了新方法，并为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)
*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Key words: 大型语言模型,检索增强生成,多智能体,反虚假信息,健康信息

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体的检索增强框架，用于生成高质量的反健康虚假信息言论，结合静态和动态证据，优化知识检索和响应生成。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有研究依赖有限证据且对最终输出控制不足，需改进反虚假信息言论的生成方法。

Method: 采用多智能体检索增强框架，通过多个LLM优化知识检索、证据增强和响应精炼。

Result: 方法在礼貌性、相关性、信息量和事实准确性上优于基线，并通过消融实验和人工评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能生成高质量的反虚假信息言论，且精炼过程显著提升质量并获人类偏好。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

Key words: Deep-Learning, GNN, CNN, 长文本处理, 图生成, 文本分类

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合GNN和CNN的新型模型架构，用于高效处理长文本，通过实时端到端图生成机制和LLM信息增强，在文本分类任务中表现出色。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前Transformer模型在处理长文本时计算复杂度高，效率低下，因此需要一种更高效的模型架构。

Method: 结合GNN和CNN，使用实时端到端图生成机制，利用LLM提供的信息，通过CNN捕捉局部上下文模式，并通过图结构扩展局部感受野。

Result: 模型生成的图显示出有意义的语义组织结构，聚类系数约0.45，最短路径长度在4至5之间，在文本分类任务中表现高效且具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型在长文本处理中表现出高效性，验证了其在文本分类任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决医疗领域AI输出的个性化与可理解性问题，提升患者教育和平等获取AI服务的可及性。

Method: 引入MedReadCtrl框架，通过可读性控制调整LLM输出，评估了九个数据集和三个任务。

Result: MedReadCtrl显著优于GPT-4，专家更偏好其输出（71.7% vs. 23.3%），尤其在低文化水平群体中表现优异。

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl能有效重构临床内容为可访问的语言，支持患者教育，扩展AI医疗的平等可及性。

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

Key words: 社会决定因素, 驱逐, 电子健康记录, LLMs, 自动提示优化

TL;DR: 本文提出了SynthEHR-Eviction管道，结合LLMs、人类标注和自动提示优化，用于从临床记录中提取驱逐信息，构建了最大的公开驱逐相关SDoH数据集，模型性能优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 驱逐是影响健康的重要社会决定因素，但缺乏研究和结构化数据，临床记录中的信息未被充分利用。

Method: 结合LLMs、人类标注和自动提示优化（APO）构建SynthEHR-Eviction管道，提取临床记录中的驱逐信息。

Result: 数据集包含14个精细类别，模型性能（Macro-F1）优于GPT-4o-APO、GPT-4o-mini-APO和BioBERT，同时降低80%标注成本。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、可扩展，适用于其他信息提取任务。

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

*Matthieu Boileau,Philippe Helluy,Jeremy Pawlus,Svitlana Vyetrenko*

Key words: 时间序列推理、蒸馏学习、可解释模型、轻量化模型、自然语言注释

TL;DR: 通过将时间序列推理能力蒸馏到小型指令调优语言模型，构建可解释的时间序列基础模型，展示了轻量化模型在自然语言中解释时间模式的能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究目标是开发可解释的时间序列基础模型，通过轻量化语言模型解释时间序列模式，适合隐私敏感或设备端部署。

Method: 利用合成数据集（均值回归时间序列），通过大型多模态模型生成自然语言注释，指导小型Qwen模型的微调，并引入评估指标（趋势方向、噪声强度、极值定位）。

Result: 微调后的模型获得有意义的解释能力，验证了轻量化模型压缩时间序列理解的可行性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发小型、可解释的时间序列语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [11] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Key words: LLM代理,SAND,行动思考,自洽采样,微调

TL;DR: 本文提出SAND框架，通过让LLM代理在行动前明确思考候选行动，解决了传统方法因有限探索导致次优行动的问题，实验显示其性能优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有LLM代理训练方法过度依赖专家行为模仿或偏好优化，可能导致行动空间探索不足，产生次优行动。

Method: 提出SAND框架，结合自洽行动采样和执行引导的行动评价，生成逐步思考，并用这些轨迹微调代理。

Result: 在两个交互任务中，SAND比初始监督微调平均提升20%，且优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: SAND通过行动思考显著提升代理性能，证明了探索候选行动的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

Key words: 强化学习, 语言模型, 训练优化, 轨迹重放, RLEP框架

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RLEP的两阶段强化学习框架，通过重新播放已验证的高质量轨迹来加速训练并提升模型性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在强化学习训练中能耗高、训练不稳定以及策略漂移的问题。

Method: RLEP分为两阶段：1) 收集已验证的轨迹；2) 在后续训练中重放这些成功轨迹，结合新生成的路径进行优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如AIME-2024准确率从38.2%提升至39.9%，AMC-2023从77.0%提升至82.2%。

Conclusion: RLEP通过重放高质量样本，减少了无效探索，加速了收敛，最终提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 旨在研究LLM中突发性失真的现象，并提供一个统一的理论框架。

Method: 提出“胡扯指数”和四种胡扯分类（空话、敷衍、模棱两可和未经核实的说法），并在多个数据集上进行评估。

Result: 实验发现RLHF和CoT提示会显著增加胡扯现象，政治领域中模棱两可的策略尤为普遍。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI对齐的系统性挑战，并为进一步提升LLM真实性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

Result: 在多个基准测试中获得显著性能提升，尤其是在域外数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING是提升小型语言模型任务特定性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 增强LLM的推理能力是研究重点，当前方法存在对复杂数据结构和算法的过度依赖，限制了核心推理能力的提升。

Method: 提出了TeaR方法，结合数据优化和强化学习，指导模型在代码相关任务中发现最优推理路径。

Result: 在17个基准测试中，TeaR显著提升了模型性能，Qwen2.5-7B和R1-Distilled-7B分别提升了35.9%和5.9%。

Conclusion: TeaR通过优化推理路径，有效提升了LLM的泛化推理能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Result: 研究表明LLM无法完成超过一定复杂度的计算和代理任务，也无法验证这些任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM的局限性，对实际应用中任务复杂度的选择具有指导意义。

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 由于心理支持需求增长，但相关数据集稀缺，尤其是非英语语言领域，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过Dialog Generator和Dialog Modifier生成并优化心理辅导对话，构建CPsDD数据集，并开发CADSS系统进行分析和交互。

Result: 实验结果在策略预测和情感支持对话任务中显示，CADSS在CPsDD和ESConv数据集上表现最优。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了心理支持领域的数据稀缺问题，并验证了系统的实用性。

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Method: 在日语三人对话数据集上训练多个VAP模型，仅使用声学数据预测未来语音活动。

Result: 三人对话训练的VAP模型表现优于基线，但对话类型对准确性有影响。

Conclusion: VAP可用于三人对话的轮流发言预测，未来将应用于口语对话系统。

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Method: 使用少样本提示方法，结合提示工程技术（如LLM辩论和多样本选择策略），构建了一个竞争性主观性检测系统。

Result: 在CheckThat! 2025的主观性检测任务中，系统在阿拉伯语和波兰语中排名第一，在意大利语、英语、德语和多语言赛道中进入前四，特别在阿拉伯语数据上表现稳健。

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Result: 检索是跨语言场景的关键瓶颈，提出的策略显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 改进多语言检索对实际RAG应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Method: 通过系统实验分析SFT和RL在多种多模态推理基准中的表现及结合策略（如阶段训练、数据混合和模型合并）。

Result: SFT提升复杂问题性能但导致冗余，RL提高泛化性但难以解决最困难的问题；两者结合未能实现叠加效果。

Conclusion: 需要更无缝和自适应的方法来充分发挥联合后训练技术的潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

Conclusion: M4Doc通过单模态到多模态对齐有效解决了DIMT的挑战，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Conclusion: 方法证明了离散扩散模型的后验概率可以通过轻量级集成有效估计，显著提升语言模型性能。

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注RAG的准确性和召回率，而忽略了检索效率的重要性。本文旨在证明通过简单改进提示和少量训练样本即可提高RAG性能。

Method: 使用改进提示的标准ReAct流程，并结合少量监督和基于强化学习的微调，以减少检索次数并提升效率。

Result: 在HotPotQA等基准测试中，改进的ReAct流程优于现有方法；同时，通过微调能以更少的检索次数实现竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 大规模微调并非提升RAG的必要条件，且效率可以通过简单改进提示和少量训练样本显著提高。

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

Method: 研究将PCR分为四类表面形式，并收集了500个自然生成的PCR样本，评估了最先进的大语言模型（LLM），并重新评估了拼音提示策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提供了首个全面的中文PCR分类、真实数据集和轻量级改进方法，推动了毒性检测的鲁棒性研究。

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

Result: 实验表明NOIR能有效捕捉语义保留与长度压缩的权衡，并与人类对摘要质量的感知一致。

Conclusion: NOIR为评估和改进摘要算法、提示词及合成摘要提供了自动化工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Key words: Transformer, 注意力机制, Simulated Attention Score, 参数效率, 多头注意力

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Simulated Attention Score (SAS)的方法，通过模拟更多的注意力头和更大的隐藏维度来提升模型性能，同时保持参数效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究发现，增加注意力头的数量和隐藏维度可以提高Transformer的性能，但会引入额外的参数开销。因此，本文旨在提出一种方法，既能模拟更大规模的注意力机制，又能控制参数成本。

Method: 提出SAS方法，通过将低维的注意力头表示投影到高维空间，模拟更多的注意力和更大的隐藏维度。同时，引入Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA)来控制参数开销。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务上的实验表明，SAS方法显著优于其他注意力变体。

Conclusion: SAS方法在提升模型性能的同时保持了参数效率，为注意力机制的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 针对大型语言模型（LLMs）微调的高资源消耗问题，以及传统RAG实现的可扩展性和准确性不足，提出了K2RAG框架来解决这些挑战。

Method: K2RAG采用分治法，结合密集和稀疏向量搜索、知识图谱及文本摘要技术，并通过数据预处理步骤减少训练时间。

Result: 在MultiHopRAG数据集上的测试表明，K2RAG的平均答案相似度得分为0.57，Q3相似度为0.82，训练时间减少93%，执行速度快40%，VRAM需求减少三倍。

Conclusion: K2RAG在准确性、效率和可扩展性方面显著优于传统RAG实现，为解决LLM知识扩展问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

Key words: 文本嵌入,隐私安全,Vec2Text,量化技术,自然语言处理

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本嵌入的隐私安全问题，验证了Vec2Text方法能通过嵌入还原原始文本，并探讨了防御措施。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统认为传输文本嵌入而非原始文本是隐私保护的，但Vec2Text方法挑战了这一观点，促使进一步验证嵌入的安全性。

Method: 复制Vec2Text框架，验证其原始结论，并通过参数敏感性分析、敏感输入重构实验及量化技术评估其隐私风险。

Result: Vec2Text在理想条件下能有效还原文本甚至无语义密码，但输入长度敏感；高斯噪声和量化技术可缓解隐私风险。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用文本嵌入，量化技术是简单有效的防御手段，未来需研究更鲁棒的NLP系统防御机制。

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的训练后对齐是一个关键挑战，因为并非所有词元对模型性能的贡献均等。

Method: 利用当前策略与参考模型间的词元级对数概率差异，优先处理高影响词元。

Result: 实验表明，选择性DPO方法在Arena-Hard和MT-Bench等基准测试中优于标准DPO和蒸馏基线，且参考模型质量显著影响词元选择准确性。

Conclusion: 词元级优化和参考模型选择对提升LLM偏好对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

Result: 实验表明StreamUni在流式语音翻译任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: StreamUni通过统一模型解决了传统方法的分割和策略问题，显著提升了翻译质量和延迟性能。

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 将符号知识融入数据驱动学习算法需要语义一致的连续逻辑公式表示，并且这些表示必须是可逆的。

Method: 通过训练一个Transformer解码器模型，反转STL公式的语义嵌入，利用STL语法构建小词汇表。

Result: 模型在1个周期后即可生成有效公式，约10个周期后能泛化逻辑语义，并能生成更简单且语义接近的公式。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种复杂度训练数据中表现良好，并成功应用于分类任务的STL规范挖掘。

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'

on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 开发了一个自动化流程，利用LLM和工具链生成分子动力学模拟输入文件，显著减少设置时间和人工错误。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统的手动准备分子动力学模拟输入文件费时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合Gemini 2.0 Flash、Python脚本和Selenium自动化工具，通过CHARMM GUI生成NAMD输入文件，并利用LLM迭代优化。

Result: 流程显著减少输入文件生成时间，减少人工错误，支持并行处理多个蛋白质系统。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架为计算结构生物学中使用LLM提供了可扩展和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决现有动态主题建模技术支离破碎、缺乏解释性和用户友好探索支持的问题。

Conclusion: DTECT是一个开源工具，为动态主题探索提供了强大的支持。

Abstract: The explosive growth of textual data over time presents a significant
challenge in uncovering evolving themes and trends. Existing dynamic topic
modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that
lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We
introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end
system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal
insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing,
multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the
topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances
interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend
analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with
document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for
intuitive data querying. By integrating these features into a single, cohesive
platform, DTECT empowers users to more effectively track and understand
thematic dynamics. DTECT is open-source and available at

TL;DR: SAGE是一个基于视觉语言模型的框架，通过自引导事实增强和熵感知直接偏好优化，提升工业异常检测与推理能力，并在零样本和单样本设置中表现优越。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在工业异常检测与推理中表现不足，尤其是在提供可解释性推理和泛化到未见类别方面，需要更精准的结构化和情境感知分析。

Method: 提出SAGE框架，结合自引导事实增强（SFE）和熵感知直接偏好优化（E-DPO），并引入AD-PL数据集和Multiscale Logical Evaluation（MLE）评估框架。

Result: SAGE在工业异常数据集中的零样本和单样本设置中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAGE通过整合领域知识和专家偏好优化，显著提升了工业异常推理能力。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

TL;DR: MIRIX是一种模块化多代理内存系统，解决了AI记忆的核心挑战，支持多模态记忆，显著提升性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有AI记忆系统功能有限，难以实现个性化、抽象化和可靠记忆。MIRIX旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MIRIX采用六种结构化内存类型和动态多代理框架，支持多模态数据的高效存储与检索。

Result: 在ScreenshotVQA和LOCOMO基准测试中，MIRIX分别取得35%准确率提升和85.4%的最优性能。

Conclusion: MIRIX为记忆增强型LLM代理设定了新标准，并提供实际应用以确保隐私。

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语言模型中隐式奖励模型（IM-RM）与显式奖励模型（EX-RM）在泛化能力上的差异，发现IM-RM更依赖表面标记级线索，导致其在分布内外泛化能力较差。

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探索IM-RM和EX-RM在泛化能力上存在差异的根本原因，以理解不同奖励模型设计对语言模型行为的影响。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析IM-RM和EX-RM的差异，验证IM-RM依赖标记级线索的假设，并排除其他可能的解释。

Result: IM-RM因依赖标记级线索而在分布内外泛化能力较差，设计选择对奖励模型的泛化行为有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，奖励模型的微小设计差异可能导致泛化能力的显著不同，强调了设计选择的重要性。

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

Result: LLM-w-Ref与专家判断高度相关；小模型如MedGemma-27B表现优于大型专有模型如OpenAI-o3。

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench为评估LLM医学推理提供了基础工具，推动其在临床中的安全应用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 现有的视觉推理方法受限于预定义的工作流和静态工具集，PyVision旨在通过动态生成工具解决这一问题。

Method: PyVision是一种多轮交互框架，允许MLLM自主生成、执行和优化针对特定任务的Python工具。

Result: PyVision在多个基准测试中显著提升模型性能，如GPT-4.1和Claude-4.0-Sonnet分别提高7.8%和31.1%。

Conclusion: 动态工具生成使模型不仅能使用工具，还能创造工具，推动了更自主的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

Motivation: 探究前沿大语言模型在简单推理任务上的表现，揭示其失败原因，以理解模型的泛化能力和局限性。

Method: 扩展文献中的研究，创建了一套自动生成的简单推理任务（如计数、一阶逻辑、旅行规划），并引入简化版谜题数据集（Unpuzzles）。

Result: 即使最先进的思考模型也会在简单任务中失败，原因包括统计捷径、中间步骤错误和长上下文处理困难。模型在简化版谜题中的表现比原版更差。

Conclusion: 前沿语言模型在简单推理任务中的泛化能力仍然存在问题，任务简化并不总是提高模型性能。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
reasoning capabilities-achieving remarkable performance on challenging
competitive math and coding benchmarks-they also frequently fail on tasks that
are easy for humans. This work studies the performance of frontier LLMs on a
broad set of such "easy" reasoning problems. By extending previous work in the
literature, we create a suite of procedurally generated simple reasoning tasks,
including counting, first-order logic, proof trees, and travel planning, with
changeable parameters (such as document length. or the number of variables in a
math problem) that can arbitrarily increase the amount of computation required
to produce the answer while preserving the fundamental difficulty. While
previous work showed that traditional, non-thinking models can be made to fail
on such problems, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art thinking models
consistently fail on such problems and for similar reasons (e.g. statistical
shortcuts, errors in intermediate steps, and difficulties in processing long
contexts). To further understand the behavior of the models, we introduce the
unpuzzles dataset, a different "easy" benchmark consisting of trivialized
versions of well-known math and logic puzzles. Interestingly, while modern LLMs
excel at solving the original puzzles, they tend to fail on the trivialized
versions, exhibiting several systematic failure patterns related to memorizing
the originals. We show that this happens even if the models are otherwise able
to solve problems with different descriptions but requiring the same logic. Our
results highlight that out-of-distribution generalization is still problematic
for frontier language models and the new generation of thinking models, even
for simple reasoning tasks, and making tasks easier does not necessarily imply
improved performance.

Motivation: 解决传统端到端训练的资源密集型问题，探索更灵活的模型扩展方式。

Method: 使用固定的嵌入表示作为通用接口，支持模块化组合（专家混合）和逐层增长训练。

Result: 模块化组合在推理任务（如MMLU）上表现更优；逐层训练稳定且深化能力（如SQuAD）。

Conclusion: 构造性方法为资源高效扩展和持续学习提供了新途径，促进了AI开发的民主化。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Motivation: 现有的图像检索方法在时尚领域效果不佳，主要因为缺乏大规模标注数据和细粒度的视觉与语言理解能力。

Method: 通过两阶段标注流程（VLM和LLM）构建FACap数据集，并基于BLIP-2模型提出FashionBLIP-2，采用轻量适配器和多头查询-候选匹配机制。

Result: FashionBLIP-2在Fashion IQ和enhFashionIQ基准测试中显著提升了性能，尤其是在细粒度文本修改的检索任务中。

Conclusion: FACap数据集和FashionBLIP-2模型在时尚领域图像检索中表现出色，适用于高要求的电商环境。

Abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) task is to retrieve target images given a
reference image and a modification text. Recent methods for CIR leverage large
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) and achieve good performance on
general-domain concepts like color and texture. However, they still struggle
with application domains like fashion, because the rich and diverse vocabulary
used in fashion requires specific fine-grained vision and language
understanding. An additional difficulty is the lack of large-scale fashion
datasets with detailed and relevant annotations, due to the expensive cost of
manual annotation by specialists. To address these challenges, we introduce
FACap, a large-scale, automatically constructed fashion-domain CIR dataset. It
leverages web-sourced fashion images and a two-stage annotation pipeline
powered by a VLM and a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and
detailed modification texts. Then, we propose a new CIR model FashionBLIP-2,
which fine-tunes the general-domain BLIP-2 model on FACap with lightweight
adapters and multi-head query-candidate matching to better account for
fine-grained fashion-specific information. FashionBLIP-2 is evaluated with and
without additional fine-tuning on the Fashion IQ benchmark and the enhanced
evaluation dataset enhFashionIQ, leveraging our pipeline to obtain
higher-quality annotations. Experimental results show that the combination of
FashionBLIP-2 and pretraining with FACap significantly improves the model's
performance in fashion CIR especially for retrieval with fine-grained
modification texts, demonstrating the value of our dataset and approach in a
highly demanding environment such as e-commerce websites. Code is available at

Result: 语言模型能有效排序语义邻近概念（与损伤相关），并能生成绕过遗忘的对抗性提示。

Conclusion: autoeval-dmun工具自动化评估MU效果，为扩散模型的实际部署提供可信保障。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) is a promising cost-effective method to cleanse
undesired information (generated concepts, biases, or patterns) from
foundational diffusion models. While MU is orders of magnitude less costly than
retraining a diffusion model without the undesired information, it can be
challenging and labor-intensive to prove that the information has been fully
removed from the model. Moreover, MU can damage diffusion model performance on
surrounding concepts that one would like to retain, making it unclear if the
diffusion model is still fit for deployment. We introduce autoeval-dmun, an
automated tool which leverages (vision-) language models to thoroughly assess
unlearning in diffusion models. Given a target concept, autoeval-dmun extracts
structured, relevant world knowledge from the language model to identify nearby
concepts which are likely damaged by unlearning and to circumvent unlearning
with adversarial prompts. We use our automated tool to evaluate popular
diffusion model unlearning methods, revealing that language models (1) impose
semantic orderings of nearby concepts which correlate well with unlearning
damage and (2) effectively circumvent unlearning with synthetic adversarial
prompts.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有GNN方法难以捕捉链接特有的结构模式，且计算成本高或依赖简单启发式方法，无法建模多跳依赖关系。

Method: SP4LP首先利用GNN计算节点表示，然后提取最短路径序列并用序列模型处理，以高效捕捉多跳关系。

Result: 实验表明，SP4LP在链接预测基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SP4LP不仅在理论上比标准GNN更具表达力，且在实际应用中表现出色，是链接预测的通用方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to capture the link-specific
structural patterns crucial for accurate link prediction, as their node-centric
message-passing schemes overlook the subgraph structures connecting a pair of
nodes. Existing methods to inject such structural context either incur high
computational cost or rely on simplistic heuristics (e.g., common neighbor
counts) that fail to model multi-hop dependencies. We introduce SP4LP (Shortest
Path for Link Prediction), a novel framework that combines GNN-based node
encodings with sequence modeling over shortest paths. Specifically, SP4LP first
applies a GNN to compute representations for all nodes, then extracts the
shortest path between each candidate node pair and processes the resulting
sequence of node embeddings using a sequence model. This design enables SP4LP
to capture expressive multi-hop relational patterns with computational
efficiency. Empirically, SP4LP achieves state-of-the-art performance across
link prediction benchmarks. Theoretically, we prove that SP4LP is strictly more
expressive than standard message-passing GNNs and several state-of-the-art
structural features methods, establishing it as a general and principled
approach for link prediction in graphs.

Abstract: Merging parameter-efficient task experts has recently gained growing
attention as a way to build modular architectures that can be rapidly adapted
on the fly for specific downstream tasks, without requiring additional
fine-tuning. Typically, LoRA serves as the foundational building block of such
parameter-efficient modular architectures, leveraging low-rank weight
structures to reduce the number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we
study the properties of sparse adapters, which train only a subset of weights
in the base neural network, as potential building blocks of modular
architectures. First, we propose a simple method for training highly effective
sparse adapters, which is conceptually simpler than existing methods in the
literature and surprisingly outperforms both LoRA and full fine-tuning in our
setting. Next, we investigate the merging properties of these sparse adapters
by merging adapters for up to 20 natural language processing tasks, thus
scaling beyond what is usually studied in the literature. Our findings
demonstrate that sparse adapters yield superior in-distribution performance
post-merging compared to LoRA or full model merging. Achieving strong held-out
performance remains a challenge for all methods considered.

Conclusion: Str-GCL为图表示学习提供了利用结构常识的新视角，首次直接将其纳入GCL框架，取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is a widely adopted approach in
self-supervised graph representation learning, applying contrastive objectives
to produce effective representations. However, current GCL methods primarily
focus on capturing implicit semantic relationships, often overlooking the
structural commonsense embedded within the graph's structure and attributes,
which contains underlying knowledge crucial for effective representation
learning. Due to the lack of explicit information and clear guidance in general
graph, identifying and integrating such structural commonsense in GCL poses a
significant challenge. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework called
Structural Commonsense Unveiling in Graph Contrastive Learning (Str-GCL).
Str-GCL leverages first-order logic rules to represent structural commonsense
and explicitly integrates them into the GCL framework. It introduces
topological and attribute-based rules without altering the original graph and
employs a representation alignment mechanism to guide the encoder in
effectively capturing this commonsense. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first attempt to directly incorporate structural commonsense into GCL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Str-GCL outperforms existing GCL
methods, providing a new perspective on leveraging structural commonsense in
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Accurately modeling malware propagation is essential for designing effective
cybersecurity defenses, particularly against adaptive threats that evolve in
real time. While traditional epidemiological models and recent neural
approaches offer useful foundations, they often fail to fully capture the
nonlinear feedback mechanisms present in real-world networks. In this work, we
apply scientific machine learning to malware modeling by evaluating three
approaches: classical Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), Universal
Differential Equations (UDEs), and Neural ODEs. Using data from the Code Red
worm outbreak, we show that the UDE approach substantially reduces prediction
error compared to both traditional and neural baselines by 44%, while
preserving interpretability. We introduce a symbolic recovery method that
transforms the learned neural feedback into explicit mathematical expressions,
revealing suppression mechanisms such as network saturation, security response,
and malware variant evolution. Our results demonstrate that hybrid
physics-informed models can outperform both purely analytical and purely neural
approaches, offering improved predictive accuracy and deeper insight into the
dynamics of malware spread. These findings support the development of early
warning systems, efficient outbreak response strategies, and targeted cyber
defense interventions.

Conclusion: CCQ在极低位量化下显著降低部署门槛，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) elevates inference costs
and compounds substantial deployment barriers. While quantization to 8 or 4
bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and
efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an
inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits
with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or
slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding
and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code
Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a
lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and
weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing
on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the
performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions.
Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs
across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to
184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE
4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B
model and inference engine have been open-sourced.

Result: G-Guard在所有数据集和评估指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G-Guard通过图神经网络和注意力机制有效防御多轮越狱攻击，展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread popularity and are
increasingly integrated into various applications. However, their capabilities
can be exploited for both benign and harmful purposes. Despite rigorous
training and fine-tuning for safety, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks. Recently, multi-turn attacks have emerged, exacerbating the issue.
Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks gradually escalate the dialogue,
making them more difficult to detect and mitigate, even after they are
identified.
  In this study, we propose G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware GNN-based
input classifier designed to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks on
LLMs. G-Guard constructs an entity graph for multi-turn queries, explicitly
capturing relationships between harmful keywords and queries even when those
keywords appear only in previous queries. Additionally, we introduce an
attention-aware augmentation mechanism that retrieves the most similar
single-turn query based on the multi-turn conversation. This retrieved query is
treated as a labeled node in the graph, enhancing the ability of GNN to
classify whether the current query is harmful. Evaluation results demonstrate
that G-Guard outperforms all baselines across all datasets and evaluation
metrics.

Result: 实验表明，DeMul在11个识别数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DeMul方法通过消除描述提取过程，显著提升了提示的语义丰富性和模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在时间序列预测中存在源分布僵化和采样路径受限的问题，而流匹配技术虽具潜力但尚未充分挖掘其优势。

Method: 结合辅助模型的预测误差信息，利用历史数据作为条件，构建双面条件概率路径，并使用一般仿射路径扩展概率路径空间。

Result: 实验表明，CGFM在多个任务中优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CGFM通过创新地利用辅助模型的误差信息，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和灵活性。

Abstract: Diffusion models, a type of generative model, have shown promise in time
series forecasting. But they face limitations like rigid source distributions
and limited sampling paths, which hinder their performance. Flow matching
offers faster generation, higher-quality outputs, and greater flexibility,
while also possessing the ability to utilize valuable information from the
prediction errors of prior models, which were previously inaccessible yet
critically important. To address these challenges and fully unlock the untapped
potential of flow matching, we propose Conditional Guided Flow Matching (CGFM).
CGFM extends flow matching by incorporating the outputs of an auxiliary model,
enabling a previously unattainable capability in the field: learning from the
errors of the auxiliary model. For time series forecasting tasks, it integrates
historical data as conditions and guidance, constructs two-sided conditional
probability paths, and uses a general affine path to expand the space of
probability paths, ultimately leading to improved predictions. Extensive
experiments show that CGFM consistently enhances and outperforms
state-of-the-art models, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing
forecasting methods.

Conclusion: WSA架构为解决强化学习中多预训练模型结合问题提供了一种高效且性能优异的新方法。

Abstract: The recent focus and release of pre-trained models have been a key components
to several advancements in many fields (e.g. Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision), as a matter of fact, pre-trained models learn disparate
latent embeddings sharing insightful representations. On the other hand,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on maximizing the cumulative reward
obtained via agent's interaction with the environment. RL agents do not have
any prior knowledge about the world, and they either learn from scratch an
end-to-end mapping between the observation and action spaces or, in more recent
works, are paired with monolithic and computationally expensive Foundational
Models. How to effectively combine and leverage the hidden information of
different pre-trained models simultaneously in RL is still an open and
understudied question. In this work, we propose Weight Sharing Attention (WSA),
a new architecture to combine embeddings of multiple pre-trained models to
shape an enriched state representation, balancing the tradeoff between
efficiency and performance. We run an extensive comparison between several
combination modes showing that WSA obtains comparable performance on multiple
Atari games compared to end-to-end models. Furthermore, we study the
generalization capabilities of this approach and analyze how scaling the number
of models influences agents' performance during and after training.

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定条件下能有效捕捉组合结构，且线性解码性可作为组合泛化的指标。

Abstract: Can neural networks systematically capture discrete, compositional task
structure despite their continuous, distributed nature? The impressive
capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this
question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still
frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we
seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize
over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data
and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds
across different task encodings as long as the training distribution
sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that
standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of
compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number
of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that
if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task
can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric
correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known
concepts.

Conclusion: DeCoLe为解决标签偏差导致的错误标记提供了有效工具，可提升组织数据管理的可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable data is a cornerstone of modern organizational systems. A notable
data integrity challenge stems from label bias, which refers to systematic
errors in a label, a covariate that is central to a quantitative analysis, such
that its quality differs across social groups. This type of bias has been
conceptually and empirically explored and is widely recognized as a pressing
issue across critical domains. However, effective methodologies for addressing
it remain scarce. In this work, we propose Decoupled Confident Learning
(DeCoLe), a principled machine learning based framework specifically designed
to detect mislabeled instances in datasets affected by label bias, enabling
bias aware mislabelling detection and facilitating data quality improvement. We
theoretically justify the effectiveness of DeCoLe and evaluate its performance
in the impactful context of hate speech detection, a domain where label bias is
a well documented challenge. Empirical results demonstrate that DeCoLe excels
at bias aware mislabeling detection, consistently outperforming alternative
approaches for label error detection. Our work identifies and addresses the
challenge of bias aware mislabeling detection and offers guidance on how DeCoLe
can be integrated into organizational data management practices as a powerful
tool to enhance data reliability.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了Koopman算子学习的稳定性和可扩展性，适合现代深度学习流程。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear
dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic
mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to
identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this
idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to
learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these
methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable
operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value
decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can
introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In
this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning
the top-k singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical
systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates
the need for unstable linear algebraic operations and integrates easily into
modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned
singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as
eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

Abstract: Data driven approaches have the potential to make modeling complex, nonlinear
physical phenomena significantly more computationally tractable. For example,
computational modeling of fracture is a core challenge where machine learning
techniques have the potential to provide a much needed speedup that would
enable progress in areas such as mutli-scale modeling and uncertainty
quantification. Currently, phase field modeling (PFM) of fracture is one such
approach that offers a convenient variational formulation to model crack
nucleation, branching and propagation. To date, machine learning techniques
have shown promise in approximating PFM simulations. However, most studies rely
on overly simple benchmarks that do not reflect the true complexity of the
fracture processes where PFM excels as a method. To address this gap, we
introduce a challenging dataset based on PFM simulations designed to benchmark
and advance ML methods for fracture modeling. This dataset includes three
energy decomposition methods, two boundary conditions, and 1,000 random initial
crack configurations for a total of 6,000 simulations. Each sample contains 100
time steps capturing the temporal evolution of the crack field. Alongside this
dataset, we also implement and evaluate Physics Informed Neural Networks
(PINN), Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) and UNet models as baselines, and
explore the impact of ensembling strategies on prediction accuracy. With this
combination of our dataset and baseline models drawn from the literature we aim
to provide a standardized and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine
learning approaches to solid mechanics. Our results highlight both the promise
and limitations of popular current models, and demonstrate the utility of this
dataset as a testbed for advancing machine learning in fracture mechanics
research.

Conclusion: 研究强调了能效评估在注意力机制设计中的重要性，为选择资源高效机制提供了实践指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) grow in
scale and application, attention mechanisms have become a central computational
bottleneck due to their high memory and time complexity. While many efficient
attention variants have been proposed, there remains a lack of rigorous
evaluation on their actual energy usage and hardware resource demands during
training. In this work, we benchmark eight attention mechanisms in training
GPT-2 architecture, measuring key metrics including training time, GPU memory
usage, FLOPS, CPU usage, and power consumption. Our results reveal that
attention mechanisms with optimized kernel implementations, including Flash
Attention, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Attention, and Multi-Head Latent
Attention (MLA), achieve the best energy efficiency. We further show that lower
GPU power alone does not guarantee reduced energy use, as training time plays
an equally important role. Our study highlights the importance of energy-aware
benchmarking in attention design and provides a practical insight for selecting
resource-efficient mechanisms. All our codes are available at GitHub.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly deployed across the edge of
internet of things environments, a partitioned deep learning paradigm in which
models are split across multiple computational nodes introduces a new dimension
of security risk. Unlike traditional inference setups, these distributed
pipelines span the model computation across heterogeneous nodes and
communication layers, thereby exposing a broader attack surface to potential
adversaries. Building on these motivations, this work explores a previously
overlooked vulnerability: even when both the edge and cloud components of the
model are inaccessible (i.e., black-box), an adversary who intercepts the
intermediate features transmitted between them can still pose a serious threat.
We demonstrate that, under these mild and realistic assumptions, an attacker
can craft highly transferable proxy models, making the entire deep learning
system significantly more vulnerable to evasion attacks. In particular, the
intercepted features can be effectively analyzed and leveraged to distill
surrogate models capable of crafting highly transferable adversarial examples
against the target model. To this end, we propose an exploitation strategy
specifically designed for distributed settings, which involves reconstructing
the original tensor shape from vectorized transmitted features using simple
statistical analysis, and adapting surrogate architectures accordingly to
enable effective feature distillation. A comprehensive and systematic
experimental evaluation has been conducted to demonstrate that surrogate models
trained with the proposed strategy, i.e., leveraging intermediate features,
tremendously improve the transferability of adversarial attacks. These findings
underscore the urgent need to account for intermediate feature leakage in the
design of secure distributed deep learning systems.

Motivation: 通过多模态学习提升食物摄入动作检测性能，同时应对模态缺失带来的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种鲁棒的多模态时序卷积网络（MM-TCN-CMA），结合IMU和雷达数据，增强检测并适应模态缺失。

Result: 在多模态条件下，检测性能显著提升；在模态缺失情况下仍保持较好的表现。

Conclusion: 首次展示了结合IMU和雷达数据的多模态学习框架，有效提升了食物摄入动作检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary
monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to
support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs)
have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently,
contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores
whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through
multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address
a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality
is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional
network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and
radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing
modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating
gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made
publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework
improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU
models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still
achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This
is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that
effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统的平均治疗效果（ATE）在捕捉随剂量和时间变化的治疗效果时存在局限，特别是医疗领域需要更动态的评估方法。

Method: 团队提出了一种基于SemanticODE的框架，将治疗效果建模为剂量和时间的平滑表面，支持领域先验和后编辑。

Result: 该方法能够准确、可解释且可编辑地建模治疗效果动态，支持严谨的因果分析和实际决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险领域（如医疗）提供了动态治疗效果分析的透明和稳健工具。

Abstract: The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is a foundational metric in causal
inference, widely used to assess intervention efficacy in randomized controlled
trials (RCTs). However, in many applications -- particularly in healthcare --
this static summary fails to capture the nuanced dynamics of treatment effects
that vary with both dose and time. We propose a framework for modelling
treatment effect trajectories as smooth surfaces over dose and time, enabling
the extraction of clinically actionable insights such as onset time, peak
effect, and duration of benefit. To ensure interpretability, robustness, and
verifiability -- key requirements in high-stakes domains -- we adapt
SemanticODE, a recent framework for interpretable trajectory modelling, to the
causal setting where treatment effects are never directly observed. Our
approach decouples the estimation of trajectory shape from the specification of
clinically relevant properties (e.g., maxima, inflection points), supporting
domain-informed priors, post-hoc editing, and transparent analysis. We show
that our method yields accurate, interpretable, and editable models of
treatment dynamics, facilitating both rigorous causal analysis and practical
decision-making.

Motivation: 理解特征对模型预测的贡献是机器学习模型的重要需求，而置换特征重要性方法在特征依赖时可能产生误导性结果。

Method: 提出TRIP测试方法，检测因模型外推导致的不可靠置换特征重要性得分，并扩展至高维场景。

Result: 在模拟数据和实际应用中的测试表明，TRIP能够可靠地检测置换特征重要性得分的不可靠性。

Conclusion: TRIP提供了一种低假设需求的方法，有效解决特征依赖导致的置换特征重要性不可靠问题。

Abstract: Along with accurate prediction, understanding the contribution of each
feature to the making of the prediction, i.e., the importance of the feature,
is a desirable and arguably necessary component of a machine learning model.
For a complex model such as a random forest, such importances are not innate --
as they are, e.g., with linear regression. Efficient methods have been created
to provide such capabilities, with one of the most popular among them being
permutation feature importance due to its efficiency, model-agnostic nature,
and perceived intuitiveness. However, permutation feature importance has been
shown to be misleading in the presence of dependent features as a result of the
creation of unrealistic observations when permuting the dependent features. In
this work, we develop TRIP (Test for Reliable Interpretation via Permutation),
a test requiring minimal assumptions that is able to detect unreliable
permutation feature importance scores that are the result of model
extrapolation. To build on this, we demonstrate how the test can be
complemented in order to allow its use in high dimensional settings. Through
testing on simulated data and applications, our results show that the test can
be used to reliably detect when permutation feature importance scores are
unreliable.

Abstract: Zeroth-order local optimisation algorithms are essential for solving
real-valued black-box optimisation problems. Among these, Natural Evolution
Strategies (NES) represent a prominent class, particularly well-suited for
scenarios where prior distributions are available. By optimising the objective
function in the space of search distributions, NES algorithms naturally
integrate prior knowledge during initialisation, making them effective in
settings such as semi-supervised learning and user-prior belief frameworks.
However, due to their reliance on random sampling and Monte Carlo estimates,
NES algorithms can suffer from limited sample efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel class of algorithms, termed Probabilistic Natural
Evolutionary Strategy Algorithms (ProbNES), which enhance the NES framework
with Bayesian quadrature. We show that ProbNES algorithms consistently
outperforms their non-probabilistic counterparts as well as global sample
efficient methods such as Bayesian Optimisation (BO) or $\pi$BO across a wide
range of tasks, including benchmark test functions, data-driven optimisation
tasks, user-informed hyperparameter tuning tasks and locomotion tasks.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets often exhibit low-dimensional geometric structures,
as suggested by the manifold hypothesis, which implies that data lie on a
smooth manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space. While this
insight underpins many advances in machine learning and inverse problems, fully
leveraging it requires to deal with three key tasks: estimating the intrinsic
dimension (ID) of the manifold, constructing appropriate local coordinates, and
learning mappings between ambient and manifold spaces. In this work, we propose
a framework that addresses all these challenges using a Mixture of Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) and tools from Riemannian geometry. We specifically focus
on estimating the ID of datasets by analyzing the numerical rank of the VAE
decoder pullback metric. The estimated ID guides the construction of an atlas
of local charts using a mixture of invertible VAEs, enabling accurate manifold
parameterization and efficient inference. We how this approach enhances
solutions to ill-posed inverse problems, particularly in biomedical imaging, by
enforcing that reconstructions lie on the learned manifold. Lastly, we explore
the impact of network pruning on manifold geometry and reconstruction quality,
showing that the intrinsic dimension serves as an effective proxy for
monitoring model capacity.

Abstract: We develop a new and general encode-approximate-reconstruct operator learning
model that leverages learned neural representations of bases for input and
output function distributions. We introduce the concepts of \textit{numerical
operator learning} and \textit{discretization independence}, which clarify the
relationship between theoretical formulations and practical realizations of
operator learning models. Our model is discretization-independent, making it
particularly effective for multifidelity learning. We establish theoretical
approximation guarantees, demonstrating uniform universal approximation under
strong assumptions on the input functions and statistical approximation under
weaker conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study that
investigates how discretization independence enables robust and efficient
multifidelity operator learning. We validate our method through extensive
numerical experiments involving both local and nonlocal PDEs, including
time-independent and time-dependent problems. The results show that
multifidelity training significantly improves accuracy and computational
efficiency. Moreover, multifidelity training further enhances empirical
discretization independence.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces inherent challenges in balancing model

non-IID decentralized environments. Recent approaches either sacrifice formal
privacy guarantees, incur high overheads, or overlook quantum-enhanced
expressivity. We introduce AdeptHEQ-FL, a unified hybrid classical-quantum FL

homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure aggregation of sensitive model layers,
and (iv) dynamic layer-wise adaptive freezing to minimize communication
overhead while preserving quantum adaptability. We establish formal privacy
guarantees, provide convergence analysis, and conduct extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Fashion-MNIST datasets. AdeptHEQ-FL achieves a $\approx
25.43\%$ and $\approx 14.17\%$ accuracy improvement over Standard-FedQNN and
FHE-FedQNN, respectively, on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, it reduces
communication overhead by freezing less important layers, demonstrating the
efficiency and practicality of our privacy-preserving, resource-aware design
for FL.

Conclusion: DPVD-MARL算法在优化聚类联邦学习中表现出色，显著提升了收敛速度和模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, a secure and communication-efficient clustered federated
learning (CFL) design is proposed. In our model, several base stations (BSs)
with heterogeneous task-handling capabilities and multiple users with
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data jointly perform CFL
training incorporating differential privacy (DP) techniques. Since each BS can
process only a subset of the learning tasks and has limited wireless resource
blocks (RBs) to allocate to users for federated learning (FL) model parameter
transmission, it is necessary to jointly optimize RB allocation and user
scheduling for CFL performance optimization. Meanwhile, our considered CFL
method requires devices to use their limited data and FL model information to
determine their task identities, which may introduce additional communication
overhead. We formulate an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the
training loss of all learning tasks while considering device clustering, RB
allocation, DP noise, and FL model transmission delay. To solve the problem, we
propose a novel dynamic penalty function assisted value decomposed multi-agent
reinforcement learning (DPVD-MARL) algorithm that enables distributed BSs to
independently determine their connected users, RBs, and DP noise of the
connected users but jointly minimize the training loss of all learning tasks
across all BSs. Different from the existing MARL methods that assign a large
penalty for invalid actions, we propose a novel penalty assignment scheme that
assigns penalty depending on the number of devices that cannot meet
communication constraints (e.g., delay), which can guide the MARL scheme to
quickly find valid actions, thus improving the convergence speed. Simulation
results show that the DPVD-MARL can improve the convergence rate by up to 20%
and the ultimate accumulated rewards by 15% compared to independent Q-learning.

Result: CVAE在检测隐蔽对抗攻击方面显著优于传统的基于马氏距离的检测器。

Conclusion: 高级概率建模对于提升IDS防御自适应生成模型攻击的能力至关重要。

Abstract: The growing integration of UAVs into civilian airspace underscores the need
for resilient and intelligent intrusion detection systems (IDS), as traditional
anomaly detection methods often fail to identify novel threats. A common
approach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;
however, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.
Moreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy
adversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting
stealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a
robust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known
cyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),
man-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN
perturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as
benign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These
adversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success
rates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial
inputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based
regret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based
detectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats. Our findings emphasize
the importance of advanced probabilistic modeling to strengthen IDS
capabilities against adaptive, generative-model-based cyber intrusions.

Abstract: In this paper, deceptive signal-assisted private split learning is
investigated. In our model, several edge devices jointly perform collaborative
training, and some eavesdroppers aim to collect the model and data information
from devices. To prevent the eavesdroppers from collecting model and data
information, a subset of devices can transmit deceptive signals. Therefore, it
is necessary to determine the subset of devices used for deceptive signal
transmission, the subset of model training devices, and the models assigned to
each model training device. This problem is formulated as an optimization
problem whose goal is to minimize the information leaked to eavesdroppers while
meeting the model training energy consumption and delay constraints. To solve
this problem, we propose a soft actor-critic deep reinforcement learning
framework with intrinsic curiosity module and cross-attention (ICM-CA) that
enables a centralized agent to determine the model training devices, the
deceptive signal transmission devices, the transmit power, and sub-models
assigned to each model training device without knowing the position and
monitoring probability of eavesdroppers. The proposed method uses an ICM module
to encourage the server to explore novel actions and states and a CA module to
determine the importance of each historical state-action pair thus improving
training efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
improves the convergence rate by up to 3x and reduces the information leaked to
eavesdroppers by up to 13% compared to the traditional SAC algorithm.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate scientifically plausible but
factually invalid information, a challenge we term the "plausibility-validity
gap," particularly in specialized domains like chemistry. This paper presents a
systematic methodology to bridge this gap by developing a specialized
scientific assistant. We utilized the Magistral Small model, noted for its
integrated reasoning capabilities, and fine-tuned it using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA). A key component of our approach was the creation of a "dual-domain
dataset," a comprehensive corpus curated from various sources encompassing both
molecular properties and chemical reactions, which was standardized to ensure
quality. Our evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model achieves
significant improvements over the baseline model in format adherence, chemical
validity of generated molecules, and the feasibility of proposed synthesis
routes. The results indicate a hierarchical learning pattern, where syntactic
correctness is learned more readily than chemical possibility and synthesis
feasibility. While a comparative analysis with human experts revealed
competitive performance in areas like chemical creativity and reasoning, it
also highlighted key limitations, including persistent errors in
stereochemistry, a static knowledge cutoff, and occasional reference
hallucination. This work establishes a viable framework for adapting generalist
LLMs into reliable, specialized tools for chemical research, while also
delineating critical areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Graph transformers typically embed every node in a single Euclidean space,
blurring heterogeneous topologies. We prepend a lightweight Riemannian
mixture-of-experts layer that routes each node to various kinds of manifold,
mixture of spherical, flat, hyperbolic - best matching its local structure.
These projections provide intrinsic geometric explanations to the latent space.
Inserted into a state-of-the-art ensemble graph transformer, this projector
lifts accuracy by up to 3% on four node-classification benchmarks. The ensemble
makes sure that both euclidean and non-euclidean features are captured.
Explicit, geometry-aware projection thus sharpens predictive power while making
graph representations more interpretable.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success across
multiple domains, including competitive games, natural language processing, and
robotics. Despite these advancements, policies trained via DRL often struggle
to generalize to evaluation environments with different parameters. This
challenge is typically addressed by training with multiple contexts and/or by
leveraging additional structure in the problem. However, obtaining sufficient
training data across diverse contexts can be impractical in real-world
applications. In this work, we consider contextual Markov decision processes
(CMDPs) with transition and reward functions that exhibit regularity in context
parameters. We introduce the context-enhanced Bellman equation (CEBE) to
improve generalization when training on a single context. We prove both
analytically and empirically that the CEBE yields a first-order approximation
to the Q-function trained across multiple contexts. We then derive context
sample enhancement (CSE) as an efficient data augmentation method for
approximating the CEBE in deterministic control environments. We numerically
validate the performance of CSE in simulation environments, showcasing its
potential to improve generalization in DRL.

existing work relies on the simplifying assumptions that the positively labeled
training data is drawn from the restriction of the data generating distribution
to positively labeled instances and/or that the proportion of positively
labeled points (a.k.a. the class prior) is known apriori to the learner. This
paper provides a theoretical analysis of the statistical complexity of PU
learning under a wider range of setups. Unlike most prior work, our study does
not assume that the class prior is known to the learner. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the required sample sizes (of both the positively labeled and
the unlabeled samples).

Key words: 因果实验设计，贝叶斯框架，目标导向，变分推断

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统方法通常推断完整的因果模型，而作者希望通过目标导向的设计更高效地解决特定因果问题。

Method: 提出变分下界估计器，结合基于Transformer的策略网络和基于归一化流的变分后验进行优化。

Result: GO-CBED在多种因果推理和发现任务中优于现有基线，尤其是在实验预算有限和复杂因果机制下表现突出。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将实验设计目标与特定研究目标对齐以及前瞻性序列规划具有显著优势。

Abstract: We present GO-CBED, a goal-oriented Bayesian framework for sequential causal
experimental design. Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions
aimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the
expected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of
interest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework
is both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and
goal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To
address the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational
lower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy
network and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy
enables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that
GO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal
reasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and
semi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited
experimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the
benefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research
goals and of forward-looking sequential planning.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前基于图的疾病分类方法缺乏对队列特征的全面理解，且未能整合患者间的致病依赖性。

Method: 引入 ATHENA，通过分层网络表示和集成模态学习，优化患者特异性分子指纹，并与队列模式保持一致。

Conclusion: ATHENA 通过可解释 AI 驱动的子网络聚类，支持个性化干预策略，改善动脉粥样硬化疾病进展的预测和管理。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem pertaining to personalized classification
of subclinical atherosclerosis by developing a hierarchical graph neural
network framework to leverage two characteristic modalities of a patient:
clinical features within the context of the cohort, and molecular data unique
to individual patients. Current graph-based methods for disease classification
detect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and
comprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential
requirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse
atherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often
considers clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of
shared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these
challenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical
Explainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical
network representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it
optimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect
individual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a
primary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this
heterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction
patterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification
performance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver
operating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables
mechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI
(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework
strengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the
prediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their
clinical actionable outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 为了解决奖励模型在分布外（OOD）场景中的脆弱性，以及在多目标奖励函数中高质量数据不足导致的性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出了一种联合训练Bradley-Terry（BT）单目标和多目标回归奖励函数的统一框架，利用共享嵌入空间优化奖励模型。

Result: 实验表明，该框架显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和评分性能，7B模型表现优于70B基准。

Conclusion: 统一的奖励建模框架有效提升了奖励模型在OOD场景中的表现，并通过结合BT和回归任务优化了多目标奖励函数的性能。

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Abstract: Gaining a deeper understanding of the thickness and variability of internal

transformer for ice layer thickness. GRIT integrates an inductive geometric
graph learning framework with an attention mechanism, designed to map the
relationships between shallow and deeper ice layers. Compared to baseline graph
neural networks, GRIT demonstrates consistently lower prediction errors. These
results highlight the attention mechanism's effectiveness in capturing temporal
changes across ice layers, while the graph transformer combines the strengths
of transformers for learning long-range dependencies with graph neural networks
for capturing spatial patterns, enabling robust modeling of complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

Motivation: 罕见事件（如状态转换）因时间长而难以直接观测，现有机器学习方法虽能自动发现CV，但未完全编码动态细节。

Method: 提出TLC框架，通过学习时滞条件下的生成模型来直接获取CV，而非静态Boltzmann分布。

Result: 在阿尔二肽系统中，TLC在过渡路径采样和状态判别任务中表现优于现有MLCV方法。

Conclusion: TLC通过建模动态行为，显著提升了CV的准确性和采样效率。

Abstract: Rare events such as state transitions are difficult to observe directly with
molecular dynamics simulations due to long timescales. Enhanced sampling
techniques overcome this by introducing biases along carefully chosen
low-dimensional features, known as collective variables (CVs), which capture
the slow degrees of freedom. Machine learning approaches (MLCVs) have automated
CV discovery, but existing methods typically focus on discriminating
meta-stable states without fully encoding the detailed dynamics essential for
accurate sampling. We propose TLC, a framework that learns CVs directly from
time-lagged conditions of a generative model. Instead of modeling the static
Boltzmann distribution, TLC models a time-lagged conditional distribution
yielding CVs to capture the slow dynamic behavior. We validate TLC on the
Alanine Dipeptide system using two CV-based enhanced sampling tasks: (i)
steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and (ii) on-the-fly probability enhanced
sampling (OPES), demonstrating equal or superior performance compared to
existing MLCV methods in both transition path sampling and state
discrimination.

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet基准测试中，GTED在准确性和Kappa分数上优于所有基线指标。

Conclusion: GTED为自动形式化语句评估提供了更可靠的度量标准。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statement from
natural language into formal languages, has become a subject of extensive
research, yet the development of robust automated evaluation metrics remains
limited. Existing evaluation methods often lack semantic understanding, face
challenges with high computational costs, and are constrained by the current
progress of automated theorem proving. To address these issues, we propose GTED
(Generalized Tree Edit Distance), a novel evaluation framework that first
standardizes formal statements and converts them into operator trees, then
determines the semantic similarity using the eponymous GTED metric. On the
miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, GTED outperforms all baseline metrics by
achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa scores, thus providing the community
with a more faithful metric for automated evaluation. The code and experimental
results are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/GTED.

Conclusion: HGMP通过统一任务格式和优化预训练策略，有效解决了异质图任务中的不匹配问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The pre-training and fine-tuning methods have gained widespread attention in
the field of heterogeneous graph neural networks due to their ability to
leverage large amounts of unlabeled data during the pre-training phase,
allowing the model to learn rich structural features. However, these methods
face the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream
tasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.
Prompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph
tasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address
target inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel
multi-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.
First, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we
reformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,
we address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which
struggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous
graph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to
better leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance
model performance by refining the representation of input graph features.
Experimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts
well to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Result: 神经网络自然地表示了低维生成模型的信念，这种表示不受架构影响，且经典电路无法实现。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络通过预训练能够有效捕捉数据的潜在生成模型，表现出类似贝叶斯更新的行为。

Abstract: We show that deep neural networks, including transformers and RNNs,
pretrained as usual on next-token prediction, intrinsically discover and
represent beliefs over 'quantum' and 'post-quantum' low-dimensional generative
models of their training data -- as if performing iterative Bayesian updates
over the latent state of this world model during inference as they observe more
context. Notably, neural nets easily find these representation whereas there is
no finite classical circuit that would do the job. The corresponding geometric
relationships among neural activations induced by different input sequences are
found to be largely independent of neural-network architecture. Each point in
this geometry corresponds to a history-induced probability density over all
possible futures, and the relative displacement of these points reflects the
difference in mechanism and magnitude for how these distinct pasts affect the
future.

Abstract: Data-driven techniques have a large potential to transform and accelerate the
chemical sciences. However, chemical sciences also pose the unique challenge of
very diverse, small, fuzzy datasets that are difficult to leverage in
conventional machine learning approaches completely. A new class of models,
general-purpose models (GPMs) such as large language models, have shown the
ability to solve tasks they have not been directly trained on, and to flexibly
operate with low amounts of data in different formats. In this review, we
discuss fundamental building principles of GPMs and review recent applications
of those models in the chemical sciences across the entire scientific process.
While many of these applications are still in the prototype phase, we expect
that the increasing interest in GPMs will make many of them mature in the
coming years.

Result: 实验表明DTME-MTL在多任务学习中表现优异，计算开销小，且性能提升显著。

Conclusion: DTME-MTL为Transformer多任务学习提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

Result: CSP-LDA和MDRM-T能提供最佳不确定性估计，深度集成和标准CNN分类效果最好；所有模型均能区分简单与困难样本，提升BCI准确率。

Conclusion: 传统分类器在不确定性量化方面表现优异，结合样本筛选可优化BCI系统性能。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) turn brain signals into functionally useful
output, but they are not always accurate. A good Machine Learning classifier
should be able to indicate how confident it is about a given classification, by
giving a probability for its classification. Standard classifiers for Motor
Imagery BCIs do give such probabilities, but research on uncertainty
quantification has been limited to Deep Learning. We compare the uncertainty
quantification ability of established BCI classifiers using Common Spatial
Patterns (CSP-LDA) and Riemannian Geometry (MDRM) to specialized methods in
Deep Learning (Deep Ensembles and Direct Uncertainty Quantification) as well as
standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
  We found that the overconfidence typically seen in Deep Learning is not a
problem in CSP-LDA and MDRM. We found that MDRM is underconfident, which we
solved by adding Temperature Scaling (MDRM-T). CSP-LDA and MDRM-T give the best
uncertainty estimates, but Deep Ensembles and standard CNNs give the best
classifications. We show that all models are able to separate between easy and
difficult estimates, so that we can increase the accuracy of a Motor Imagery
BCI by rejecting samples that are ambiguous.

Motivation: PVGs尚未用于复杂输入（如高维图像），而CBMs虽能处理此类数据但受限于低容量线性预测器。NCV旨在结合两者优势。

Method: NCV利用概念发现模型提取结构化的概念编码，通过证明者选择子集，验证者（非线性预测器）仅用这些编码决策。

Result: NCV在高维且逻辑复杂的数据集上优于CBM和基于像素的PVG分类器，并能减少捷径行为。

Conclusion: NCV是迈向高性能、可验证AI的重要一步。

Abstract: While Prover-Verifier Games (PVGs) offer a promising path toward
verifiability in nonlinear classification models, they have not yet been
applied to complex inputs such as high-dimensional images. Conversely, Concept
Bottleneck Models (CBMs) effectively translate such data into interpretable
concepts but are limited by their reliance on low-capacity linear predictors.
In this work, we introduce the Neural Concept Verifier (NCV), a unified
framework combining PVGs with concept encodings for interpretable, nonlinear
classification in high-dimensional settings. NCV achieves this by utilizing
recent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured
concept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these
encodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses
exclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM
and pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex
datasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior. Overall, we demonstrate NCV
as a promising step toward performative, verifiable AI.

Motivation: 实时异常检测在工业互联网等领域需求激增，传统方法无法满足高维流数据的单次处理与低内存需求。

Method: 提出DAD方法，基于在线去相关学习动态监控数据相关性，支持单次处理与高效决策。

Result: 实验表明DAD在多种异常类型上表现一致优于现有方法，且对高维数据具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DAD在检测效果与计算效率间取得平衡，为实时内存受限场景设定了新标准。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world
domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns,
potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent
activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged
with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of
multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD
requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also
operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical
instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We
propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for
multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach.
Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that
process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors
the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling
efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking
practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy
tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on
widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most
consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing
dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time,
high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal
balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a
new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 新方法克服了现有技术的数值缺陷，提升了稳定性和适用范围。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Method: 提出了一种基于O-RAN范式的元学习框架，用于优化CHO过程，特别是在动态信号条件下。

Result: 在动态信号条件下，该方法比其他3GPP基准性能提升了至少180%，并具有鲁棒的动态后悔保证。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了条件切换的性能和效率，为解决现代移动网络中的切换问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Handovers (HOs) are the cornerstone of modern cellular networks for enabling
seamless connectivity to a vast and diverse number of mobile users. However, as
mobile networks become more complex with more diverse users and smaller cells,
traditional HOs face significant challenges, such as prolonged delays and
increased failures. To mitigate these issues, 3GPP introduced conditional
handovers (CHOs), a new type of HO that enables the preparation (i.e., resource
allocation) of multiple cells for a single user to increase the chance of HO
success and decrease the delays in the procedure. Despite its advantages, CHO
introduces new challenges that must be addressed, including efficient resource
allocation and managing signaling/communication overhead from frequent cell
preparations and releases. This paper presents a novel framework aligned with
the O-RAN paradigm that leverages meta-learning for CHO optimization, providing
robust dynamic regret guarantees and demonstrating at least 180% superior
performance than other 3GPP benchmarks in volatile signal conditions.

Result: 通过降维和专用轮廓方法显著提升了聚类算法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的聚类映射方法能够自动区分职业，为职业转换提供新途径。

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, face elevated occupational
stress, a concern amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. While wearable
sensors offer promising avenues for real-time stress monitoring, existing
studies often lack comprehensive datasets and robust analytical frameworks.
This study addresses these gaps by introducing a multimodal dataset comprising
physiological signals, electrodermal activity, heart rate and skin temperature.
A systematic literature review identified limitations in prior stress-detection
methodologies, particularly in handling class imbalance and optimizing model
generalizability. To overcome these challenges, the dataset underwent
preprocessing with the Synthetic Minority Over sampling Technique (SMOTE),
ensuring balanced representation of stress states. Advanced machine learning
models including Random Forest, XGBoost and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were
evaluated and combined into a Stacking Classifier to leverage their collective
predictive strengths. By using a publicly accessible dataset and a reproducible
analytical pipeline, this work advances the development of deployable
stress-monitoring systems, offering practical implications for safeguarding
healthcare workers' mental health. Future research directions include expanding
demographic diversity and exploring edge-computing implementations for low
latency stress alerts.

Result: 模型在多组数据中表现出高准确性，成功识别GBA调制中关键路径。

Conclusion: 研究展示了基于GBA调制的SMC系统在个性化医疗中的潜力，为未来开发更有效的治疗方法提供了理论和技术支持。

Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (SMC) is a key enabler for future
healthcare systems in which Internet of Bio-Nano-Things (IoBNT) devices
facilitate the continuous monitoring of a patient's biochemical signals. To
close the loop between sensing and actuation, both the detection and the
generation of in-body molecular communication (MC) signals is key. However,
generating signals inside the human body, e.g., via synthetic nanodevices,
poses a challenge in SMC, due to technological obstacles as well as legal,
safety, and ethical issues. Hence, this paper considers an SMC system in which
signals are generated indirectly via the modulation of a natural in-body MC
system, namely the gut-brain axis (GBA). Therapeutic GBA modulation is already
established as treatment for neurological diseases, e.g., drug refractory
epilepsy (DRE), and performed via the administration of nutritional supplements
or specific diets. However, the molecular signaling pathways that mediate the
effect of such treatments are mostly unknown. Consequently, existing treatments
are standardized or designed heuristically and able to help only some patients
while failing to help others. In this paper, we propose to leverage personal
health data, e.g., gathered by in-body IoBNT devices, to design more versatile
and robust GBA modulation-based treatments as compared to the existing ones. To
show the feasibility of our approach, we define a catalog of theoretical
requirements for therapeutic GBA modulation. Then, we propose a machine
learning model to verify these requirements for practical scenarios when only
limited data on the GBA modulation exists. By evaluating the proposed model on
several datasets, we confirm its excellent accuracy in identifying different
modulators of the GBA. Finally, we utilize the proposed model to identify
specific modulatory pathways that play an important role for therapeutic GBA
modulation.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，SLOGAN显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SLOGAN通过因果特征解耦和动态干预，实现了高效的图域适应。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) leverages labeled source domain
graphs to achieve effective performance in unlabeled target domains despite
distribution shifts. However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results
due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global
alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with
Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph
representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention
mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph
structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle
sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious
correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious
correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that
breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination
while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance
constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain
pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy,
ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习模型在高受试者间变异性下泛化能力不足的问题，提出更适合EEG数据的新架构。

Method: 设计了一种深度卷积tokenizer生成通道特定特征的token，增强self-attention层的特征混合能力。通过Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out交叉验证评估模型。

Result: TransformEEG在平衡准确率（中位数78.45%）和四分位距（6.37%）上表现最优，结合数据增强后准确率进一步提升至80.10%。

Conclusion: TransformEEG在降低结果偏差和提高一致性方面优于其他模型，为EEG数据帕金森病检测提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,
low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's
Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown
promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns
within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor
generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high
variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by
developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces
TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's
disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet
structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This
tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific
features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention
layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public
datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were
harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out
(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison
against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG
achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest
interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined
with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to
80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG
produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial
reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared
to the other investigated models.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning in sensitive domains demands scalable, privacy
preserving solutions for enterprise deployment. Conventional Federated Learning
(FL) relies on a central server, introducing single points of failure and
privacy risks, while Split Learning (SL) partitions models for privacy but
scales poorly due to sequential training. We present a decentralized
architecture that combines Federated Split Learning (FSL) with the permissioned
blockchain Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Our chaincode orchestrates FSL's split
model execution and peer-to-peer aggregation without any central coordinator,
leveraging HLF's transient fields and Private Data Collections (PDCs) to keep
raw data and model activations private. On CIFAR-10 and MNIST benchmarks,
HLF-FSL matches centralized FSL accuracy while reducing per epoch training time
compared to Ethereum-based works. Performance and scalability tests show
minimal blockchain overhead and preserved accuracy, demonstrating enterprise
grade viability.

Motivation: 探讨深度网络中随机ReLU层如何交替崩溃和部分恢复输入变异的子空间，以补充先前关于深度网络表达性的研究。

Method: 通过固定一批输入和随机高斯权重，推导隐藏激活矩阵的期望秩的闭式表达式，并分析了秩的几何衰减和振荡行为。

Result: 发现秩赤字以几何比1-2/π衰减，并在特定深度出现局部极大值（“复兴”深度），且这种现象在有限宽度下显著。

Conclusion: 随机ReLU层通过几何衰减和振荡行为交替影响输入变异子空间，这对理解深度网络的表达性提供了新视角。

Abstract: We analyze the layerwise effective dimension (rank of the feature matrix) in
fully-connected ReLU networks of finite width. Specifically, for a fixed batch
of $m$ inputs and random Gaussian weights, we derive closed-form expressions
for the expected rank of the \$m\times n\$ hidden activation matrices. Our main
result shows that $\mathbb{E}[EDim(\ell)]=m[1-(1-2/\pi)^\ell]+O(e^{-c m})$ so
that the rank deficit decays geometrically with ratio $1-2 / \pi \approx
0.3634$. We also prove a sub-Gaussian concentration bound, and identify the
"revival" depths at which the expected rank attains local maxima. In
particular, these peaks occur at depths
$\ell_k^*\approx(k+1/2)\pi/\log(1/\rho)$ with height $\approx (1-e^{-\pi/2}) m
\approx 0.79m$. We further show that this oscillatory rank behavior is a
finite-width phenomenon: under orthogonal weight initialization or strong
negative-slope leaky-ReLU, the rank remains (nearly) full. These results
provide a precise characterization of how random ReLU layers alternately
collapse and partially revive the subspace of input variations, adding nuance
to prior work on expressivity of deep networks.

Conclusion: FedCBDR通过全局协调和温度调整有效缓解了类不平衡问题，显著提升了联邦类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

Abstract: We propose a novel multi-task neural network approach for estimating
distributional treatment effects (DTE) in randomized experiments. While DTE
provides more granular insights into the experiment outcomes over conventional
methods focusing on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), estimating it with
regression adjustment methods presents significant challenges. Specifically,
precision in the distribution tails suffers due to data imbalance, and
computational inefficiencies arise from the need to solve numerous regression
problems, particularly in large-scale datasets commonly encountered in
industry. To address these limitations, our method leverages multi-task neural
networks to estimate conditional outcome distributions while incorporating
monotonic shape constraints and multi-threshold label learning to enhance
accuracy. To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our proposed method, we
apply our method to both simulated and real-world datasets, including a
randomized field experiment aimed at reducing water consumption in the US and a
large-scale A/B test from a leading streaming platform in Japan. The
experimental results consistently demonstrate superior performance across
various datasets, establishing our method as a robust and practical solution
for modern causal inference applications requiring a detailed understanding of
treatment effect heterogeneity.

Method: 提出“深度遗忘”的理论标准，基于数据特征表示的单点收缩，并设计了一种高效的近似算法OPC。

Result: 在图像分类基准测试中，OPC表现出色，不仅实现了有效的遗忘效果，还具备强大的抗攻击能力。

Conclusion: OPC通过其理论基础的深度特征遗忘，显著提升了机器遗忘方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to remove the influence of particular data or class
from trained models to meet privacy, legal, or ethical requirements. Existing
unlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model
pretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal
representations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data
or behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the
forgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance
recovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To
address this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of
``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations
of data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and
use it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:
One-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification
unlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning
performance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery
attack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of
OPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical
foundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning
methods.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

Result: 现有方法能在冲突目标间取得平衡，但特定环境变化下性能下降。

Conclusion: 需在策略学习中引入动态相关的上下文信息以提高泛化性。

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advancements in designing reinforcement
learning (RL)-based agents for building energy management. While individual
success is observed in simulated or controlled environments, the scalability of
RL approaches in terms of efficiency and generalization across building
dynamics and operational scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we
formally characterize the generalization space for the cross-environment,
multi-objective building energy management task, and formulate the
multi-objective contextual RL problem. Such a formulation helps understand the
challenges of transferring learned policies across varied operational contexts
such as climate and heat convection dynamics under multiple control objectives
such as comfort level and energy consumption. We provide a principled way to
parameterize such contextual information in realistic building RL environments,
and construct a novel benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of generalizable
RL algorithms in practical building control tasks. Our results show that
existing multi-objective RL methods are capable of achieving reasonable
trade-offs between conflicting objectives. However, their performance degrades
under certain environment variations, underscoring the importance of
incorporating dynamics-dependent contextual information into the policy
learning process.

Result: 在多种基准测试中，S4T优于现有TTT方法。

Conclusion: S4T通过任务同步策略有效提升了多任务场景下的域适应能力。

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

Result: 在著名的系统辨识基准测试中验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化技术能够有效改善状态空间中的数据分布，提升模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The state space dynamics representation is the most general approach for
nonlinear systems and often chosen for system identification. During training,
the state trajectory can deform significantly leading to poor data coverage of
the state space. This can cause significant issues for space-oriented training
algorithms which e.g. rely on grid structures, tree partitioning, or similar.
Besides hindering training, significant state trajectory deformations also
deteriorate interpretability and robustness properties. This paper proposes a
new type of space-filling regularization that ensures a favorable data
distribution in state space via introducing a data-distribution-based penalty.
This method is demonstrated in local model network architectures where good
interpretability is a major concern. The proposed approach integrates ideas
from modeling and design of experiments for state space structures. This is why
we present two regularization techniques for the data point distributions of
the state trajectories for local affine state space models. Beyond that, we
demonstrate the results on a widely known system identification benchmark.

Motivation: 生存预测在肿瘤学中至关重要，但传统方法依赖单一数据模态。为了应对这一挑战，研究开发了SAMVAE，旨在通过整合多模态数据提升预测能力。

Method: SAMVAE是一种新型变分自编码器架构，通过模态特定编码器将六种数据模态（临床变量、四种分子特征和病理图像）映射到共享潜在空间，支持标准生存分析和竞争风险场景。

Result: SAMVAE在两个癌症队列中表现出色，性能与最先进的多模态生存模型相当，首次在连续时间事件建模中整合了竞争风险。

Conclusion: SAMVAE为可解释的数据驱动生存分析奠定了基础，同时为临床决策提供了患者特异性见解。

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction is critical in oncology for prognosis and
treatment planning. Traditional approaches often rely on a single data
modality, limiting their ability to capture the complexity of tumor biology. To
address this challenge, we introduce a multimodal deep learning framework for
survival analysis capable of modeling both single and competing risks
scenarios, evaluating the impact of integrating multiple medical data sources
on survival predictions. We propose SAMVAE (Survival Analysis Multimodal
Variational Autoencoder), a novel deep learning architecture designed for
survival prediction that integrates six data modalities: clinical variables,
four molecular profiles, and histopathological images. SAMVAE leverages
modality specific encoders to project inputs into a shared latent space,
enabling robust survival prediction while preserving modality specific
information. Its parametric formulation enables the derivation of clinically
meaningful statistics from the output distributions, providing patient-specific
insights through interactive multimedia that contribute to more informed
clinical decision-making and establish a foundation for interpretable,
data-driven survival analysis in oncology. We evaluate SAMVAE on two cancer
cohorts breast cancer and lower grade glioma applying tailored preprocessing,
dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter optimization. The results
demonstrate the successful integration of multimodal data for both standard
survival analysis and competing risks scenarios across different datasets. Our
model achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art multimodal
survival models. Notably, this is the first parametric multimodal deep learning
architecture to incorporate competing risks while modeling continuous time to a
specific event, using both tabular and image data.

Result: 提出的Lipschitz界限更精确，且JaSMin能有效提升Transformer的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 新的Lipschitz界限揭示了注意力机制的内在性质，JaSMin为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present a novel local Lipschitz bound for self-attention blocks of
transformers. This bound is based on a refined closed-form expression for the
spectral norm of the softmax function. The resulting bound is not only more
accurate than in the prior art, but also unveils the dependence of the
Lipschitz constant on attention score maps. Based on the new findings, we
suggest an explanation of the way distributions inside the attention map affect
the robustness from the Lipschitz constant perspective. We also introduce a new
lightweight regularization term called JaSMin (Jacobian Softmax norm
Minimization), which boosts the transformer's robustness and decreases local
Lipschitz constants of the whole network.

achieving novel risk bounds. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to
illustrate the practical implications of these bounds in both contexts.

Abstract: Foundation models for tabular data are rapidly evolving, with increasing
interest in extending them to support additional modalities such as free-text
features. However, existing benchmarks for tabular data rarely include textual
columns, and identifying real-world tabular datasets with semantically rich
text features is non-trivial. We propose a series of simple yet effective
ablation-style strategies for incorporating text into conventional tabular
pipelines. Moreover, we benchmark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation
models can handle textual data by manually curating a collection of real-world
tabular datasets with meaningful textual features. Our study is an important
step towards improving benchmarking of foundation models for tabular data with
text.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) largely benefit from the
inclusion of Deep Neural Networks, boosting the number of novel approaches
proposed in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These techniques
demonstrate the ability to tackle complex games such as Atari, Go, and other
real-world applications, including financial trading. Nevertheless, a
significant challenge emerges from the lack of interpretability, particularly
when attempting to comprehend the underlying patterns learned, the relative
importance of the state features, and how they are integrated to generate the
policy's output. For this reason, in mission-critical and real-world settings,
it is often preferred to deploy a simpler and more interpretable algorithm,
although at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees, that can extract an
interpretable policy (e.g., a linear policy) without disregarding the
peculiarities of expert behavior. This result is obtained by considering the
advantage function, which includes information about why an action is superior
to the others. In contrast to previous works, our approach enables the training
of an interpretable policy using previously collected experience. The proposed
algorithm is empirically evaluated on classic control environments and on a
financial trading scenario, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful
information from complex expert policies.

Conclusion: 预训练模型的准确性对顺序决策任务具有重要价值，模型弹性可作为理解和改进预训练模型在数据驱动决策中集成的关键指标。

Abstract: We study a sequential contextual decision-making problem in which certain
covariates are missing but can be imputed using a pre-trained AI model. From a
theoretical perspective, we analyze how the presence of such a model influences
the regret of the decision-making process. We introduce a novel notion called
"model elasticity", which quantifies the sensitivity of the reward function to
the discrepancy between the true covariate and its imputed counterpart. This
concept provides a unified way to characterize the regret incurred due to model
imputation, regardless of the underlying missingness mechanism. More
surprisingly, we show that under the missing at random (MAR) setting, it is
possible to sequentially calibrate the pre-trained model using tools from
orthogonal statistical learning and doubly robust regression. This calibration
significantly improves the quality of the imputed covariates, leading to much
better regret guarantees. Our analysis highlights the practical value of having
an accurate pre-trained model in sequential decision-making tasks and suggests
that model elasticity may serve as a fundamental metric for understanding and
improving the integration of pre-trained models in a wide range of data-driven
decision-making problems.

Conclusion: 平方根参数化方法为解决自然梯度变分推断的理论收敛性问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Variational inference with natural-gradient descent often shows fast
convergence in practice, but its theoretical convergence guarantees have been
challenging to establish. This is true even for the simplest cases that involve
concave log-likelihoods and use a Gaussian approximation. We show that the
challenge can be circumvented for such cases using a square-root
parameterization for the Gaussian covariance. This approach establishes novel
convergence guarantees for natural-gradient variational-Gaussian inference and
its continuous-time gradient flow. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of natural gradient methods and highlight their advantages over
algorithms that use Euclidean or Wasserstein geometries.

Conclusion: DPO的理论框架为实际应用提供了重要指导，并有助于规避潜在陷阱。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very
specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of
learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice
(Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of
Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for
abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex
objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable
extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length.
Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is
crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models,
because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly --
because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small
region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of
departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating and outpacing current antibiotic
development. Thus, discovering antibiotics effective against emerging pathogens
is becoming increasingly critical. However, existing approaches cannot rapidly
identify effective molecules against novel pathogens or emerging drug-resistant
strains. Here, we introduce ApexOracle, an artificial intelligence (AI) model
that both predicts the antibacterial potency of existing compounds and designs
de novo molecules active against strains it has never encountered. Departing
from models that rely solely on molecular features, ApexOracle incorporates
pathogen-specific context through the integration of molecular features
captured via a foundational discrete diffusion language model and a
dual-embedding framework that combines genomic- and literature-derived strain
representations. Across diverse bacterial species and chemical modalities,
ApexOracle consistently outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in activity
prediction and demonstrated reliable transferability to novel pathogens with
little or no antimicrobial data. Its unified representation-generation
architecture further enables the in silico creation of "new-to-nature"
molecules with high predicted efficacy against priority threats. By pairing
rapid activity prediction with targeted molecular generation, ApexOracle offers
a scalable strategy for countering AMR and preparing for future
infectious-disease outbreaks.

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）存在任务冲突问题，限制了模型性能。研究探讨了如何利用Sharpness-aware minimization（SAM）缓解任务冲突。

Result: 在多个多任务基准测试中验证了SAMO的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SAMO成功解决了任务冲突问题，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables a joint model to capture commonalities
across multiple tasks, reducing computation costs and improving data
efficiency. However, a major challenge in MTL optimization is task conflicts,
where the task gradients differ in direction or magnitude, limiting model
performance compared to single-task counterparts. Sharpness-aware minimization
(SAM) minimizes task loss while simultaneously reducing the sharpness of the
loss landscape. Our empirical observations show that SAM effectively mitigates
task conflicts in MTL. Motivated by these findings, we explore integrating SAM
into MTL but face two key challenges. While both the average loss gradient and
individual task gradients-referred to as global and local
information-contribute to SAM, how to combine them remains unclear. Moreover,
directly computing each task gradient introduces significant computational and
memory overheads. To address these challenges, we propose SAMO, a lightweight
\textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}ulti-task \textbf{O}ptimization
approach, that leverages a joint global-local perturbation. The local
perturbations are approximated using only forward passes and are layerwise
normalized to improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on a suite of
multi-task benchmarks demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our
method. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/SAMO.

Result: 在MSP430上实现11.02%至82.03%的MAC减少，推理速度提升27.30%至84.19%，能耗降低27.33%至84.38%。

Conclusion: UnIT在微控制器上实现了高效、无需重新训练的神经网络部署。

Abstract: Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile
time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power
microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for
fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To
address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time
pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips
unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by
input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces
irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.
It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing
multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further
optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections
and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three
fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of
common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT
achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and
27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned
models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT
matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring
significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time
pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free
deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.

into a hierarchical ontology, and establish relationships between new and
existing topics through a topic ontology. We demonstrate the use of extracted
topics to infer company-level insights and emerging trends over time. We
evaluate our approach by measuring ontology coherence, topic evolution
accuracy, and its ability to surface emerging financial trends.

Motivation: 生成模型（如扩散模型）的隐私和版权问题日益突出，已有研究通过高资源方法重建训练数据，但缺乏对低资源条件下潜在风险的探讨。

Method: 提出一种新攻击方法，利用领域知识和电商平台数据的模板化特点，设计特定提示词以重建图像。

Result: 实验表明，如提示词“蓝色Unisex T-Shirt”可重建真人面部图像，显示即使无恶意用户也可能无意中泄露数据。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了生成模型的固有漏洞，强调了数据采集和使用过程中模板化提示的风险。

Abstract: The recent advances in generative models such as diffusion models have raised
several risks and concerns related to privacy, copyright infringements and data
stewardship. To better understand and control the risks, various researchers
have created techniques, experiments and attacks that reconstruct images, or
part of images, from the training set. While these techniques already establish
that data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on
high-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and
designed prompts.
  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes
little to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,
benign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This
highlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed
user and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one
existing model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a
real-life human model. Our method builds on an intuition from previous works
which leverages domain knowledge and identifies a fundamental vulnerability
that stems from the use of scraped data from e-commerce platforms, where
templated layouts and images are tied to pattern-like prompts.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 尽管近年来语言模型（LMs）取得了巨大进展，但预处理步骤（如分词）仍然是实现真正端到端基础模型的障碍。研究旨在通过动态分块机制消除这一障碍。

Method: 引入动态分块机制，结合层次网络（H-Net）实现端到端学习。H-Net通过多级层次结构建模不同抽象级别，无需显式监督即可学习数据依赖的分块策略。

Result: H-Net在计算和数据匹配的情况下，性能优于基于BPE分词的Transformer模型；多级层次结构进一步提升了性能，尤其在中文和代码等任务中表现出更高的数据效率（近4倍提升）。

Conclusion: H-Net展示了从原始数据中学习并扩展的真正端到端模型的潜力，尤其在分词启发式较弱的多语言和多模态任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite incredible progress in language models (LMs) in recent years, largely
resulting from moving away from specialized models designed for specific tasks
to general models based on powerful architectures (e.g. the Transformer) that
learn everything from raw data, pre-processing steps such as tokenization
remain a barrier to true end-to-end foundation models. We introduce a
collection of new techniques that enable a dynamic chunking mechanism which
automatically learns content -- and context -- dependent segmentation
strategies learned jointly with the rest of the model. Incorporating this into
an explicit hierarchical network (H-Net) allows replacing the (implicitly
hierarchical) tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single model
learned fully end-to-end. When compute- and data- matched, an H-Net with one
stage of hierarchy operating at the byte level outperforms a strong Transformer
language model operating over BPE tokens. Iterating the hierarchy to multiple
stages further increases its performance by modeling multiple levels of
abstraction, demonstrating significantly better scaling with data and matching
a token-based Transformer of twice its size. H-Nets pretrained on English show
significantly increased character-level robustness, and qualitatively learn
meaningful data-dependent chunking strategies without any heuristics or
explicit supervision. Finally, the H-Net's improvement over tokenized pipelines
is further increased in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization
heuristics, such as Chinese and code, or DNA sequences (nearly 4x improvement
in data efficiency over baselines), showing the potential of true end-to-end
models that learn and scale better from unprocessed data.

Abstract: In most real-world applications of artificial intelligence, the distributions
of the data and the goals of the learners tend to change over time. The
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework, which underpins most
machine learning algorithms, fails to account for dynamic data distributions
and evolving objectives, often resulting in suboptimal performance. Prospective
learning is a recently introduced mathematical framework that overcomes some of
these limitations. We build on this framework to present preliminary results
that improve the algorithm and numerical results, and extend prospective
learning to sequential decision-making scenarios, specifically foraging. Code

Result: 实验表明，Q-chunking在离线性能和在线样本效率上表现出色，优于以往最佳方法。

Conclusion: Q-chunking为长时程、稀疏奖励任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks.
Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is
to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of
online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain
central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data
should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is
that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where
sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each
timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to
mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by
directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)
leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective
online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and
efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking
exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming
prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward
manipulation tasks.

Result: 在微调预训练策略和利用离线数据训练时，样本效率平均提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: EXPO通过稳定优化和动态动作选择，显著提升了表达性策略的训练效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of training and fine-tuning expressive policies with
online reinforcement learning (RL) given an offline dataset. Training
expressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable
value maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online
RL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are
parameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient
propagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some
value function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value
maximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive
policy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We
propose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL
algorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two
parameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable
imitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits
the actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.
The on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the
learned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and
edited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our
approach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over
prior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given
offline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.

Motivation: 探索预训练神经网络是否能在不微调的情况下根据输入动态调整架构，以及是否需要所有层来处理不同复杂度的任务。

Method: 通过跳过或重复层的方法构建链式层（CoLa），并利用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）找到每个样本的最优层组合。

Result: 对于75%的正确预测样本，可以找到更短的CoLa提升效率；对于60%的错误预测样本，可以找到能正确预测的CoLa。

Conclusion: 固定架构的LLMs在推理中存在局限性，动态调整层结构可显著提升模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs
without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they
adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large
language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better
and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each
layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple
times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary
orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space
greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained
modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample
from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a
fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same
layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic
architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the
MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples
with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa,
suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of
samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving
correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our
results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained
LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the
generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.

Conclusion: LLMs通过结构化反馈和模块化代理，能够统一高级符号规划和低级连续控制，为化学工程中的弹性、语言驱动自动化开辟了道路。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with
workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation
paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we
introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control
within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as
interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes
recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each
transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.
In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25
states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path
success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy
and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs
on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target
average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to
classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,
while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling
nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following
lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with
structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic
planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient,
language-driven automation in chemical engineering.

Result: 在KaoKore和PACS数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提出了新指标SODC衡量偏差减少效果，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BOOST能显著减少类别偏差，同时保持高性能，为艺术领域的AI去偏提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The pervasive issue of bias in AI presents a significant challenge to
painting classification, and is getting more serious as these systems become
increasingly integrated into tasks like art curation and restoration. Biases,
often arising from imbalanced datasets where certain artistic styles dominate,
compromise the fairness and accuracy of model predictions, i.e., classifiers
are less accurate on rarely seen paintings. While prior research has made
strides in improving classification performance, it has largely overlooked the
critical need to address these underlying biases, that is, when dealing with
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our insight highlights the necessity of a more
robust approach to bias mitigation in AI models for art classification on
biased training data. We propose a novel OOD-informed model bias adaptive
sampling method called BOOST (Bias-Oriented OOD Sampling and Tuning). It
addresses these challenges by dynamically adjusting temperature scaling and
sampling probabilities, thereby promoting a more equitable representation of
all classes. We evaluate our proposed approach to the KaoKore and PACS
datasets, focusing on the model's ability to reduce class-wise bias. We further
propose a new metric, Same-Dataset OOD Detection Score (SODC), designed to
assess class-wise separation and per-class bias reduction. Our method
demonstrates the ability to balance high performance with fairness, making it a
robust solution for unbiasing AI models in the art domain.

Conclusion: 神经符号方法和问题树查询技术为在复杂供应链中检测非法活动提供了新的解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺的情况下显示出潜力。

Abstract: Supply chain networks are complex systems that are challenging to analyze;
this problem is exacerbated when there are illicit activities involved in the
supply chain, such as counterfeit parts, forced labor, or human trafficking.
While machine learning (ML) can find patterns in complex systems like supply
chains, traditional ML techniques require large training data sets. However,
illicit supply chains are characterized by very sparse data, and the data that
is available is often (purposely) corrupted or unreliable in order to hide the
nature of the activities. We need to be able to automatically detect new
patterns that correlate with such illegal activity over complex, even temporal
data, without requiring large training data sets. We explore neurosymbolic
methods for identifying instances of illicit activity in supply chains and
compare the effectiveness of manual and automated feature extraction from news
articles accurately describing illicit activities uncovered by authorities. We
propose a question tree approach for querying a large language model (LLM) to
identify and quantify the relevance of articles. This enables a systematic
evaluation of the differences between human and machine classification of news
articles related to forced labor in supply chains.

Abstract: Efficient exploration is a well known problem in deep reinforcement learning
and this problem is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning due the
intrinsic complexities of such algorithms. There are several approaches to
efficiently explore an environment to learn to solve tasks by multi-agent
operating in that environment, of which, the idea of expert exploration is
investigated in this work. More specifically, this work investigates the
application of large-language models as expert planners for efficient
exploration in planning based tasks for multiple agents.

Key words: 多模态翻译, LLM, 字幕生成, 视觉上下文, 记忆系统

TL;DR: ViDove是一个基于LLM的多模态翻译系统，通过整合视觉和上下文背景信息提升了翻译质量，并在字幕生成和翻译任务中表现优异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有LLM翻译代理通常仅支持文本输入，缺乏对多模态信息的利用，限制了翻译能力。

Method: ViDove结合视觉和上下文信息，采用多模态记忆系统及长短时记忆模块，提升翻译准确性和适应性。

Result: ViDove在BLEU分数和SubER指标上分别提升28%和15%，并发布了DoveBench基准数据集。

Conclusion: ViDove通过多模态输入显著提升了翻译质量，为实际应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

Key words: 大型语言模型，安全性，过滤，计算复杂性，对齐

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型(LLM)的安全性挑战，指出外部过滤方法(输入和输出过滤)在计算上存在不可行性，并强调安全设计需与模型内部结合。

Motivation: 随着LLM的广泛应用，防止其生成有害内容是关键问题。

Method: 分析输入和输出过滤的计算复杂性，证明其效率限制。

Result: 发现输入和输出过滤在特定条件下均计算不可行。

Conclusion: 安全设计需集成到LLM内部，无法依赖外部黑盒过滤。

Abstract: With the increased deployment of large language models (LLMs), one concern is
their potential misuse for generating harmful content. Our work studies the
alignment challenge, with a focus on filters to prevent the generation of
unsafe information. Two natural points of intervention are the filtering of the
input prompt before it reaches the model, and filtering the output after
generation. Our main results demonstrate computational challenges in filtering
both prompts and outputs. First, we show that there exist LLMs for which there
are no efficient prompt filters: adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
behavior can be easily constructed, which are computationally indistinguishable
from benign prompts for any efficient filter. Our second main result identifies
a natural setting in which output filtering is computationally intractable. All
of our separation results are under cryptographic hardness assumptions. In
addition to these core findings, we also formalize and study relaxed mitigation
approaches, demonstrating further computational barriers. We conclude that
safety cannot be achieved by designing filters external to the LLM internals
(architecture and weights); in particular, black-box access to the LLM will not
suffice. Based on our technical results, we argue that an aligned AI system's
intelligence cannot be separated from its judgment.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 供应链运输中的高响应性和经济效率是关键目标，而运输模式的选择直接影响这两者。为此，需要一个整合模拟与智能决策的框架以设计低风险的运输策略。

Method: Sim-to-Dec框架包括一个生成模拟模块（利用自回归模型模拟连续状态变化）和一个历史-未来双感知决策模型，通过端到端优化与模拟交互迭代优化。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，Sim-to-Dec显著提高了及时交付率和利润。

Conclusion: Sim-to-Dec在通用性、动态性、历史与预测融合及模拟-策略紧耦合方面表现优异，为供应链运输策略设计提供了有效工具。

Abstract: High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply
chain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on
shipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an
intelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk
environment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision
framework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect
fine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with
predictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation
feedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy
these requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative
simulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate
continuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific
rules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future
dual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization
with simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely
delivery rates and profit.

Method: DrugMCTS 整合了 RAG、多智能体协作和蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用五个专业智能体检索和分析分子与蛋白质信息，支持结构化迭代推理。

Result: DrugMCTS 在 DrugBank 和 KIBA 数据集上表现出高召回率和鲁棒性，优于通用大语言模型和深度学习基线模型，性能提升超过 20%。

Conclusion: 结构化推理、智能体协作和反馈驱动的搜索机制对大语言模型在药物发现中的应用至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated considerable
potential in scientific domains such as drug discovery. However, their
effectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge
acquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or
retrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high
computational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.
To overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that
synergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree
Search for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents
tasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby
enabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific
fine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by
over 20\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate
that DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to
both general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines. Our results highlight
the importance of structured reasoning, agent-based collaboration, and
feedback-driven search mechanisms in advancing LLM applications for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有的基准测试很少同时评估生产力活动和社交互动能力，StarDojo旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了包含1000项任务的基准测试，覆盖五大领域，并提供100项代表性任务的子集用于高效评估。提供了一个统一的用户友好界面，支持多平台和多实例并行执行。

Result: 现有最先进的MLLM智能体表现有限，GPT-4.1的成功率仅为12.7%，主要因视觉理解、多模态推理和底层操作挑战。

Conclusion: StarDojo为复杂生产生活环境中开放式智能体的进一步研究提供了便捷工具。

Abstract: Autonomous agents navigating human society must master both production
activities and social interactions, yet existing benchmarks rarely evaluate
these skills simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce StarDojo, a novel
benchmark based on Stardew Valley, designed to assess AI agents in open-ended
production-living simulations. In StarDojo, agents are tasked to perform
essential livelihood activities such as farming and crafting, while
simultaneously engaging in social interactions to establish relationships
within a vibrant community. StarDojo features 1,000 meticulously curated tasks
across five key domains: farming, crafting, exploration, combat, and social
interactions. Additionally, we provide a compact subset of 100 representative
tasks for efficient model evaluation. The benchmark offers a unified,
user-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse
control, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel
execution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited
for evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents
demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,
achieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual
understanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation. As a
user-friendly environment and benchmark, StarDojo aims to facilitate further
research towards robust, open-ended agents in complex production-living
environments.

Conclusion: 系统评估LLM任务解决算法为资源密集型扩展提供了替代方案，促进对底层计算的理解。

Abstract: What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies
addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on
improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in
understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a
framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.
AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent
representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic
composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential
methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent
search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down
hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses
via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The
rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an
alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a
principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic
explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling
comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can
in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving
performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent
systems.

Motivation: 解释机器学习模型的预测对高风险领域至关重要，而错误的解释会误导人类决策者。基于规则的ML模型虽然被广泛使用，但仍存在一些不良特征。

Method: 论文开发了算法来分析基于规则的ML模型中可能出现的负面特征，如重叠和冗余。

Result: 研究发现，广泛使用的基于规则的ML模型工具会导致规则集中出现一个或多个负面特征。

Conclusion: 基于规则的ML模型在高风险应用中需要更严格的解释和分析工具，以减少不良特征的影响。

Abstract: A task of interest in machine learning (ML) is that of ascribing explanations
to the predictions made by ML models. Furthermore, in domains deemed high risk,
the rigor of explanations is paramount. Indeed, incorrect explanations can and
will mislead human decision makers. As a result, and even if interpretability
is acknowledged as an elusive concept, so-called interpretable models are
employed ubiquitously in high-risk uses of ML and data mining (DM). This is the
case for rule-based ML models, which encompass decision trees, diagrams, sets
and lists. This paper relates explanations with well-known undesired facets of
rule-based ML models, which include negative overlap and several forms of
redundancy. The paper develops algorithms for the analysis of these undesired
facets of rule-based systems, and concludes that well-known and widely used
tools for learning rule-based ML models will induce rule sets that exhibit one
or more negative facets.

Motivation: 现有GNN模型在知识图谱链接预测中，普通聚合方法对性能提升不明显，因此需要更有效的方法来增强模型表现。

Method: 提出Context Pooling方法，首次在知识图谱中应用图池化，并设计邻居精度和邻居召回率指标来选择逻辑相关邻居。

Result: 在两个SOTA模型和三个公共数据集上测试，在42/48的设置中达到了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Context Pooling是一种通用且高效的方法，显著提升了GNN在知识图谱链接预测中的表现。

Abstract: Recent investigations on the effectiveness of Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based models for link prediction in Knowledge Graphs (KGs) show that
vanilla aggregation does not significantly impact the model performance. In
this paper, we introduce a novel method, named Context Pooling, to enhance
GNN-based models' efficacy for link predictions in KGs. To our best of
knowledge, Context Pooling is the first methodology that applies graph pooling
in KGs. Additionally, Context Pooling is first-of-its-kind to enable the
generation of query-specific graphs for inductive settings, where testing
entities are unseen during training. Specifically, we devise two metrics,
namely neighborhood precision and neighborhood recall, to assess the neighbors'
logical relevance regarding the given queries, thereby enabling the subsequent
comprehensive identification of only the logically relevant neighbors for link
prediction. Our method is generic and assessed by being applied to two
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on three public transductive and inductive
datasets, achieving SOTA performance in 42 out of 48 settings.

Conclusion: PlanQA揭示了当前大语言模型在真实世界布局推理中的盲点，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: We introduce PlanQA, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating geometric and
spatial reasoning in large-language models (LLMs). PlanQA is grounded in
structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms,
and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The
benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and
topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also
interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and
usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial
LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to
simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under
layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they
do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this
benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and
manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了推理准确性和对齐效果，优于标准DPO。

Conclusion: 稳定偏好优化为偏好对齐目标的设计提供了新思路，并为语言模型对齐的可靠性和可解释性开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a popular and efficient
alternative to reward modeling and reinforcement learning for aligning language
models with human preferences. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
properties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,
we first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability
evolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to
initialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can
inadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This
misallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising
both the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended
preferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a
theoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate
supervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference
optimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to
explicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,
while maintaining stable optimization dynamics. Experiments on challenging
reasoning and summarization benchmarks elucidate that our method consistently
improves reasoning accuracy and better aligns output distributions with
intended preferences, outperforming standard DPO. Stable preference
optimization provides new insights into the design of preference-based
alignment objectives and opens up new avenues towards more reliable and
interpretable language model alignment.

Abstract: The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200
years, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to
experiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.
Around 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for
orchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were
then reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on
several characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.
lines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced
instruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by
experts, they have not been studied quantitatively.
  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or
non-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments
whose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each
instrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.
Each line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y
= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)
and how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional
features from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values
fall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of
levels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.
  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can
predict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non
reduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a
whole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more
difficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to
be the most predictive.

Motivation: 傳統AI評估專注於技術能力或避免傷害，FAI Benchmark則關注AI如何全面支持人類繁榮。

Method: 通過1,229個客觀和主觀問題，並使用專門的LLM評分模型和幾何平均評分，評估AI在七個維度的表現。

Result: 28個領先語言模型的測試顯示，部分模型在某些維度表現較好（最高72/100），但在信仰、品德和意義等維度仍不足。

Conclusion: FAI Benchmark為開發支持人類繁榮的AI系統提供了框架，對AI發展和倫理具有重要意義。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Flourishing AI Benchmark (FAI Benchmark), a novel
evaluation framework that assesses AI alignment with human flourishing across
seven dimensions: Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness
and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health,
Financial and Material Stability, and Faith and Spirituality. Unlike
traditional benchmarks that focus on technical capabilities or harm prevention,
the FAI Benchmark measures AI performance on how effectively models contribute
to the flourishing of a person across these dimensions. The benchmark evaluates
how effectively LLM AI systems align with current research models of holistic
human well-being through a comprehensive methodology that incorporates 1,229
objective and subjective questions. Using specialized judge Large Language
Models (LLMs) and cross-dimensional evaluation, the FAI Benchmark employs
geometric mean scoring to ensure balanced performance across all flourishing
dimensions. Initial testing of 28 leading language models reveals that while
some models approach holistic alignment (with the highest-scoring models

Key words: 大语言模型, 视觉语言模型, 混合专家, 自动驾驶, 技能导向

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MoSE的技能导向混合专家模型，模拟人类驾驶员的学习过程，通过技能导向路由和分层数据实现高性能自动驾驶。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有MoE模型需要大量数据和复杂优化，而人类驾驶员的学习过程更具效率，因此提出模仿人类学习过程的技能导向MoE。

Method: 提出技能导向路由机制，定义并标注特定技能，构建分层技能数据集，预训练路由器以实现逐步推理。

Result: MoSE在CODA AD任务中超越多个8B+参数模型，激活模型尺寸至少减少62.5%。

Conclusion: MoSE通过技能导向学习和单次前向推理，实现了高性能和小尺寸的自动驾驶模型。

Abstract: Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models
(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving
systems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by
dynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve
substantial performance improvements while maintaining computational
efficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data
and complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of
human drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human
drivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and
step-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with
defining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the
necessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,
thereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process
to multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we
build a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the
model to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates
valuable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single
forward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less
than 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+
parameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods
based on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by
$62.5\%$) with a single-turn conversation.

TL;DR: 提出自适应传感作为AI可持续性发展的关键转变，通过动态调整传感器参数提升效率和小模型的性能。

<details>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 当前AI依赖模型和数据规模的扩大，导致环境、经济和伦理成本高昂，限制了可持续性和公平性。

Method: 借鉴生物感官系统，提出动态调整传感器参数（如曝光度、灵敏度）的自适应传感方法。

Result: 研究表明，自适应传感能使小模型（如EfficientNet-B0）性能超越大模型（如OpenCLIP-H）。

Conclusion: 呼吁推动自适应传感在实际应用中的集成，以实现可持续且公平的AI系统。

Abstract: Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding
training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable
successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and
ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by
biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input
(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive
sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively
modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal
configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts
and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates
that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass
substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more
data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive
sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous
systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess
technical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted
research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive
algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.
Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward
sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 尽管因果关系在提升机器学习模型的性能、可靠性和可解释性方面表现出色，但现有的可解释人工智能（XAI）和因果文献未能满足非专业用户的需求，他们更关注导致目标结果的实际原因。然而，识别实际原因是一个NP完全问题，且缺乏实用的解决方案。

Method: 作者提出了一组算法，这些算法能够在多项式复杂度下识别实际原因，并支持通过调整计算时间来平衡精确性和全面性。

Result: 实验表明，该算法能够处理现有方法无法覆盖的非布尔、黑盒和随机系统，并且可以通过调整计算时间获得更高的精确性和全面性。

Conclusion: 该算法为解决实际原因的识别问题提供了高效的解决方案，填补了现有方法的空白，并具有较高的灵活性。

Abstract: Causality has gained popularity in recent years. It has helped improve the
performance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.
However, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has
faced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on
understanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such
knowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert
users expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause
the target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still
an open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an
NP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate
formal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes
with a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and
exhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify
causes for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing
approaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be
adjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has positioned large
language models as fundamental components of intelligent legal systems.
However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis,
including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept
understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced
framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge
graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure
comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance,
supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization
mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with
legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four
complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm
code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path
reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate
with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for
legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance
improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application
analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial
decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing
intelligent legal assistance systems.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 探讨AI模型因计算资源投入的边际收益递减而导致的能力趋同现象，挑战现有关于AI性能差异将持续的直觉。

Method: 1. 提出一个模型，说明在固定分布的下一个token目标下，计算资源的边际收益显著减少。2. 分析基准数据和理论性能模型，证明训练损失差异等代理指标能有效衡量能力。3. 通过历史数据分析AI模型能力差异的变化。

Result: 计算资源投入的边际收益递减将导致弱小模型的能力接近高性能模型，从而削弱资源丰富的公司在AI能力上的优势。

Conclusion: AI能力的趋同现象要求对AI战略和政策进行重新评估，以适应这一变化带来的影响。

Abstract: The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies,
leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary
to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead
to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those
with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the
performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating
that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability
returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,
we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies
that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will
eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we
give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture
important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and
theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the
capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the
increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require
reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.

Method: 通过分析20万条用户与Microsoft Bing Copilot的匿名对话数据，研究AI辅助的工作活动及其成功率和影响范围，并结合职业数据计算AI适用性得分。

Result: AI最常辅助的活动是信息收集和写作，而其自身最常执行的活动是提供信息、写作、教学和建议。知识密集型职业（如计算机和数学相关职业）的AI适用性得分最高。

Conclusion: AI在知识密集型职业中的应用潜力巨大，尤其是在信息处理和沟通领域。

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide
range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of
society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that
goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what
occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a
publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work
activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and
writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are
providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising.
Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and
scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We
find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups
such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as
well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and
communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with
AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of
occupational AI impact.

Abstract: Flooding remains a major global challenge, worsened by climate change and
urbanization, demanding advanced solutions for effective disaster management.
While traditional 2D flood mapping techniques provide limited insights, 3D
flood mapping, powered by deep learning (DL), offers enhanced capabilities by
integrating flood extent and depth. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of deep learning-based 3D flood mapping, emphasizing its advancements over 2D
maps by integrating flood extent and depth for effective disaster management
and urban planning. The survey categorizes deep learning techniques into task
decomposition and end-to-end approaches, applicable to both static and dynamic
flood features. We compare key DL architectures, highlighting their respective
roles in enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.
Additionally, this work explores diverse data sources such as digital elevation
models, satellite imagery, rainfall, and simulated data, outlining their roles
in 3D flood mapping. The applications reviewed range from real-time flood
prediction to long-term urban planning and risk assessment. However,
significant challenges persist, including data scarcity, model
interpretability, and integration with traditional hydrodynamic models. This
survey concludes by suggesting future directions to address these limitations,
focusing on enhanced datasets, improved models, and policy implications for
flood management. This survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DL techniques for more robust and reliable 3D flood mapping,
fostering improved flood management strategies.

Conclusion: MMoE有效解决MEL中关键问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

Result: 强化学习方法在减少幻觉方面表现最佳，监督微调方法表现出稳定性能。

Conclusion: 模态冲突是诱发MLLMs幻觉的关键因素，三种方法均能有效缓解，为模型鲁棒性研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 在GNSS不可用的环境中，自主海上监视和目标识别对搜救和威胁检测等应用至关重要，尤其是当目标仅通过视觉线索描述且位置未知时，UAV需依赖机载视觉在计算资源受限下扫描大范围区域。

Method: 利用YOLOv8模型检测视野中的船只，结合特征匹配和色调直方距离分析判断是否为目标船只，发现后通过简单几何原理定位目标。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在GNSS不可用环境下能有效识别和定位目标船只，并分析了视角对性能的影响。

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

Conclusion: LinguaMark为多语言多模态模型评估提供了标准化工具，推动了进一步研究和可重复性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

Result: 通过实验和定量分析验证了所提模型的优越性，并引入了一个新的数据集DeformingThings4D-skl。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了跨类别动物运动迁移，同时保留了物种特有的行为习惯。

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

Motivation: 目前多模态大语言模型在空间可视化能力上缺乏专门的评估，现有评估方法可能因训练数据的重叠而不可靠。因此，需要开发一个独立且全面的评估基准。

Method: 通过设计SpatialViz-Bench基准，包含12个任务和4个子能力类别，共计1180个自动生成的问题，用于评估33种先进多模态大语言模型的空间可视化能力。

Result: 评估结果显示模型性能差异大，且存在与人类直觉不符的困难感知、2D到3D的性能骤降以及过度依赖公式推导等问题。

Conclusion: SpatialViz-Bench揭示了现有模型在空间可视化任务中的不足，填补了这一领域的空白，并提供了公开可用的基准。

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决长视频推理中的独特挑战，提升视觉语言模型在长视频中的表现。

Method: 结合大规模数据集LongVideo-Reason、两阶段训练管道（CoT-SFT和RL）以及多模态强化序列并行（MR-SP）基础设施。

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B在长视频QA基准测试中表现优异，MR-SP系统实现2.1倍加速，且支持单节点A100（8 GPUs）上进行长达一小时视频的RL训练。

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1标志着VLMs在长视频推理中的显著进步，并公开支持多模态和模型类型的训练系统。

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 当前缺乏全面评估视觉基础推理能力的基准测试，因此提出TreeBench填补这一空白。

Method: 基于三个原则构建TreeBench基准测试，并开发TreeVGR训练范式，结合强化学习监督定位和推理。

Result: TreeBench包含405个挑战性问题，最先进模型准确率低于60%。TreeVGR显著提升了多个基准测试的表现。

Conclusion: 跟踪证据是提升视觉基础推理能力的关键，TreeBench和TreeVGR为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

Motivation: 黑色素瘤是一种致命的皮肤癌，蓝白色面纱（BWV）是其诊断关键特征，但相关研究不足。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提供高效的BWV检测方法。

Method: 使用未标注的皮肤病变数据集，通过颜色阈值技术和自定义DCNN层进行数据增强和训练，并结合XAI算法解释模型决策。

Result: 模型在不同数据集上的测试准确率分别为85.71%（PH2）、95.00%（ISIC）、95.05%（PH2+ISIC）和90.00%（Derm7pt），表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该研究通过改进的DCNN和XAI技术显著提升了BWV检测能力，为早期黑色素瘤诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

Motivation: 安全敏感应用如自动驾驶需精确的OoD分割，现有方法存在边界不精确、对象内异常评分不一致和背景噪声导致的误报。

Method: 分三阶段：粗粒度异常评分（CAS）、对象感知评分校准（OASC）和精细边界处理（MBP）。

Result: 在多个OoD分割基准测试中达到最先进水平，如像素级AuPRC提升至96.99，组件级F1得分提升至83.44。

Conclusion: Objectomaly通过对象级先验和边界优化显著提升了OoD分割性能，适用于实际驾驶场景。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon

framework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on
vision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges
in industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection
mechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:
(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features

Result: RED在多基准测试和不同模型中显著优于标准的链式思维和其他解码方法。

Conclusion: RED为提高视觉语言模型的推理可靠性和准确性提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Motivation: 探讨在数据集偏移情况下，不同校准方法的效果及其相互作用，为实践者提供优化校准的实用建议。

Method: 通过广泛的实验，比较多种后处理校准方法和训练中校准策略（如标签平滑）在八种不同分类任务中的表现。

Result: 发现熵正则化与标签平滑结合效果最佳，后处理校准需少量ODD数据支持，校准方法改进有限于简单方法，提升偏移校准可能牺牲ID校准。

Conclusion: 研究表明预训练模型校准更优，集成方法结合预训练能有效提升校准鲁棒性。

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 传统视觉提示调优方法使用固定于所有输入实例的数据集级提示，导致性能不佳。为解决这一问题，ViaPT通过生成实例感知提示来优化。

Method: ViaPT利用主成分分析（PCA）生成每个输入实例的感知提示，并将其与数据集级提示融合，平衡两级知识并减少可学习参数。

Result: 在34个多样化数据集上的实验表明，ViaPT始终优于现有基线方法，为视觉提示分析优化提供了新范式。

Conclusion: ViaPT通过实例感知提示提升了视觉变压器的性能，同时减少了参数数量，为视觉提示调优提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

Method: 作者提出Recall框架，通过优化对抗性图像提示（基于参考图像）来攻击去学习后的模型，而非仅依赖对抗性文本提示。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前去学习机制的局限性，强调了增强生成模型安全性和可靠性的必要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are
publicly available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/ryliu68/RECALL}.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

Conclusion: 通过结构化语义中介，实现了从EEG信号出发的认知对齐视觉解码。

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型仅从原始视频数据学习，难以捕捉几何感知结构，与物理世界的3D本质存在差距。

Method: 提出Geometry Forcing，通过Angular Alignment和Scale Alignment两个几何对齐目标，将中间表示与预训练几何基础模型的特征对齐。

Result: 在相机视角和动作条件视频生成任务中，方法显著优于基线方法，提升了视觉质量和3D一致性。

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing通过几何对齐目标有效增强了视频扩散模型的3D表征能力。

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual
quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（LLMs）处理大量时空令牌时会因二次计算复杂度而效率低下，需解决这一问题。

Method: STTM通过多粒度空间令牌和定向时间维度合并，减少令牌数量，同时保留关键信息。

Result: 在6个视频QA基准测试中表现优异，50%令牌预算下速度提升2倍且准确率仅下降0.5%。

Conclusion: STTM提供了一种高效且通用的视频理解解决方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Conclusion: KARL展示了自适应图像标记与算法信息理论的关联，其预测复杂性结果与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

Conclusion: DMPO为扩散模型提供了一种理论与实践结合的高效对齐途径。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Motivation: 探究训练数据中概念组合对CLIP和多模态模型泛化能力的影响，特别是在常见对象以不常见配对出现时的准确性变化。

Method: 使用PMI衡量词共现频率，通过合成图像和自然图像编辑实验验证PMI与模型性能的关系，并扩展到多模态模型。

Result: PMI与CLIP零样本准确性高度相关（r=0.97），自然图像中相关性为r=0.75，且在LMM中同样观察到类似效应。

Conclusion: 表明模型性能受概念组合影响显著，需改进算法和架构以提升组合泛化能力，而非仅依赖数据规模扩展。

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

Method: 采用多层GNN框架，整合图注意力网络（空间）、图卷积网络（时间）和图同构网络（因果），并通过注意力加权嵌入融合。

Result: 模型在30天F1分数上达到0.8935 ± 0.0258，优于XGBoost和随机森林。基于HDBSCAN的聚类识别出8个风险组，其中最高风险组每年388.4次故障，恢复时间602.6分钟。

Conclusion: 该框架通过改进故障预测和风险聚类，支持电网主动管理。

Abstract: Unplanned power outages cost the US economy over $150 billion annually,
partly due to predictive maintenance (PdM) models that overlook spatial,
temporal, and causal dependencies in grid failures. This study introduces a
multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable
resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from
Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework
integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks
(temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through
attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935
+/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and
single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops
performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering
on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The
highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and
602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62
incidents/year. ANOVA (p < 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster
separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a
Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527. This work supports
proactive grid management through improved failure prediction and risk-aware
substation clustering.

Conclusion: PILOC在动态和通信受限的场景下表现优异，为未来多智能体搜救应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Search and Rescue (MASAR) plays a vital role in disaster
response, exploration, and reconnaissance. However, dynamic and unknown
environments pose significant challenges due to target unpredictability and
environmental uncertainty. To tackle these issues, we propose PILOC, a
framework that operates without global prior knowledge, leveraging local
perception and communication. It introduces a pheromone inverse guidance
mechanism to enable efficient coordination and dynamic target localization.
PILOC promotes decentralized cooperation through local communication,
significantly reducing reliance on global channels. Unlike conventional
heuristics, the pheromone mechanism is embedded into the observation space of
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), supporting indirect agent coordination based
on environmental cues. We further integrate this strategy into a DRL-based
multi-agent architecture and conduct extensive experiments. Results show that
combining local communication with pheromone-based guidance significantly
boosts search efficiency, adaptability, and system robustness. Compared to
existing methods, PILOC performs better under dynamic and
communication-constrained scenarios, offering promising directions for future
MASAR applications.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效、准确地检测异常，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load
manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At
each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the
cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by
detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or
cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using
only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,
unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a
brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on
known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using
Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds
triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the
latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.
Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind
intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%
average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative
evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates
higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

Abstract: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design
for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear
and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine
learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics.
However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively
affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling
in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and
real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine
learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The
results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust
generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling
framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify
predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction
intervals with a theoretical guarantee.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能补充现有验证实践，为构建更可靠和可重复的AEBS验证框架铺路。

Abstract: The safety validation of automatic emergency braking system (AEBS) requires
accurately distinguishing between false positive (FP) and true positive (TP)
system activations. While simulations allow straightforward differentiation by
comparing scenarios with and without interventions, analyzing activations from
open-loop resimulations - such as those from field operational testing (FOT) -
is more complex. This complexity arises from scenario parameter uncertainty and
the influence of driver interventions in the recorded data. Human labeling is
frequently used to address these challenges, relying on subjective assessments
of intervention necessity or situational criticality, potentially introducing
biases and limitations. This work proposes a rule-based classification approach
leveraging the Prediction Divergence Principle (PDP) to address those issues.
Applied to a simplified AEBS, the proposed method reveals key strengths,
limitations, and system requirements for effective implementation. The findings
suggest that combining this approach with human labeling may enhance the
transparency and consistency of classification, thereby improving the overall
validation process. While the rule set for classification derived in this work
adopts a conservative approach, the paper outlines future directions for
refinement and broader applicability. Finally, this work highlights the
potential of such methods to complement existing practices, paving the way for
more reliable and reproducible AEBS validation frameworks.

Abstract: Decisions about managing patients on the heart transplant waitlist are
currently made by committees of doctors who consider multiple factors, but the
process remains largely ad-hoc. With the growing volume of longitudinal
patient, donor, and organ data collected by the United Network for Organ

approaches to support clinical decision-making at the time of organ
availability. In this study, we benchmark machine learning models that leverage
longitudinal waitlist history data for time-dependent, time-to-event modeling
of waitlist mortality. We train on 23,807 patient records with 77 variables and
evaluate both survival prediction and discrimination at a 1-year horizon. Our

Abstract: Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.
Recently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad
slot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective
method for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing
mechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend
to focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper
identifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.
For multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \textbf{BundleNet}, a novel
bundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint
advertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms
generated by \textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in
the single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the
multi-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while
ensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual
rationality.

Key words: TCONV, 边缘设备, 硬件-软件协同设计, 加速器, 生成模型

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AR

Motivation: 现有TCONV实现的IOM方法存在计算复杂和性能瓶颈问题，尤其在资源受限的边缘设备上表现不佳。

Method: 提出硬件-软件协同设计的MM2IM加速器，结合MatMul和col2IM处理TCONV层，通过SECDA-TFLite工具包实现。

Result: 在261种TCONV配置中平均提速1.9倍，在生成模型中最高提速4.2倍，能效比为2x GOPs/DSP以上。DCGAN和pix2pix模型中提速3倍，能耗降低2.4倍。

Conclusion: MM2IM有效解决了TCONV在边缘设备上的性能瓶颈，显著提升生成模型的运行效率。

Abstract: Transposed Convolutions (TCONV) enable the up-scaling mechanism within
generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. However, the predominant
Input-Oriented Mapping (IOM) method for implementing TCONV has complex output
mapping, overlapping sums, and ineffectual computations. These inefficiencies
further exacerbate the performance bottleneck of TCONV and generative models on
resource-constrained edge devices. To address this problem, in this paper we
propose MM2IM, a hardware-software co-designed accelerator that combines Matrix
Multiplication (MatMul) with col2IM to process TCONV layers on
resource-constrained edge devices efficiently. Using the SECDA-TFLite design
toolkit, we implement MM2IM and evaluate its performance across 261 TCONV
problem configurations, achieving an average speedup of 1.9x against a
dual-thread ARM Neon optimized CPU baseline. We then evaluate the performance
of MM2IM on a range of TCONV layers from well-known generative models achieving
up to 4.2x speedup, and compare it against similar resource-constrained TCONV
accelerators, outperforming them by at least 2x GOPs/DSP. Finally, we evaluate
MM2IM on the DCGAN and pix2pix GAN models, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2.4x
energy reduction against the CPU baseline.

Key words: AI生成描述, 视觉语言模型, 档案编目, 考古, 人类-AI协作

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI生成的目录描述是否能接近人类写作质量，并评估了AI在档案和博物馆编目工作中的应用潜力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 由于摄影收藏的快速增长超过了人工编目能力，研究动机是探索AI是否能自动化生成高质量的编目描述。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型（InternVL2）为考古照片生成目录描述，并通过专家和非专家的评价框架进行评估。

Result: 参与者对AI生成描述的识别能力有限，高质量描述更难区分，专家对AI工具的接受度较低。

Conclusion: 研究表明AI可作为辅助工具生成草稿，但仍需人类审核以确保专业领域的准确性，信任建设是关键。

Abstract: The accelerating growth of photographic collections has outpaced manual
cataloguing, motivating the use of vision language models (VLMs) to automate
metadata generation. This study examines whether Al-generated catalogue
descriptions can approximate human-written quality and how generative Al might
integrate into cataloguing workflows in archival and museum collections. A VLM
(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on
labelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and
archaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental
framework. Participants classified descriptions as AI-generated or
expert-written, rated quality, and reported willingness to use and trust in AI
tools. Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups
underestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors
and hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in
accuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review
is necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions
generated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like
archaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,
emphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.
These findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft
generation but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment
with curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency). The successful
integration of this approach depends not only on technical advancements, such
as domain-specific fine-tuning, but even more on establishing trust among
professionals, which could both be fostered through a transparent and
explainable AI pipeline.

handling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus
on higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools,
emphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected
feedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model
combining traditional coaching with AI-supported exercises.

### [203] [FedP3E: Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange for Non-IID IoT Malware Detection in Cross-Silo Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07258)
*Rami Darwish,Mahmoud Abdelsalam,Sajad Khorsandroo,Kaushik Roy*

Key words: 联邦学习, 隐私保护, 恶意软件检测, 数据异构性, SMOTE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型联邦学习框架FedP3E，旨在解决物联网（IoT）环境中隐私保护和数据异构性问题，特别是针对罕见恶意软件类别的检测。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 随着IoT生态系统的扩展，恶意软件攻击日益复杂，需要隐私保护且能处理数据异构性的检测框架。现有的联邦学习算法（如FedAvg和FedProx）在处理非独立同分布数据和类别不平衡问题时效果有限。

Method: FedP3E通过高斯混合模型（GMM）构建类别原型，加入高斯噪声以保护隐私，并通过服务器聚合原型分发回客户端。结合SMOTE增强少数类别的表示，而不依赖原始数据或梯度交换。

Result: 在N-BaIoT数据集上的实验表明，FedP3E在数据不平衡的跨机构场景中表现良好，有效减少了统计异构性的负面影响。

Conclusion: FedP3E提供了一种隐私保护的解决方案，通过原型共享和增强策略，改进了联邦学习中数据异构性和类别不平衡的处理能力。

Abstract: As IoT ecosystems continue to expand across critical sectors, they have
become prominent targets for increasingly sophisticated and large-scale malware
attacks. The evolving threat landscape, combined with the sensitive nature of
IoT-generated data, demands detection frameworks that are both
privacy-preserving and resilient to data heterogeneity. Federated Learning (FL)
offers a promising solution by enabling decentralized model training without
exposing raw data. However, standard FL algorithms such as FedAvg and FedProx
often fall short in real-world deployments characterized by class imbalance and
non-IID data distributions -- particularly in the presence of rare or disjoint
malware classes. To address these challenges, we propose FedP3E
(Privacy-Preserving Prototype Exchange), a novel FL framework that supports
indirect cross-client representation sharing while maintaining data privacy.
Each client constructs class-wise prototypes using Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs), perturbs them with Gaussian noise, and transmits only these compact
summaries to the server. The aggregated prototypes are then distributed back to
clients and integrated into local training, supported by SMOTE-based
augmentation to enhance representation of minority malware classes. Rather than
relying solely on parameter averaging, our prototype-driven mechanism enables
clients to enrich their local models with complementary structural patterns
observed across the federation -- without exchanging raw data or gradients.
This targeted strategy reduces the adverse impact of statistical heterogeneity
with minimal communication overhead. We evaluate FedP3E on the N-BaIoT dataset
under realistic cross-silo scenarios with varying degrees of data imbalance.

Key words: 提示注入攻击,大型语言模型,白盒攻击,注意力机制,安全性

TL;DR: 论文评估了针对大型语言模型（LLM）提示注入攻击的防御方法，通过优化攻击显示这些防御并不具备宣称的安全性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 针对LLM的提示注入攻击日益严重，已有多种防御方法基于指令与数据分离的理念，但其安全性尚未在强攻击下得到验证。

Method: 提出了一种基于注意力的新型攻击算法，并在SecAlign和StruQ两种防御系统上进行了测试。

Result: 攻击成功率高达70%，且攻击者预算仅需适度增加。

Conclusion: 这些防御方法在白盒设置下并不具备足够的安全性，研究为理解其鲁棒性提供了基础。

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release
our code and attacks at https://github.com/nishitvp/better_opts_attacks

Abstract: Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, underscoring the
need for detection systems that strike a balance between high accuracy and
computational efficiency. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of
traditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized
small-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through
experiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently
underperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they
exhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.
We also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,
revealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance
of both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models
like DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above
80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient
deployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and
cost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide
concise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These
findings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence
systems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into
modern cybersecurity frameworks.

Result: 实验显示检测准确率提高6.3%，误报减少9.0%，同时保持近实时响应。

Conclusion: 语言模型整合为现代网络安全提供了智能、可扩展且高效的防御方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to intrusion detection by integrating
traditional signature-based methods with the contextual understanding
capabilities of the GPT-2 Large Language Model (LLM). As cyber threats become
increasingly sophisticated, particularly in distributed, heterogeneous, and
resource-constrained environments such as those enabled by the Internet of
Things (IoT), the need for dynamic and adaptive Intrusion Detection Systems
(IDSs) becomes increasingly urgent. While traditional methods remain effective
for detecting known threats, they often fail to recognize new and evolving
attack patterns. In contrast, GPT-2 excels at processing unstructured data and
identifying complex semantic relationships, making it well-suited to uncovering
subtle, zero-day attack vectors. We propose a hybrid IDS framework that merges
the robustness of signature-based techniques with the adaptability of
GPT-2-driven semantic analysis. Experimental evaluations on a representative
intrusion dataset demonstrate that our model enhances detection accuracy by
6.3%, reduces false positives by 9.0%, and maintains near real-time
responsiveness. These results affirm the potential of language model
integration to build intelligent, scalable, and resilient cybersecurity
defences suited for modern connected environments.

Conclusion: 多密钥扩展方法能有效减轻水印窃取攻击，为生成式AI提供商提供更强的保护。

Abstract: Watermarking offers a promising solution for GenAI providers to establish the
provenance of their generated content. A watermark is a hidden signal embedded
in the generated content, whose presence can later be verified using a secret
watermarking key. A threat to GenAI providers are \emph{watermark stealing}
attacks, where users forge a watermark into content that was \emph{not}
generated by the provider's models without access to the secret key, e.g., to
falsely accuse the provider. Stealing attacks collect \emph{harmless}
watermarked samples from the provider's model and aim to maximize the expected
success rate of generating \emph{harmful} watermarked samples. Our work focuses
on mitigating stealing attacks while treating the underlying watermark as a
black-box. Our contributions are: (i) Proposing a multi-key extension to
mitigate stealing attacks that can be applied post-hoc to any watermarking
method across any modality. (ii) We provide theoretical guarantees and
demonstrate empirically that our method makes forging substantially less
effective across multiple datasets, and (iii) we formally define the threat of
watermark forging as the task of generating harmful, watermarked content and
model this threat via security games.

Motivation: 无线定位与感知技术在现代无线网络中至关重要，尤其是在智能城市、物联网和自治系统中。现有的高维CSI特性在MIMO-OFDM系统中的联合建模研究不足，因此需要开发一种高效的方法来优化这两项任务。

Method: 论文首先将定位和感知建模为一个混合整数双层深度学习问题，然后提出了SPG-MIBO算法。该算法利用小批量训练，适用于高维和大规模数据集，并具备理论收敛保证。

Conclusion: SPG-MIBO算法通过联合建模和优化定位与感知任务，显著提升了性能，并在高维和大规模数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Wireless localization and sensing technologies are essential in modern
wireless networks, supporting applications in smart cities, the Internet of
Things (IoT), and autonomous systems. High-performance localization and sensing
systems are critical for both network efficiency and emerging intelligent
applications. Integrating channel state information (CSI) with deep learning
has recently emerged as a promising solution. Recent works have leveraged the
spatial diversity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and the
frequency granularity of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
waveforms to improve spatial resolution. Nevertheless, the joint modeling of
localization and sensing under the high-dimensional CSI characteristics of
MIMO-OFDM systems remains insufficiently investigated. This work aims to
jointly model and optimize localization and sensing tasks to harness their
potential synergy. We first formulate localization and sensing as a
mixed-integer bilevel deep learning problem and then propose a novel stochastic
proximal gradient-based mixed-integer bilevel optimization (SPG-MIBO)
algorithm. SPG-MIBO is well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale
datasets, leveraging mini-batch training at each step for computational and
memory efficiency. The algorithm is also supported by theoretical convergence
guarantees. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate its
effectiveness and highlight the performance gains from joint localization and
sensing optimization.

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 解决移动和边缘设备在训练深度神经网络时的内存限制问题，特别是激活压缩的效率和实用性挑战。

Method: DAF采用混合归约操作、CPU-GPU协作位打包和重要性感知分页内存管理。

Result: 实验显示内存使用减少了22.9倍，训练速度提高了3.2倍，且不影响模型精度。

Conclusion: DAF为资源受限环境提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in on-device training for deep neural networks have
underscored the critical need for efficient activation compression to overcome
the memory constraints of mobile and edge devices. As activations dominate
memory usage during training and are essential for gradient computation,
compressing them without compromising accuracy remains a key research
challenge. While existing methods for dynamic activation quantization promise
theoretical memory savings, their practical deployment is impeded by
system-level challenges such as computational overhead and memory
fragmentation.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DAF, a Dynamic Activation Framework
that enables scalable and efficient on-device training through system-level
optimizations. DAF achieves both memory- and time-efficient dynamic
quantization training by addressing key system bottlenecks. It develops hybrid
reduction operations tailored to the memory hierarchies of mobile and edge
SoCs, leverages collaborative CPU-GPU bit-packing for efficient dynamic
quantization, and implements an importance-aware paging memory management
scheme to reduce fragmentation and support dynamic memory adjustments.
  These optimizations collectively enable DAF to achieve substantial memory
savings and speedup without compromising model training accuracy. Evaluations
on various deep learning models across embedded and mobile platforms
demonstrate up to a $22.9\times$ reduction in memory usage and a $3.2\times$
speedup, making DAF a scalable and practical solution for resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: 该框架为多输入分类任务提供了灵活且高效的工具，尤其适合公民科学应用。

Abstract: Conformal prediction methods are statistical tools designed to quantify
uncertainty and generate predictive sets with guaranteed coverage
probabilities. This work introduces an innovative refinement to these methods
for classification tasks, specifically tailored for scenarios where multiple
observations (multi-inputs) of a single instance are available at prediction
time. Our approach is particularly motivated by applications in citizen
science, where multiple images of the same plant or animal are captured by
individuals. Our method integrates the information from each observation into
conformal prediction, enabling a reduction in the size of the predicted label
set while preserving the required class-conditional coverage guarantee. The
approach is based on the aggregation of conformal p-values computed from each
observation of a multi-input. By exploiting the exact distribution of these
p-values, we propose a general aggregation framework using an abstract scoring
function, encompassing many classical statistical tools. Knowledge of this
distribution also enables refined versions of standard strategies, such as
majority voting. We evaluate our method on simulated and real data, with a
particular focus on Pl@ntNet, a prominent citizen science platform that
facilitates the collection and identification of plant species through
user-submitted images.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning pipelines trained on features derived from
persistent homology have been experimentally observed to ignore much of the
information contained in a persistence diagram. Computing persistence diagrams
is often the most computationally demanding step in such a pipeline, however.
To explore this, we introduce several methods to generate topological feature
vectors from unreduced boundary matrices. We compared the performance of
pipelines trained on vectorizations of unreduced PDs to vectorizations of
fully-reduced PDs across several data and task types. Our results indicate that
models trained on PDs built from unreduced diagrams can perform on par and even
outperform those trained on fully-reduced diagrams on some tasks. This
observation suggests that machine learning pipelines which incorporate
topology-based features may benefit in terms of computational cost and
performance by utilizing information contained in unreduced boundary matrices.

Abstract: Double descent is a phenomenon of over-parameterized statistical models. Our
goal is to view double descent from a Bayesian perspective. Over-parameterized
models such as deep neural networks have an interesting re-descending property
in their risk characteristics. This is a recent phenomenon in machine learning
and has been the subject of many studies. As the complexity of the model
increases, there is a U-shaped region corresponding to the traditional
bias-variance trade-off, but then as the number of parameters equals the number
of observations and the model becomes one of interpolation, the risk can become
infinite and then, in the over-parameterized region, it re-descends -- the
double descent effect. We show that this has a natural Bayesian interpretation.
Moreover, we show that it is not in conflict with the traditional Occam's razor
that Bayesian models possess, in that they tend to prefer simpler models when
possible. We illustrate the approach with an example of Bayesian model
selection in neural networks. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.

Abstract: When performing Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
methods, two considerations arise: the accuracy of the posterior approximation
and computational efficiency. To address computational demands, Sequential
Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing
(HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can
improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to
high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The
Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that
particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper,
we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the
Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored
previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the
first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals
not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature
(second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on
synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size
selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other
proposals.

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 传统的ARIMA模型局限于线性假设，并且在大型复杂数据集中计算成本高。

Method: 提出Galerkin-ARIMA，用样条基函数替代ARIMA的AR部分，并通过Galerkin投影估计，保留了MA成分和高斯噪声假设。

Result: 模型在标准条件下具有渐进无偏和一致性，且预测性能和计算效率优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Galerkin-ARIMA结合了经典时间序列建模和非参数回归的优势，是一种高效且灵活的方法。

Abstract: Time-series models like ARIMA remain widely used for forecasting but limited
to linear assumptions and high computational cost in large and complex
datasets. We propose Galerkin-ARIMA that generalizes the AR component of ARIMA
and replace it with a flexible spline-based function estimated by Galerkin
projection. This enables the model to capture nonlinear dependencies in lagged
values and retain the MA component and Gaussian noise assumption. We derive a
closed-form OLS estimator for the Galerkin coefficients and show the model is
asymptotically unbiased and consistent under standard conditions. Our method
bridges classical time-series modeling and nonparametric regression, which
offering improved forecasting performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的通用框架不仅能统一现有方法，还能通过整合点无标签数据显著提升性能。

Abstract: To alleviate the annotation burden in supervised learning, N-tuples learning
has recently emerged as a powerful weakly-supervised method. While existing
N-tuples learning approaches extend pairwise learning to higher-order
comparisons and accommodate various real-world scenarios, they often rely on
task-specific designs and lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this paper,
we propose a general N-tuples learning framework based on empirical risk
minimization, which systematically integrates pointwise unlabeled data to
enhance learning performance. This paper first unifies the data generation
processes of N-tuples and pointwise unlabeled data under a shared probabilistic
formulation. Based on this unified view, we derive an unbiased empirical risk
estimator that generalizes a broad class of existing N-tuples models. We
further establish a generalization error bound for theoretical support. To
demonstrate the flexibility of the framework, we instantiate it in four
representative weakly supervised scenarios, each recoverable as a special case
of our general model. Additionally, to address overfitting issues arising from
negative risk terms, we adopt correction functions to adjust the empirical
risk. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework and demonstrate that leveraging pointwise unlabeled data
consistently improves generalization across various N-tuples learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 传统推荐算法无法基于用户提供的文本偏好生成个性化推荐，LLM为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 结合SVD/SVD++算法与LLM，生成初始推荐并通过语言输入优化结果。

Result: LLM增强框架在多个评估指标上显著优于传统方法（如累积命中率提升6倍，NDCG提升3.7倍）。

Conclusion: LLM能有效提升推荐系统的个性化能力，但需权衡计算开销。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

Main category: cond-mat.dis-nn

Motivation: 传统混合整数优化器在处理实际约束（如交易限额和交易成本）下的投资组合优化问题时面临困难，需要更高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: VNA是一种高效且可扩展的方法，适用于复杂约束下的投资组合优化问题。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in
financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints
such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a
mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often
struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like
Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its
classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We
demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios
comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence
on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis
applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing
universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm
on portfolio optimization problems.

Result: PAOA在26自旋Sherrington-Kirkpatrick模型上的表现优于QAOA，并且在FPGA概率计算机上实现了对大型3D自旋玻璃问题的有效解决。

Conclusion: PAOA通过优化多个温度分布，自然扩展了模拟退火算法，并在类似SK-Lévy的重尾问题上表现出更优性能。

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends
and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling
parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic
computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of
binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples.
We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the
gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a
principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting
case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an
FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D
spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior
performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing
by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance
over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解和设计最优学习协议提供了理论基础，并提出了基于统计物理学的元学习理论路径。

Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

Motivation: 实现数据空间中的语义互操作性，需解决语义数据在DLT上的高效存储问题。

Method: 使用真实知识图谱实验，比较不同类型DLT的性能、存储效率、资源消耗及数据更新与查询能力。

Result: 私有DLT在存储和管理语义内容上最有效率；混合DLT在公共审计性与操作效率间提供折中方案。

Conclusion: 选择DLT基础设施需基于去中心化数据生态系统的数据主权需求。

Abstract: Data spaces are emerging as decentralised infrastructures that enable
sovereign, secure, and trustworthy data exchange among multiple participants.
To achieve semantic interoperability within these environments, the use of
semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs has been proposed. Although
distributed ledger technologies (DLT) fit as the underlying infrastructure for
data spaces, there remains a significant gap in terms of the efficient storage
of semantic data on these platforms. This paper presents a systematic
evaluation of semantic data storage across different types of DLT (public,
private, and hybrid), using a real-world knowledge graph as an experimental
basis. The study compares performance, storage efficiency, resource
consumption, and the capabilities to update and query semantic data. The
results show that private DLTs are the most efficient for storing and managing
semantic content, while hybrid DLTs offer a balanced trade-off between public
auditability and operational efficiency. This research leads to a discussion on
the selection of the most appropriate DLT infrastructure based on the data
sovereignty requirements of decentralised data ecosystems.

Motivation: 研究机器学习任务中集体通信行为对网络拥塞和性能的影响，以优化网络资源配置。

Method: 通过Nvidia Collective Communication Library记录通信行为，调整参数（并行度、节点数、模型类型）进行分析。

Result: 发现现有通信框架和网络拓扑需改进以应对网络异常对负载的影响。

Conclusion: 需要重新设计集体通信框架和网络拓扑以适应机器学习工作负载的需求。

Abstract: Machine Learning jobs, carried out on large number of distributed high
performance systems, involve periodic communication using operations like
AllReduce, AllGather, and Broadcast. These operations may create high bandwidth
and bursty traffic patterns, leading to network congestion and packet loss,
thus impacting the performance of these jobs. Hence it is imperative to analyze
these patterns, which can be helpful in provisioning network resources
depending on the type of machine learning workloads. In this poster we carry
out extensive analysis of the collective communication behavior seen in a wide
variety of models (ex. DeepSeek, GPT, Llama, etc.) To achieve this we
instrument Nvidia Collective Communication Library logging functionality for
richer context about the collectives and workloads. We adjust configuration
parameters that influence collective communication behavior, such as
parallelism, number of nodes, and model type. This overview presents and
discusses some of the results on the collective communication behavior for the
open source DeepSeek V3 inferencing model, which includes operation type and
count, transfer sizes per operation, and request size distribution. Our
analysis shows that it makes sense to rethink current collective communication
frameworks and network topologies so as to accommodate the effect of network
anomalies on the mentioned workloads.

Main category: cs.DC

Motivation: 随着LLM的KV历史增长，现有并行方法在实时解码中面临KV缓存读取和FFN权重访问的瓶颈，效率受限。

Method: Helix Parallelism结合了KV并行和TP/EP并行，通过分片KV缓存和批次重叠通信优化性能。

Result: Helix在固定批次下将TTL降低1.5倍，支持32倍更大的批次，提升了吞吐量-延迟的平衡。

Conclusion: Helix Parallelism提升了超长序列实时推理的实用性。

Abstract: As LLMs scale to multi-million-token KV histories, real-time autoregressive
decoding under tight Token-to-Token Latency (TTL) constraints faces growing
pressure. Two core bottlenecks dominate: accessing Feed-Forward Network (FFN)
weights and reading long KV caches. While Tensor Parallelism (TP) helps
mitigate the cost of FFN weight reads, it does not scale well for attention.
When TP width exceeds the number of KV heads, it leads to inefficient KV
duplication, limits parallelism, and constrains batch size. Simultaneously,
DRAM reads for long KV histories scale linearly with batch size, further
capping efficiency.
  We introduce Helix Parallelism, a hybrid execution strategy that applies KV
parallelism during attention to shard KV caches across GPUs, then reuses the
same GPUs for TP in dense LLMs or TPxExpert Parallel (EP) in MoEs during FFN
computation. To preserve exact attention behavior, Helix includes a lightweight
communication step. To minimize the exposed communication cost, we introduce
Helix HOP-B. Helix HOP-B effectively minimizes communication overhead through
batchwise overlap, preserving low TTL while improving GPU efficiency. Compared
to conventional parallelism approaches, Helix reduces TTL by up to 1.5x at
fixed batch sizes and supports up to 32x larger batches under the same latency
budget for DeepSeek-R1, pushing forward the throughput-latency Pareto on
Blackwell and making real-time inference with ultra-long-sequence practical.

Motivation: 当前分布式框架依赖可靠连接，导致延迟高且扩展性受限。不可靠连接虽降低延迟，但会因丢包影响模型精度和收敛。论文旨在解决这一关键问题。

Method: 采用两阶段防御机制：1）无偏梯度聚合，从接收到的数据包中重建一致性梯度；2）有界参数广播，确保模型间差异有限。

Result: 在LLAMA2 7B模型实验中，容忍10%丢包时困惑度变化仅为0.8%。

Conclusion: 该框架在不可靠连接下实现了高效训练，填补了通信效率与模型精度间的鸿沟。

Abstract: State-of-the-art language and vision models are routinely trained across
thousands of GPUs, often spanning multiple data-centers, yet today's
distributed frameworks still assume reliable connections (e.g., InfiniBand or
RoCE). The resulting acknowledgment traffic and retransmissions inflate tail
latencies and limit scalability. Leveraging unreliable connections will reduce
latency but may sacrifice model accuracy and convergence once packets are
dropped. A principled, end-to-end solution that preserves accuracy and
convergence guarantees under genuine packet loss has previously been missing.
We address this critical gap by introducing a novel distributed training
framework capable of operating over unreliable connections, offering unbiased
gradient aggregation and bounded parameter drift without modifying model code
or optimizers. The key insight is a two-stage defense against missing messages:
(i) Unbiased gradient aggregation: each worker reconstructs a consistent
gradient estimate from whatever packets arrive, guaranteeing expectation-level
correctness; and (ii) Bounded-drift parameter broadcasts: we prove the
inter-worker model discrepancy remains O(1) even after arbitrarily many
iterations, preventing the unbounded divergence typical of asynchronous setups.
Analytical bounds are matched by experiments on the LLAMA2 7B model with 64
GPUs: tolerating 10% random packet loss yields at most 0.8% perplexity change.
This work bridges the gap between communication-efficient datacenter protocols
and the accuracy and generalization guarantees demanded by modern large-model
training, enabling robust, high-throughput learning on commodity or wide-area
networks.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中的高计算成本和通信开销问题，尤其是在非IID数据下模型性能下降的问题。

Result: Ampere在精度、训练时间、通信和计算开销方面均优于现有SFL系统，尤其在非IID数据下表现优异。

Conclusion: Ampere为联邦学习提供了一种高效、低开销且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: A Federated Learning (FL) system collaboratively trains neural networks
across devices and a server but is limited by significant on-device computation
costs. Split Federated Learning (SFL) systems mitigate this by offloading a
block of layers of the network from the device to a server. However, in doing
so, it introduces large communication overheads due to frequent exchanges of
intermediate activations and gradients between devices and the server and
reduces model accuracy for non-IID data. We propose Ampere, a novel
collaborative training system that simultaneously minimizes on-device
computation and device-server communication while improving model accuracy.
Unlike SFL, which uses a global loss by iterative end-to-end training, Ampere
develops unidirectional inter-block training to sequentially train the device
and server block with a local loss, eliminating the transfer of gradients. A
lightweight auxiliary network generation method decouples training between the
device and server, reducing frequent intermediate exchanges to a single
transfer, which significantly reduces the communication overhead. Ampere
mitigates the impact of data heterogeneity by consolidating activations
generated by the trained device block to train the server block, in contrast to
SFL, which trains on device-specific, non-IID activations. Extensive
experiments on multiple CNNs and transformers show that, compared to
state-of-the-art SFL baseline systems, Ampere (i) improves model accuracy by up
to 13.26% while reducing training time by up to 94.6%, (ii) reduces
device-server communication overhead by up to 99.1% and on-device computation
by up to 93.13%, and (iii) reduces standard deviation of accuracy by 53.39% for
various non-IID degrees highlighting superior performance when faced with
heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Computational models have become one of the prevalent methods to model
complex phenomena. To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed
biomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised
of several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from
microscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between
different time and length scales has historically been challenging but the
advent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling
that task. Multiscale models require massive amounts of computational power and
a powerful workflow management system. Orchestrating ML-driven multiscale
studies on parallel systems with thousands of nodes is challenging, the
workflow must schedule, allocate and control thousands of simulations operating
at different scales. Here, we discuss the massively parallel Multiscale
Machine-Learned Modeling Infrastructure (MuMMI), a multiscale workflow
management infrastructure, that can orchestrate thousands of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations operating at different timescales, spanning from millisecond
to nanosecond. More specifically, we introduce a novel version of MuMMI called
"mini-MuMMI". Mini-MuMMI is a curated version of MuMMI designed to run on
modest HPC systems or even laptops whereas MuMMI requires larger HPC systems.
We demonstrate mini-MuMMI utility by exploring RAS-RAF membrane interactions
and discuss the different challenges behind the generalization of multiscale
workflows and how mini-MuMMI can be leveraged to target a broader range of
applications outside of MD and RAS-RAF interactions.

Abstract: We introduce the task of generative panoramic image stitching, which aims to
synthesize seamless panoramas that are faithful to the content of multiple

image stitching pipelines fail, producing outputs with ghosting and other
artifacts. While recent generative models are capable of outpainting content
consistent with multiple reference images, they fail when tasked with
synthesizing large, coherent regions of a panorama. To address these
limitations, we propose a method that fine-tunes a diffusion-based inpainting
model to preserve a scene's content and layout based on multiple reference
images. Once fine-tuned, the model outpaints a full panorama from a single
reference image, producing a seamless and visually coherent result that
faithfully integrates content from all reference images. Our approach
significantly outperforms baselines for this task in terms of image quality and
the consistency of image structure and scene layout when evaluated on captured
datasets.

Key words: PET-CT, 病变分割, 双提示驱动网络, 癌症特异性, 个性化风险分层

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DpDNet的双提示驱动网络，通过捕捉癌症特异性特征和共享知识，提高了PET-CT病变分割的性能，并在四种癌症类型数据集上表现优于现有模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 由于噪声敏感性、病变形态多变以及生理高代谢信号的干扰，PET-CT病变分割具有挑战性。现有方法忽略不同癌症类型的独特性，因此需改进。

Method: DpDNet结合了特定提示和通用提示，采用提示感知头自适应处理多任务分割，避免早期引入提示导致的信息遗忘。

Result: 实验表明DpDNet优于现有模型，并基于分割结果计算了乳腺癌生存分析的临床指标（MTV、TLG、SUVmax），支持个性化风险分层。

Conclusion: DpDNet有望成为优化治疗策略的实用工具，提升临床决策的准确性。

Abstract: PET-CT lesion segmentation is challenging due to noise sensitivity, small and
variable lesion morphology, and interference from physiological high-metabolic
signals. Current mainstream approaches follow the practice of one network
solving the segmentation of multiple cancer lesions by treating all cancers as
a single task. However, this overlooks the unique characteristics of different
cancer types. Considering the specificity and similarity of different cancers
in terms of metastatic patterns, organ preferences, and FDG uptake intensity,
we propose DpDNet, a Dual-Prompt-Driven network that incorporates specific
prompts to capture cancer-specific features and common prompts to retain shared
knowledge. Additionally, to mitigate information forgetting caused by the early
introduction of prompts, prompt-aware heads are employed after the decoder to
adaptively handle multiple segmentation tasks. Experiments on a PET-CT dataset
with four cancer types show that DpDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models.
Finally, based on the segmentation results, we calculated MTV, TLG, and SUVmax
for breast cancer survival analysis. The results suggest that DpDNet has the
potential to serve as a valuable tool for personalized risk stratification,
supporting clinicians in optimizing treatment strategies and improving
outcomes. Code is available at https://github.com/XinglongLiang08/DpDNet.

Motivation: 颈动脉斑块的分析对评估动脉粥样硬化和缺血性中风风险至关重要，但斑块形态复杂且标记数据稀缺，因此需要高精度的分割方法。

Method: 提出了一种两阶段网络：粗定位模型确定感兴趣区域，精细分割模型精确分割血管壁和斑块。结合了多序列融合策略和半监督学习方法。

Result: 在52名患者的五序列MRI数据上验证了方法的有效性，强调了U-Net架构中融合点选择的重要性，并通过专家评估验证了结果准确性。

Conclusion: 多序列融合策略和半监督学习在数据有限的MRI应用中可显著提升颈动脉分割性能。

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

level of precision in sound source localization. In addition to our model, we
also present a new dataset of simulated spatial audio-caption pairs. Evaluation
of our models demonstrate that they are capable of matching the semantic
alignment and audio quality of state of the art models while capturing the
desired spatial attributes.

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 现有神经音频编解码器和自编码器通常侧重于重建保真度，忽略了下游应用所需的特定潜空间结构。为了弥补这一缺陷，作者提出了一种改进方法。

Method: 通过“Re-Bottleneck”框架修改预训练自编码器的瓶颈，仅通过潜空间损失训练内部瓶颈，以注入用户定义的结构。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在排序潜通道、语义嵌入对齐以及引入等变性方面的有效性，且不牺牲重建质量。

Conclusion: Re-Bottleneck提供了一种灵活高效的方式，能够根据应用需求定制神经音频模型的表示。

Abstract: Neural audio codecs and autoencoders have emerged as versatile models for
audio compression, transmission, feature-extraction, and latent-space
generation. However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize
reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure
necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We
propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the
bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a
"Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space
losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent
channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents
with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion
modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation
on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the
latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and
efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them
to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal
additional training.

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 尽管ASR模型在多种音频应用中表现出色，但在资源受限的边缘设备上部署仍面临内存、计算和功耗限制的挑战。量化技术（尤其是训练后量化PTQ）为解决这一问题提供了有效途径。

Method: 对两种领先的边缘ASR模型家族（Whisper和Moonshine）应用了八种先进的PTQ方法，并通过七个公开ASR数据集系统评估了性能，包括准确性、内存I/O和位操作。

Result: 研究表明，即使3位量化在高容量模型上也能通过先进的PTQ技术实现成功。

Conclusion: 结果为在低功耗、始终在线的边缘设备上优化ASR模型提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have demonstrated
remarkable accuracy and robustness in diverse audio applications, such as live
transcription and voice command processing. However, deploying these models on
resource constrained edge devices (e.g., IoT device, wearables) still presents
substantial challenges due to strict limits on memory, compute and power.
Quantization, particularly Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), offers an
effective way to reduce model size and inference cost without retraining.
Despite its importance, the performance implications of various advanced
quantization methods and bit-width configurations on ASR models remain unclear.
In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmark of eight state-of-the-art
(SOTA) PTQ methods applied to two leading edge-ASR model families, Whisper and
Moonshine. We systematically evaluate model performances (i.e., accuracy,
memory I/O and bit operations) across seven diverse datasets from the open ASR
leaderboard, analyzing the impact of quantization and various configurations on
both weights and activations. Built on an extension of the LLM compression
toolkit, our framework integrates edge-ASR models, diverse advanced
quantization algorithms, a unified calibration and evaluation data pipeline,
and detailed analysis tools. Our results characterize the trade-offs between
efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that even 3-bit quantization can succeed
on high capacity models when using advanced PTQ techniques. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing ASR models on low-power, always-on
edge devices.

Method: 通过区分分布式和去中心化训练场景，分析其对计算治理假设的挑战及政策杠杆的适用性。

Result: 发现这些趋势可能削弱检测与关闭能力，但也可能带来隐私保护和权力分散的益处。

Conclusion: 强调政策制定需更精确，以应对计算、能力扩散和去中心化AI发展的挑战与机遇。

Abstract: Advances in low-communication training algorithms are enabling a shift from
centralised model training to compute setups that are either distributed across
multiple clusters or decentralised via community-driven contributions. This
paper distinguishes these two scenarios - distributed and decentralised
training - which are little understood and often conflated in policy discourse.
We discuss how they could impact technical AI governance through an increased
risk of compute structuring, capability proliferation, and the erosion of
detectability and shutdownability. While these trends foreshadow a possible new
paradigm that could challenge key assumptions of compute governance, we
emphasise that certain policy levers, like export controls, remain relevant. We
also acknowledge potential benefits of decentralised AI, including
privacy-preserving training runs that could unlock access to more data, and
mitigating harmful power concentration. Our goal is to support more precise
policymaking around compute, capability proliferation, and decentralised AI
development.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于其他候选强子态，为S矩阵中的极点结构推断提供了可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central
challenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new
hadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a
variety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole
structure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce
similar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is
especially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is
limited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning
approach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is
based on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on
predictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\%$ while
discarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on
synthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously
unseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the
$P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole
structure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the
presence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While
evaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to
other candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure
inference in scattering amplitudes.

Main category: cs.MM

Motivation: 当前SNN架构在大规模语音处理任务中面临两大挑战：多时间步尖峰发射导致的高计算开销和缺乏针对语音任务的定制化大规模架构。作者旨在通过IML-Spikeformer解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了IML-Spikeformer架构，包括Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)机制和Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA)模块与Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM)结合的HD-RepSSA模块，用于优化注意力图和捕获多尺度时间依赖性。

Result: 在AiShell-1和Librispeech-960数据集上分别实现了6.0%和3.4%的词错误率，与传统ANN变换器相当，同时理论推理能耗降低了4.64倍和4.32倍。

Conclusion: IML-Spikeformer在性能和能效上均表现出色，标志着大规模语音处理SNN架构的重要进展。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological neural mechanisms,
represent a promising neuromorphic computing paradigm that offers
energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
Despite proven effectiveness, SNN architectures have struggled to achieve
competitive performance on large-scale speech processing task. Two key
challenges hinder progress: (1) the high computational overhead during training
caused by multi-timestep spike firing, and (2) the absence of large-scale SNN
architectures tailored to speech processing tasks. To overcome the issues, we
introduce Input-aware Multi-Level Spikeformer, i.e. IML-Spikeformer, a spiking
Transformer architecture specifically designed for large-scale speech
processing. Central to our design is the Input-aware Multi-Level Spike (IMLS)
mechanism, which simulate multi-timestep spike firing within a single timestep
using an adaptive, input-aware thresholding scheme. IML-Spikeformer further
integrates a Reparameterized Spiking Self-Attention (RepSSA) module with a
Hierarchical Decay Mask (HDM), forming the HD-RepSSA module. This module
enhances the precision of attention maps and enables modeling of multi-scale
temporal dependencies in speech signals. Experiments demonstrate that
IML-Spikeformer achieves word error rates of 6.0\% on AiShell-1 and 3.4\% on
Librispeech-960, comparable to conventional ANN transformers while reducing
theoretical inference energy consumption by 4.64$\times$ and 4.32$\times$
respectively. IML-Spikeformer marks an advance of scalable SNN architectures
for large-scale speech processing in both task performance and energy
efficiency.

Conclusion: SGD和SHB在不同条件下均表现出良好的收敛性能，SHB在凸函数和特定步长策略下具有高效的概率收敛速率。

Abstract: We study the almost sure convergence rate for the last iterate of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) and stochastic heavy ball (SHB) in the parametric
setting when the objective function $F$ is globally convex or non-convex whose
gradient is $\gamma$-H\"{o}lder. Using only discrete Gronwall's inequality
without Robbins-Siegmund theorem nor martingale convergence theory, we recover
results for both SGD and SHB: $\min_{s\leq t} \|\nabla F(w_s)\|^2 = o(t^{p-1})$
for non-convex objectives and $F(w_t) - F_* = o(t^{2\gamma/(1+\gamma) \cdot
\max(p-1,-2p+1)-\epsilon})$ for $\beta \in (0, 1)$ and $\min_{s \leq t} F(w_s)
- F_* = o(t^{p-1})$ almost surely for convex objectives. In addition, we proved
that SHB with constant momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ attains a
convergence rate of $F(w_t) - F_* = O(t^{\max(p-1,-2p+1)} \log^2
\frac{t}{\delta})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$ when $F$ is convex and
$\gamma = 1$ and step size $\alpha_t = \Theta(t^{-p})$ with $p \in

Motivation: 金融时间序列由于复杂的非线性关系和有限的数据可用性，预测具有挑战性，TSFMs通过预训练和任务适应提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 研究比较了TTM和Chronos两种TSFMs在三种金融预测任务（美国10年期国债收益率变化、欧元/美元波动性和股票价差预测）中的表现。

Result: 预训练的TTM在数据有限时表现优于未训练模型，但在一些任务中仍不及传统专业模型。

Conclusion: TSFMs在金融预测中表现出潜力，特别是在数据有限的任务中，但需要领域特定的预训练和架构优化。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting presents significant challenges due to
complex nonlinear relationships, temporal dependencies, variable
interdependencies and limited data availability, particularly for tasks
involving low-frequency data, newly listed instruments, or emerging market
assets. Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) offer a promising solution
through pretraining on diverse time series corpora followed by task-specific
adaptation. This study evaluates two TSFMs (Tiny Time Mixers (TTM) and Chronos)
across three financial forecasting tasks: US 10-year Treasury yield changes,
EUR/USD volatility, and equity spread prediction. Results demonstrate that TTM
exhibits strong transferability. When fine-tuning both the pretrained version
of TTM and an untrained model with the same architecture, the pretrained
version achieved 25-50% better performance when fine-tuned on limited data and
15-30% improvements even when fine-tuned on lengthier datasets. Notably, TTM's
zero-shot performance outperformed naive benchmarks in volatility forecasting
and equity spread prediction, with the latter demonstrating that TSFMs can
surpass traditional benchmark models without fine-tuning. The pretrained model
consistently required 3-10 fewer years of data to achieve comparable
performance levels compared to the untrained model, demonstrating significant
sample-efficiency gains. However, while TTM outperformed naive baselines,
traditional specialised models matched or exceeded its performance in two of
three tasks, suggesting TSFMs prioritise breadth over task-specific
optimisation. These findings indicate that TSFMs, though still nascent, offer
substantial promise for financial forecasting-particularly in noisy,
data-constrained tasks-but achieving competitive performance likely requires
domain-specific pretraining and architectural refinements tailored to financial
time series characteristics.

Motivation: 探究在多面体的标准计算模型中，通过Minkowski和与凸包的并集来近似目标多面体的能力，特别关注近似深度对结果的影响。

Method: 研究多面体的近似，尤其是单纯形的近似特性，分析Minkowski和及凸包运算在多面体近似中的作用。

Result: 主要结果表明单纯形只能被“平凡近似”，同时首次给出了单纯形作为唯一“外加法”凸体的完整刻画。

Conclusion: 单纯形在多面体近似中具有独特性质，其近似能力受限且具有唯一性，为多面体计算模型的理论研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study approximations of polytopes in the standard model for computing
polytopes using Minkowski sums and (convex hulls of) unions. Specifically, we
study the ability to approximate a target polytope by polytopes of a given
depth. Our main results imply that simplices can only be ``trivially
approximated''. On the way, we obtain a characterization of simplices as the
only ``outer additive'' convex bodies.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular generators based on diffusion models can now
reach near-crystallographic accuracy, yet they remain fragmented across tasks.
SMILES-only inputs, two-stage pretrain-finetune pipelines, and
one-task-one-model practices hinder stereochemical fidelity, task alignment,
and zero-shot transfer. We introduce MODA, a diffusion framework that unifies
fragment growing, linker design, scaffold hopping, and side-chain decoration
with a Bayesian mask scheduler. During training, a contiguous spatial fragment
is masked and then denoised in one pass, enabling the model to learn shared
geometric and chemical priors across tasks. Multi-task training yields a
universal backbone that surpasses six diffusion baselines and three training
paradigms on substructure, chemical property, interaction, and geometry.
Model-C reduces ligand-protein clashes and substructure divergences while
maintaining Lipinski compliance, whereas Model-B preserves similarity but
trails in novelty and binding affinity. Zero-shot de novo design and
lead-optimisation tests confirm stable negative Vina scores and high
improvement rates without force-field refinement. These results demonstrate
that a single-stage multi-task diffusion routine can replace two-stage
workflows for structure-based molecular design.

Abstract: Existing machine learning methods for molecular (e.g., gene) embeddings are
restricted to specific tasks or data modalities, limiting their effectiveness
within narrow domains. As a result, they fail to capture the full breadth of
gene functions and interactions across diverse biological contexts. In this
study, we have systematically evaluated knowledge representations of
biomolecules across multiple dimensions representing a task-agnostic manner
spanning three major data sources, including omics experimental data,
literature-derived text data, and knowledge graph-based representations. To
distinguish between meaningful biological signals from chance correlations, we
devised an adjusted variant of Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis
(SVCCA) that quantifies signal redundancy and complementarity across different
data modalities and sources. These analyses reveal that existing embeddings
capture largely non-overlapping molecular signals, highlighting the value of
embedding integration. Building on this insight, we propose Platform for
Representation and Integration of multimodal Molecular Embeddings (PRISME), a
machine learning based workflow using an autoencoder to integrate these
heterogeneous embeddings into a unified multimodal representation. We validated
this approach across various benchmark tasks, where PRISME demonstrated
consistent performance, and outperformed individual embedding methods in
missing value imputations. This new framework supports comprehensive modeling
of biomolecules, advancing the development of robust, broadly applicable
multimodal embeddings optimized for downstream biomedical machine learning
applications.

Abstract: This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for a
steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor, combining a mathematical model,
artificial neural network (ANN)-based hybrid modeling, advanced multi-objective
optimization (MOO) and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. A
one-dimensional fixed-bed reactor model accounting for internal mass transfer
resistance was employed to simulate reactor performance. To reduce the high
computational cost of the mathematical model, a hybrid ANN surrogate was
constructed, achieving a 93.8% reduction in average simulation time while
maintaining high predictive accuracy. The hybrid model was then embedded into
three MOO scenarios using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II
(NSGA-II) solver: 1) maximizing methane conversion and hydrogen output; 2)
maximizing hydrogen output while minimizing carbon dioxide emissions; and 3) a
combined three-objective case. The optimal trade-off solutions were further
ranked and selected using two MCDM methods: technique for order of preference
by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and simplified preference ranking on
the basis of ideal-average distance (sPROBID). Optimal results include a
methane conversion of 0.863 with 4.556 mol/s hydrogen output in the first case,
and 0.988 methane conversion with 3.335 mol/s hydrogen and 0.781 mol/s carbon
dioxide in the third. This comprehensive methodology offers a scalable and
effective strategy for optimizing complex catalytic reactor systems with
multiple, often conflicting, objectives.
