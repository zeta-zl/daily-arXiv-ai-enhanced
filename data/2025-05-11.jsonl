A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,\ninstead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with\nonly one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently\nplay roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social\nsettings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically\nmeasured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an\nagent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.\nConcurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII\nbelow), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social\nagents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:\nformat parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable\nconversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion\ncapabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,\nHSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform\nan ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'\nsocial performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new\nstatistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs\nwith COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between\nmeasurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments\ndemonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in\nLLMs."}

Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented\nhas been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that\npolicy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a\npotential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is\nunsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, \"Value-free\" --\nwhile they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting\n(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching\nto PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of\nbehavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems\nfrom the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by\nthe standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve\nit. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as\npart of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the\ndifferent methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,\ninstead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the\nunderlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from\nan experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be\nreconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,\nfull-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are\nrelaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as\na case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than\nstatistical, view of what constitutes \"a model\" in cognitive sciences.

In order to ensure the feasibility of the\nCPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be\nhandled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that\nsome patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of\nthe study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes\nclearly.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies\ncorrectly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the\ngroup scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the\nimpact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,\ndifferent prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating\nexplanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that\nperformance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.\nHowever, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group\ncomplexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can\nsignificantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,\nwhile adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting\nfor explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research\nshould include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect\non LLM performance.

This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model\n(LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer\narchitecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural\nlanguage text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an\nalgorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor\nrisk protection.

Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented\nhas been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that\npolicy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a\npotential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is\nunsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, \"Value-free\" --\nwhile they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting\n(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching\nto PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of\nbehavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems\nfrom the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by\nthe standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve\nit. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as\npart of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the\ndifferent methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,\ninstead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the\nunderlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from\nan experimental perspective.

Moreover, to the best of our\nknowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the\nassumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently\nand identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a\nfixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle\ndata across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the\ntuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In\nthis paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under\nnon-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically.

MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role:\nResidual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to\nmaintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures\nuser-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension;\nLLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for\nrefinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory,\ndetect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy.\nTemporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information\nwhile discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground\nTruth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference;\nDomain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and\nmanufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets;\nPersonalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user\npreferences, ensuring coherent responses over time."}

Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in\nparticular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English.\nOverall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the\nlimitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time\nscaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason\nin high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning\nin low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts."}

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs\nfaithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT\nfaithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints\npresented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested,\nCoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the\nhint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement\nlearning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and\n(3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward\nhacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without\ntraining against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a\npromising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations,\nbut that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in\nsettings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring\nof CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected\nbehaviors."}

The simulated system closely\nfollows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime\nof agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly\noptimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing\nvaluable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more\ngenerally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing\nare primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.\nThese are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference\ngoal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The\nregime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical\ndamping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple\nstages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to\na diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between\nquasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and\nincoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales\nof space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the\nbest-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the\nresponding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is\ninterpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding\nlearning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body\nphysics out of equilibrium."}

However, these methods suffer from the\nissues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the\nnoisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and\ndispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we\npropose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and\nprovide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our\nmethod using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the\nflexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance\nof LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple\nbase and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with\nbenchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show\nthe effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations\nof existing direct alignment methods.
