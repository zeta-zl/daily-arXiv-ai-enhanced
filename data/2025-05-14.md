### [1] [Polysemy of Synthetic Neurons Towards a New Type of Explanatory Categorical Vector Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07831)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种几何方法，将神经网络的神经元定义为具有非正交基的分类向量空间，通过类内注意力过程提高语言模型效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工神经网络中神经元的多义性来源，提供一种新的几何视角，以优化语言模型的性能。

Method: 将第n层的神经元定义为由第n-1层神经元提取的分类子维度构成的非正交基分类向量空间，并通过类内注意力机制识别关键分类区域。

Result: 该方法能更高效地利用神经元的激活空间，找到分类子维度的交集区域，提升语言模型的同质性和表现。

Conclusion: 几何定义神经元为分类向量空间的方法为理解神经网络多义性提供了新思路，并实际优化了模型效率。

Abstract: The polysemantic nature of synthetic neurons in artificial intelligence
language models is currently understood as the result of a necessary
superposition of distributed features within the latent space. We propose an
alternative approach, geometrically defining a neuron in layer n as a
categorical vector space with a non-orthogonal basis, composed of categorical
sub-dimensions extracted from preceding neurons in layer n-1. This categorical
vector space is structured by the activation space of each neuron and enables,
via an intra-neuronal attention process, the identification and utilization of
a critical categorical zone for the efficiency of the language model - more
homogeneous and located at the intersection of these different categorical
sub-dimensions.

*Pranav Narayanan Venkit,Jiayi Li,Yingfan Zhou,Sarah Rajtmajer,Shomir Wilson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了LLM生成合成人物时对少数族裔身份的表现问题，发现存在过度强调种族标记和文化编码语言，导致刻板印象等问题，提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在数据有限领域（如健康、隐私、HCI）中生成合成人物的应用增加，了解这些叙述如何表现少数族裔身份变得至关重要。

Method: 通过混合方法（包括细读、词汇分析和参数化创造力框架）比较1512个LLM生成人物与人类编写回应，聚焦种族身份的表示问题。

Result: 研究发现LLM过度强调种族标记，使用文化编码语言，生成的人物在句法上精细但叙述上简单，导致刻板印象等社会技术危害。

Conclusion: 论文提出“算法他者化”概念，建议设计叙事感知评估指标和社区中心验证协议以改进合成身份生成。

Abstract: As LLMs (large language models) are increasingly used to generate synthetic
personas particularly in data-limited domains such as health, privacy, and HCI,
it becomes necessary to understand how these narratives represent identity,
especially that of minority communities. In this paper, we audit synthetic
personas generated by 3 LLMs (GPT4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Deepseek 2.5) through the
lens of representational harm, focusing specifically on racial identity. Using
a mixed methods approach combining close reading, lexical analysis, and a
parameterized creativity framework, we compare 1512 LLM generated personas to
human-authored responses. Our findings reveal that LLMs disproportionately
foreground racial markers, overproduce culturally coded language, and construct
personas that are syntactically elaborate yet narratively reductive. These
patterns result in a range of sociotechnical harms, including stereotyping,
exoticism, erasure, and benevolent bias, that are often obfuscated by
superficially positive narrations. We formalize this phenomenon as algorithmic
othering, where minoritized identities are rendered hypervisible but less
authentic. Based on these findings, we offer design recommendations for
narrative-aware evaluation metrics and community-centered validation protocols
for synthetic identity generation.

### [3] [Joint Detection of Fraud and Concept Drift inOnline Conversations with LLM-Assisted Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07852)
*Ali Senol,Garima Agrawal,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段检测框架，结合集成分类和概念漂移分析，用于实时检测数字通信平台中的虚假交互，显著提高了准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字通信平台中的虚假交互（如垃圾信息或诈骗）检测存在挑战，传统静态异常检测方法难以适应动态对话变化，易误判良性话题转换。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) 使用集成分类模型识别可疑对话；2) 通过概念漂移分析（OCDD）和LLM评估，区分欺诈性话题转移与良性变化。

Result: 在社交工程聊天数据集上验证，框架在准确性和可解释性上优于双LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统检测的误判问题，为实时欺诈检测提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting fake interactions in digital communication platforms remains a
challenging and insufficiently addressed problem. These interactions may appear
as harmless spam or escalate into sophisticated scam attempts, making it
difficult to flag malicious intent early. Traditional detection methods often
rely on static anomaly detection techniques that fail to adapt to dynamic
conversational shifts. One key limitation is the misinterpretation of benign
topic transitions referred to as concept drift as fraudulent behavior, leading
to either false alarms or missed threats. We propose a two stage detection
framework that first identifies suspicious conversations using a tailored
ensemble classification model. To improve the reliability of detection, we
incorporate a concept drift analysis step using a One Class Drift Detector
(OCDD) to isolate conversational shifts within flagged dialogues. When drift is
detected, a large language model (LLM) assesses whether the shift indicates
fraudulent manipulation or a legitimate topic change. In cases where no drift
is found, the behavior is inferred to be spam like. We validate our framework
using a dataset of social engineering chat scenarios and demonstrate its
practical advantages in improving both accuracy and interpretability for real
time fraud detection. To contextualize the trade offs, we compare our modular
approach against a Dual LLM baseline that performs detection and judgment using
different language models.

### [4] [CrashSage: A Large Language Model-Centered Framework for Contextual and Interpretable Traffic Crash Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07853)
*Hao Zhen,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrashSage 是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架，用于改进道路事故分析。它通过将结构化数据转换为文本叙事、数据增强、微调模型以及可解释性技术，显著提升了事故严重性推断的性能和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路事故每年造成巨大的人员和经济损失，传统统计方法难以捕捉复杂关系和上下文信息，亟需更先进的解决方案。

Method: 采用表格到文本的转换策略、数据增强、微调 LLaMA3-8B 模型，并结合梯度可解释性技术。

Result: 在事故严重性推断任务上，CrashSage 表现优于零样本、思维链提示和小样本学习等多种基线模型。

Conclusion: CrashSage 不仅提升了分析性能，还通过可解释性技术为道路安全干预提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Road crashes claim over 1.3 million lives annually worldwide and incur global
economic losses exceeding \$1.8 trillion. Such profound societal and financial
impacts underscore the urgent need for road safety research that uncovers crash
mechanisms and delivers actionable insights. Conventional statistical models
and tree ensemble approaches typically rely on structured crash data,
overlooking contextual nuances and struggling to capture complex relationships
and underlying semantics. Moreover, these approaches tend to incur significant
information loss, particularly in narrative elements related to multi-vehicle
interactions, crash progression, and rare event characteristics. This study
presents CrashSage, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-centered framework
designed to advance crash analysis and modeling through four key innovations.
First, we introduce a tabular-to-text transformation strategy paired with
relational data integration schema, enabling the conversion of raw,
heterogeneous crash data into enriched, structured textual narratives that
retain essential structural and relational context. Second, we apply
context-aware data augmentation using a base LLM model to improve narrative
coherence while preserving factual integrity. Third, we fine-tune the LLaMA3-8B
model for crash severity inference, demonstrating superior performance over
baseline approaches, including zero-shot, zero-shot with chain-of-thought
prompting, and few-shot learning, with multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA3-70B). Finally, we employ a gradient-based explainability technique to
elucidate model decisions at both the individual crash level and across broader
risk factor dimensions. This interpretability mechanism enhances transparency
and enables targeted road safety interventions by providing deeper insights
into the most influential factors.

### [5] [Unpacking Robustness in Inflectional Languages: Adversarial Evaluation and Mechanistic Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07856)
*Paweł Walkowiak,Marek Klonowski,Marcin Oleksy,Arkadiusz Janz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了对抗性攻击在屈折语言中的表现，提出了一种基于Edge Attribution Patching (EAP)的新评估协议，通过对比波兰语和英语的平行语料库，分析了屈折对模型鲁棒性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数对抗性攻击方法主要在非屈折语言（如英语）中开发和评估。本文旨在探究屈折语言中对抗性攻击的表现及其对模型行为的影响，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 作者设计了一种基于Edge Attribution Patching (EAP)的评估协议，使用波兰语和英语的平行任务特定语料库（包括屈折和同义词变体），并通过MultiEmo数据集创建了新基准来分析模型中的屈折相关机制。

Result: 研究发现屈折语言中对抗性攻击的表现与模型行为的关系，揭示了屈折对模型鲁棒性的具体影响机制。

Conclusion: 本文通过创新的评估协议和数据集，为屈折语言中的对抗性攻击研究提供了新见解，未来可扩展至更多语言场景。

Abstract: Various techniques are used in the generation of adversarial examples,
including methods such as TextBugger which introduce minor, hardly visible
perturbations to words leading to changes in model behaviour. Another class of
techniques involves substituting words with their synonyms in a way that
preserves the text's meaning but alters its predicted class, with TextFooler
being a prominent example of such attacks. Most adversarial example generation
methods are developed and evaluated primarily on non-inflectional languages,
typically English. In this work, we evaluate and explain how adversarial
attacks perform in inflectional languages. To explain the impact of inflection
on model behaviour and its robustness under attack, we designed a novel
protocol inspired by mechanistic interpretability, based on Edge Attribution
Patching (EAP) method. The proposed evaluation protocol relies on parallel
task-specific corpora that include both inflected and syncretic variants of
texts in two languages -- Polish and English. To analyse the models and explain
the relationship between inflection and adversarial robustness, we create a new
benchmark based on task-oriented dataset MultiEmo, enabling the identification
of mechanistic inflection-related elements of circuits within the model and
analyse their behaviour under attack.

### [6] [Enhanced Urdu Intent Detection with Large Language Models and Prototype-Informed Predictive Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07857)
*Faiza Hassan,Summra Saleem,Kashif Javed,Muhammad Nabeel Asim,Abdur Rehman,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对比学习的方法LLMPIA，用于提升乌尔都语的意图检测能力，结合预训练语言模型和原型注意力机制，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为第十大语言，其意图检测研究较为滞后，缺乏基于少样本学习的模型。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过利用未标注数据和对比学习提升模型性能。

Method: 采用对比学习方法，结合预训练语言模型和原型注意力机制（LLMPIA），评估了6种语言模型和13种相似性计算方法。

Result: 在ATIS和Web Queries数据集上，LLMPIA在4-way 1-shot和4-way 5-shot设定下分别取得83.28%/98.25%和76.23%/84.42%的F1分数，并在相同类别的测试中超越现有最佳模型53.55%。

Conclusion: LLMPIA框架显著提升了乌尔都语意图检测的性能，证明了对比学习和原型注意力机制的有效性。

Abstract: Multifarious intent detection predictors are developed for different
languages, including English, Chinese and French, however, the field remains
underdeveloped for Urdu, the 10th most spoken language. In the realm of
well-known languages, intent detection predictors utilize the strategy of
few-shot learning and prediction of unseen classes based on the model training
on seen classes. However, Urdu language lacks few-shot strategy based intent
detection predictors and traditional predictors are focused on prediction of
the same classes which models have seen in the train set. To empower Urdu
language specific intent detection, this introduces a unique contrastive
learning approach that leverages unlabeled Urdu data to re-train pre-trained
language models. This re-training empowers LLMs representation learning for the
downstream intent detection task. Finally, it reaps the combined potential of
pre-trained LLMs and the prototype-informed attention mechanism to create a
comprehensive end-to-end LLMPIA intent detection pipeline. Under the paradigm
of proposed predictive pipeline, it explores the potential of 6 distinct
language models and 13 distinct similarity computation methods. The proposed
framework is evaluated on 2 public benchmark datasets, namely ATIS encompassing
5836 samples and Web Queries having 8519 samples. Across ATIS dataset under
4-way 1 shot and 4-way 5 shot experimental settings LLMPIA achieved 83.28% and
98.25% F1-Score and on Web Queries dataset produced 76.23% and 84.42% F1-Score,
respectively. In an additional case study on the Web Queries dataset under same
classes train and test set settings, LLMPIA outperformed state-of-the-art
predictor by 53.55% F1-Score.

### [7] [Scaling Laws for Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07858)
*Siyuan Yan,Mo Zhu,Guo-qing Jiang,Jianfei Wang,Jiaxing Chen,Wentai Zhang,Xiang Liao,Xiao Cui,Chen Zhang,Zhuoran Song,Ran Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过密集LLM架构的推测解码技术，以加速推理任务。发现了对数线性缩放规律，并开发了Scylla系统，显著提升解码效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（如OpenAI-o3和DeepSeek-R1）在推理任务中对高效解码的需求日益增长，亟需研究加速技术。

Method: 通过密集LLM架构探索推测解码技术，发现对数线性缩放规律（定理1.1-1.3），并开发多维度协调的Scylla系统。

Result: Scylla在解码接受率和性能上优于EAGLE系列（1.5-2.2倍），工业部署中解码吞吐量提升2倍。

Conclusion: 系统性缩放对高效LLM推理具有变革性潜力，Scylla展示了显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The escalating demand for efficient decoding in large language models (LLMs)
is particularly critical for reasoning-intensive architectures like OpenAI-o3
and DeepSeek-R1, which depend on extended chain-of-thought reasoning. This
study investigates speculative decoding techniques through dense LLM
architectures to establish foundational insights for accelerating reasoning
tasks. While speculative decoding methods leveraging parallel
draft-verification cycles have emerged as promising acceleration techniques,
the scaling laws governing decoding efficiency remain under-explored compared
to conventional backbone LLMs developed through Pretraining->SFT->RLHF training
paradigms. In this work, we discover Log-linear Scaling Laws (Theorem 1.1, 1.2
and 1.3) governing draft model acceptance rate (or decoding speed) across three
dimensions: pretraining token volume, draft model capacity, and decoding batch
size. Building on these laws, we achieve Scylla, which coordinates
multi-dimensional scaling for popular LLMs (Llama2/3, Qwen2.5). Empirical
validation shows Scylla achieves 1.5-2.2 higher acceptance rate than EAGLE2 and
0.3 higher than EAGLE3 at temperature T = 0, with peak performance gains on
summarization and QA tasks (Figure 2). Industrial inference engine deployments
demonstrate 2X decoding throughput improvements over EAGLE2 (Table 5),
validating the transformative potential of systematic scaling for efficient LLM
inference. Code will be released later.

### [8] [Boosting Performance on ARC is a Matter of Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07859)
*Daniel Franzen,Jan Disselhoff,David Hartmann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过任务特定的数据增强和深度优先搜索算法，提升了大型语言模型（LLM）在抽象推理任务（ARC-AGI）中的表现，达到71.6%的分数，并强调其透明性和低成本优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型语言模型在抽象推理任务（ARC-AGI）中的局限性，研究旨在通过数据增强和优化生成策略提升其表现。

Method: 采用任务特定的数据增强技术，结合深度优先搜索算法生成多样化的候选解决方案，并利用LLM的生成和评分能力筛选最优解。

Result: 在公开ARC-AGI评估集上获得71.6%的分数（解决286.5/400任务），是目前公开方法中的最佳表现。

Conclusion: 该方法在透明性、可复现性和低成本（每次任务约2美分）方面具有显著优势，为抽象推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) poses a significant challenge
for large language models (LLMs), exposing limitations in their abstract
reasoning abilities. In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations
throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a
depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate
solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as
a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising
solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the
public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among
publicly available approaches. While concurrent closed-source work has reported
higher scores, our method distinguishes itself through its transparency,
reproducibility, and remarkably low inference cost, averaging only around 2ct
per task on readily available hardware (we assume a price of 36ct/hour for a
Nvidia 4090 GPU).

### [9] [Scalable LLM Math Reasoning Acceleration with Low-rank Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07861)
*Harry Dong,Bilge Acun,Beidi Chen,Yuejie Chi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Caprese是一种低成本蒸馏方法，旨在恢复大型语言模型（LLM）在数学推理中因效率优化而损失的能力，同时不影响语言任务表现，且显著减少计算资源和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的高效推理方法在语言任务上表现良好，但在数学推理中表现严重下降，需要一种方法在不增加太多成本的情况下恢复这些能力。

Method: 通过低成本的蒸馏方法，仅增加1%的参数并使用20K合成训练样本，专注于前馈块，恢复因高效推理而损失的数学能力。

Result: Caprese成功恢复了数学推理能力，减少了活跃参数（如Gemma 2 9B和Llama 3.1 8B中减少约2B参数），并降低延迟（如Qwen 2.5 14B生成2048个令牌时延迟减少11%以上）。

Conclusion: Caprese是一种高效且低成本的方法，能够在保持语言任务性能的同时，恢复数学推理能力并降低计算开销。

Abstract: Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands
significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient
inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation
on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper,
we propose Caprese, a low-cost distillation method to recover lost capabilities
from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward
blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters,
and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all
of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and
without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the
number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and
integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>11% reduction
to generate 2048 tokens with Qwen 2.5 14B) while encouraging response brevity.

### [10] [Graph Laplacian Wavelet Transformer via Learnable Spectral Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07862)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Eric Lundy,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Graph Wavelet Transformer (GWT)的新架构，用于解决传统序列到序列模型中点积自注意力机制的高计算和内存开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列到序列模型在处理结构化语言任务时，依赖于点积自注意力机制，导致计算和内存的二次复杂度，限制了模型的效率和扩展性。

Method: 引入了GWT，通过基于显式图拉普拉斯算子的可学习多尺度小波变换，替代了点积自注意力机制。该方法利用了语法或语义解析的图结构。

Result: 分析表明，多尺度谱分解为图结构化序列建模提供了一种可解释、高效且表达能力强的替代方案。

Conclusion: GWT架构为结构化语言任务的序列建模提供了一种更高效的解决方案，同时保持了表达能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Existing sequence to sequence models for structured language tasks rely
heavily on the dot product self attention mechanism, which incurs quadratic
complexity in both computation and memory for input length N. We introduce the
Graph Wavelet Transformer (GWT), a novel architecture that replaces this
bottleneck with a learnable, multi scale wavelet transform defined over an
explicit graph Laplacian derived from syntactic or semantic parses. Our
analysis shows that multi scale spectral decomposition offers an interpretable,
efficient, and expressive alternative to quadratic self attention for graph
structured sequence modeling.

*Ziliang Wang,Xiaohong Zhang,Ze Shi Li,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QoSBERT：首个基于预训练语言模型的QoS预测框架，通过语义回归和蒙特卡洛Dropout不确定性估计提升预测精度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QoS模型依赖人工特征且缺乏不确定性评估，难以满足云服务管理中对可信预测的需求。

Method: 将QoS预测重构为语义回归任务，结合自然语言描述编码和蒙特卡洛Dropout模块，联合优化注意力池化与轻量级回归器。

Result: 在标准数据集上，响应时间预测的MAE和RMSE分别降低11.7%和6.7%，吞吐量预测MAE降低6.9%，并提供校准置信区间。

Conclusion: QoSBERT通过高精度预测和可靠不确定性量化，推动更可信的数据驱动服务选择与优化。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Quality of Service (QoS) metrics is fundamental for
selecting and managing cloud based services. Traditional QoS models rely on
manual feature engineering and yield only point estimates, offering no insight
into the confidence of their predictions. In this paper, we propose QoSBERT,
the first framework that reformulates QoS prediction as a semantic regression
task based on pre trained language models. Unlike previous approaches relying
on sparse numerical features, QoSBERT automatically encodes user service
metadata into natural language descriptions, enabling deep semantic
understanding. Furthermore, we integrate a Monte Carlo Dropout based
uncertainty estimation module, allowing for trustworthy and risk-aware service
quality prediction, which is crucial yet underexplored in existing QoS models.
QoSBERT applies attentive pooling over contextualized embeddings and a
lightweight multilayer perceptron regressor, fine tuned jointly to minimize
absolute error. We further exploit the resulting uncertainty estimates to
select high quality training samples, improving robustness in low resource
settings. On standard QoS benchmark datasets, QoSBERT achieves an average
reduction of 11.7% in MAE and 6.7% in RMSE for response time prediction, and
6.9% in MAE for throughput prediction compared to the strongest baselines,
while providing well calibrated confidence intervals for robust and trustworthy
service quality estimation. Our approach not only advances the accuracy of
service quality prediction but also delivers reliable uncertainty
quantification, paving the way for more trustworthy, data driven service
selection and optimization.

*Suavis Giramata,Madhusudan Srinivasan,Venkat Naidu Gudivada,Upulee Kanewala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于句子多样性的蜕变关系（MRs）优先级排序方法，以高效检测大语言模型（LLMs）中的公平性问题。相比随机和基于距离的优先级排序，该方法在故障检测率和首次故障发现时间上均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在广泛应用中的部署引发了对其输出公平性和偏见的关注。由于测试用例数量庞大，全面测试不可行，因此需要优先选择能有效检测公平性问题的蜕变关系（MRs）。

Method: 采用基于句子多样性的方法计算和排序蜕变关系（MRs），以优化故障检测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比随机优先级排序故障检测率提升22%，比基于距离的优先级排序提升12%，首次故障发现时间分别减少15%和8%。性能接近基于故障的优先级排序（差距5%），同时显著降低了标注成本。

Conclusion: 基于多样性的MR优先级排序方法能有效提升LLMs公平性测试的效率和效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various
applications, raising critical concerns about fairness and potential biases in
their outputs. This paper explores the prioritization of metamorphic relations
(MRs) in metamorphic testing as a strategy to efficiently detect fairness
issues within LLMs. Given the exponential growth of possible test cases,
exhaustive testing is impractical; therefore, prioritizing MRs based on their
effectiveness in detecting fairness violations is crucial. We apply a sentence
diversity-based approach to compute and rank MRs to optimize fault detection.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed prioritization approach
improves fault detection rates by 22% compared to random prioritization and 12%
compared to distance-based prioritization, while reducing the time to the first
failure by 15% and 8%, respectively. Furthermore, our approach performs within
5% of fault-based prioritization in effectiveness, while significantly reducing
the computational cost associated with fault labeling. These results validate
the effectiveness of diversity-based MR prioritization in enhancing fairness
testing for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AIAP（Annotators' Instruction Assisted Prompt），一种通过将标注者的任务说明整合到LLMs提示框架中，以改进金融情感分析（FSA）性能的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析基准数据集（如Financial Phrasebank）因标注者主观性导致标注差异大，使LLMs在评估时受到不公平的期望。论文旨在通过标准化任务定义提升分析公平性。

Method: 提出AIAP方法，将人类标注者的详细任务说明融入LLMs的提示框架，并使用WallStreetBets子论坛的新数据集WSBS验证其效果。

Result: 实验显示AIAP显著提升LLMs性能（最高提升9.08%），并提出基于模型置信度的情感索引方法，增强了股票价格预测模型。

Conclusion: AIAP通过任务定义的标准化和上下文丰富化，不仅提高了FSA性能，还展示了WallStreetBets作为金融文本来源的价值，为改进FSA评估方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis (FSA) presents unique challenges to LLMs that
surpass those in typical sentiment analysis due to the nuanced language used in
financial contexts. The prowess of these models is often undermined by the
inherent subjectivity of sentiment classifications in existing benchmark
datasets like Financial Phrasebank. These datasets typically feature undefined
sentiment classes that reflect the highly individualized perspectives of
annotators, leading to significant variability in annotations. This variability
results in an unfair expectation for LLMs during benchmarking, where they are
tasked to conjecture the subjective viewpoints of human annotators without
sufficient context. In this paper, we introduce the Annotators' Instruction
Assisted Prompt, a novel evaluation prompt designed to redefine the task
definition of FSA for LLMs. By integrating detailed task instructions
originally intended for human annotators into the LLMs' prompt framework, AIAP
aims to standardize the understanding of sentiment across both human and
machine interpretations, providing a fair and context-rich foundation for
sentiment analysis. We utilize a new dataset, WSBS, derived from the
WallStreetBets subreddit to demonstrate how AIAP significantly enhances LLM
performance by aligning machine operations with the refined task definitions.
Experimental results demonstrate that AIAP enhances LLM performance
significantly, with improvements up to 9.08. This context-aware approach not
only yields incremental gains in performance but also introduces an innovative
sentiment-indexing method utilizing model confidence scores. This method
enhances stock price prediction models and extracts more value from the
financial sentiment analysis, underscoring the significance of WSB as a
critical source of financial text. Our research offers insights into both
improving FSA through better evaluation methods.

*Yu Wang,Runxi Yu,Zhongyuan Wang,Jing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过结合LIWC特征和RoBERTa模型，分析了美国政治演讲中民粹主义的四种维度（左翼、右翼、反精英主义和人民中心主义）的语言特点，发现其具有直接、坚定的风格，右翼和人民中心主义更情绪化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索政治演讲中的民粹主义语言特征，揭示不同民粹主义维度如何通过语言风格传递情感和意识形态差异。

Method: 结合LIWC情感分析工具和RoBERTa模型，分析美国总统就职演说和国情咨文中的语言数据。

Result: 民粹主义语言风格通常直接且坚定，右翼和人民中心主义更情绪化，左翼和反精英主义则较为克制。

Conclusion: 民粹主义语言的风格因意识形态维度而异，右翼和人民中心主义更依赖情感化的表达。

Abstract: This study explores the sound of populism by integrating the classic
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features, which capture the emotional
and stylistic tones of language, with a fine-tuned RoBERTa model, a
state-of-the-art context-aware language model trained to detect nuanced
expressions of populism. This approach allows us to uncover the auditory
dimensions of political rhetoric in U.S. presidential inaugural and State of
the Union addresses. We examine how four key populist dimensions (i.e.,
left-wing, right-wing, anti-elitism, and people-centrism) manifest in the
linguistic markers of speech, drawing attention to both commonalities and
distinct tonal shifts across these variants. Our findings reveal that populist
rhetoric consistently features a direct, assertive ``sound" that forges a
connection with ``the people'' and constructs a charismatic leadership persona.
However, this sound is not simply informal but strategically calibrated.
Notably, right-wing populism and people-centrism exhibit a more emotionally
charged discourse, resonating with themes of identity, grievance, and crisis,
in contrast to the relatively restrained emotional tones of left-wing and
anti-elitist expressions.

### [15] [Recovering Event Probabilities from Large Language Model Embeddings via Axiomatic Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07883)
*Jian-Qiao Zhu,Haijiang Yan,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过变分自编码器（VAE）从大型语言模型（LLM）的嵌入中恢复符合概率论公理的连贯事件概率，以提高不确定性事件中的概率估计准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的事件概率存在不连贯性，违背概率论公理。研究旨在探索是否能从模型嵌入中恢复连贯的概率，以提供更准确的不确定性事件概率估计。

Method: 提出在变分自编码器（VAE）学习的潜在空间中强制应用概率论公理约束（如概率加性规则），通过同时重构原始嵌入和预测语义相关事件的嵌入，使事件概率自然从潜在空间中生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，从嵌入中恢复的概率比模型直接生成的概率更连贯，且更接近真实概率。

Conclusion: 通过潜在空间约束可以恢复大型语言模型嵌入中的连贯概率，为不确定性事件提供更可靠的估计。

Abstract: Rational decision-making under uncertainty requires coherent degrees of
belief in events. However, event probabilities generated by Large Language
Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit incoherence, violating the axioms of
probability theory. This raises the question of whether coherent event
probabilities can be recovered from the embeddings used by the models. If so,
those derived probabilities could be used as more accurate estimates in events
involving uncertainty. To explore this question, we propose enforcing axiomatic
constraints, such as the additive rule of probability theory, in the latent
space learned by an extended variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to LLM
embeddings. This approach enables event probabilities to naturally emerge in
the latent space as the VAE learns to both reconstruct the original embeddings
and predict the embeddings of semantically related events. We evaluate our
method on complementary events (i.e., event A and its complement, event not-A),
where the true probabilities of the two events must sum to 1. Experiment
results on open-weight language models demonstrate that probabilities recovered
from embeddings exhibit greater coherence than those directly reported by the
corresponding models and align closely with the true probabilities.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了WAZOBIA-NER系统，针对尼日利亚三大主要语言（豪萨语、约鲁巴语和伊博语）的命名实体识别（NER），通过结合机器学习（CRF）和深度学习模型（BiLSTM、BERT、RNN），解决了数据稀缺和语言多样性问题，并在评估中展现出高精度和高召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非洲语言在计算语言学中受到越来越多的关注，但现有的NER系统主要针对英语和欧洲语言，导致资源匮乏的语言存在显著空白。

Method: 研究通过整理标注数据集，结合CRF、BiLSTM、BERT和RNN等模型，并利用OCR技术处理文本图像输入，评估了这些方法在识别人物、组织和地点实体中的效果。

Result: WAZOBIA-NER系统在精确度（0.9511）、召回率（0.9400）、F1分数（0.9564）和准确率（0.9301）方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用现有NLP框架和迁移学习，可以为资源匮乏的非洲语言构建强大的NER工具。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition NER is very crucial for various natural language
processing applications, including information extraction, machine translation,
and sentiment analysis. Despite the ever-increasing interest in African
languages within computational linguistics, existing NER systems focus mainly
on English, European, and a few other global languages, leaving a significant
gap for under-resourced languages. This research presents the development of a
WAZOBIA-NER system tailored for the three most prominent Nigerian languages:
Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. This research begins with a comprehensive compilation
of annotated datasets for each language, addressing data scarcity and
linguistic diversity challenges. Exploring the state-of-the-art machine
learning technique, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and deep learning models
such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Bidirectional Encoder
Representation from Transformers (Bert) and fine-tune with a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN), the study evaluates the effectiveness of these approaches in
recognizing three entities: persons, organizations, and locations. The system
utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert textual
images into machine-readable text, thereby enabling the Wazobia system to
accept both input text and textual images for extraction purposes. The system
achieved a performance of 0.9511 in precision, 0.9400 in recall, 0.9564 in
F1-score, and 0.9301 in accuracy. The model's evaluation was conducted across
three languages, with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as key
assessment metrics. The Wazobia-NER system demonstrates that it is feasible to
build robust NER tools for under-resourced African languages using current NLP
frameworks and transfer learning.

*Chun-Pai Yang,Kan Zheng,Shou-De Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLHF是一个基于人类反馈的提示优化框架，适用于难以定义输出质量指标的场景，仅需一轮人类反馈即可完成优化，效果优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有方法在输出质量难以用标准样本评估时无法有效优化提示，PLHF旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: PLHF采用类似RLHF的技术，引入评估模块作为质量指标，仅需单轮人类反馈。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上，PLHF优于先前的输出评分策略。

Conclusion: PLHF为提示优化提供了一种高效且无需明确指标的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization frameworks are developed to obtain suitable
prompts for large language models (LLMs) with respect to desired output quality
metrics. Although existing approaches can handle conventional tasks such as
fixed-solution question answering, defining the metric becomes complicated when
the output quality cannot be easily assessed by comparisons with standard
golden samples. Consequently, optimizing the prompts effectively and
efficiently without a clear metric becomes a critical challenge. To address the
issue, we present PLHF (which stands for "P"rompt "L"earning with "H"uman
"F"eedback), a few-shot prompt optimization framework inspired by the
well-known RLHF technique. Different from naive strategies, PLHF employs a
specific evaluator module acting as the metric to estimate the output quality.
PLHF requires only a single round of human feedback to complete the entire
prompt optimization process. Empirical results on both public and industrial
datasets show that PLHF outperforms prior output grading strategies for LLM
prompt optimizations.

*Yusen Wu,Xiaotie Deng*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ZeroStylus的分层框架，通过句子级和段落级模板实现零样本长文本风格迁移，显著提升了风格一致性、内容保留和表达质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文本风格迁移中句子级和段落级一致性的挑战，提出无需并行语料库或LLM微调的方法。

Method: 分两阶段：从参考文本分层获取模板，再通过多粒度匹配生成。构建句子和段落模板库，保持上下文逻辑关系。

Result: 实验评估显示，在风格一致性、内容保留和表达质量上，平均得分为6.90，优于直接提示方法的6.70。

Conclusion: ZeroStylus展示了无需微调或并行语料库的长文本风格迁移新能力，验证了分层模板的必要性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge in long-text style transfer using
zero-shot learning of large language models (LLMs), proposing a hierarchical
framework that combines sentence-level stylistic adaptation with
paragraph-level structural coherence. We argue that in the process of effective
paragraph-style transfer, to preserve the consistency of original syntactic and
semantic information, it is essential to perform style transfer not only at the
sentence level but also to incorporate paragraph-level semantic considerations,
while ensuring structural coherence across inter-sentential relationships. Our
proposed framework, ZeroStylus, operates through two systematic phases:
hierarchical template acquisition from reference texts and template-guided
generation with multi-granular matching. The framework dynamically constructs
sentence and paragraph template repositories, enabling context-aware
transformations while preserving inter-sentence logical relationships.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baseline
methods, with structured rewriting achieving 6.90 average score compared to
6.70 for direct prompting approaches in tri-axial metrics assessing style
consistency, content preservation, and expression quality. Ablation studies
validate the necessity of both template hierarchies during style transfer,
showing higher content preservation win rate against sentence-only approaches
through paragraph-level structural encoding, as well as direct prompting method
through sentence-level pattern extraction and matching. The results establish
new capabilities for coherent long-text style transfer without requiring
parallel corpora or LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: BioProBench是一个评估LLM在生物协议理解与推理上的多任务基准，揭示了当前LLM在深层推理和结构化生成任务上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物协议对生命科学研究至关重要，但LLM在这类高专业性、准确性要求严格的程序性文本上的评估不足。

Method: 构建包含27K原始协议的BioProBench基准，涵盖五项核心任务（问答、排序、纠错、生成、推理），并评估12种主流LLM。

Result: LLM在表层理解任务表现较好，但在深层推理和结构化生成任务上显著不足；开源模型部分接近闭源水平，但生物专用小模型落后于通用LLM。

Conclusion: 生物协议的程序性推理对当前LLM仍是重大挑战，BioProBench为诊断局限性和开发更优AI系统提供了标准化框架。

Abstract: Biological protocols are fundamental to reproducible and safe life science
research. While LLMs excel on general tasks, their systematic evaluation on
these highly specialized, accuracy-critical, and inherently procedural texts
remains limited. In this work, we present BioProBench, the first large-scale,
integrated multi-task benchmark for biological protocol understanding and
reasoning. While limited benchmarks have touched upon specific aspects like
protocol QA, BioProBench provides a comprehensive suite of five core tasks:
Protocol Question Answering, Step Ordering, Error Correction, Protocol
Generation, and Protocol Reasoning, enabling a holistic evaluation of LLMs on
procedural biological texts. Built upon 27K original protocols, it yields
nearly 556K high-quality structured instances. We evaluate 12 mainstream
open/closed-source LLMs on BioProBench. Experimental results reveal that while
top models preform well on surface understanding tasks, struggle significantly
with deep reasoning and structured generation tasks like ordering and
generation. Furthermore, model comparisons reveal diverse performance: certain
open-source models approach closed-source levels on some tasks, yet
bio-specific small models lag behind general LLMs, indicating limitations on
complex procedural content. Overall, our findings underscore that procedural
reasoning within biological protocols represents a significant challenge for
current LLMs. BioProBench serves as a standardized framework to diagnose these
specific limitations and guide the development of AI systems better equipped
for safely automating complex scientific procedures. The code and data are

TL;DR: TSLFormer是一个轻量级、高效的土耳其手语识别模型，利用3D关节点数据，通过序列到序列的Transformer方法实现高性能手语识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者旨在开发一个轻量且鲁棒的土耳其手语识别系统，利用关节位置数据而非高维RGB/深度视频，以减少计算成本并适用于实时移动设备。

Method: 使用Mediapipe提取手部和躯干的3D关节位置作为输入，采用基于Transformer的序列到序列模型，利用自注意力机制捕捉手势序列的时序关联。

Result: 在包含36,000样本和227个单词的AUTSL数据集上，TSLFormer以低计算成本达到竞争性性能，验证了基于关节输入的实际应用潜力。

Conclusion: TSLFormer证明了关节数据足以支持高效实时的手语识别系统，为听力障碍者的辅助通信提供了可行的技术方案。

Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign
Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered,
string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only
works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's
Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This
creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important
semantic gesture information.
  Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence
translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the
success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses
the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence
within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words
unfold.
  Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different
words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational
cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling
real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired
individuals.

TL;DR: TrumorGPT是一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）和语义健康知识图谱的新型AI解决方案，旨在通过图检索增强生成（GraphRAG）技术进行健康领域的事实核查，区分真实谣言（trumors）与非事实信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展导致虚假信息泛滥，尤其在健康领域形成了信息疫情（infodemics），对公众构成严重威胁，亟需一种工具来区分真实谣言与虚假信息。

Method: TrumorGPT利用LLM和少样本学习构建语义健康知识图谱，并通过GraphRAG技术动态更新图谱数据，避免传统LLM的幻觉问题，实现精准的事实核查。

Result: 基于大规模健康数据集的实验表明，TrumorGPT在公共卫生声明的事实核查中表现优异，显著提升了信息准确性和信任度。

Conclusion: TrumorGPT为应对健康领域的信息疫情提供了高效工具，通过动态更新的知识图谱和先进AI技术增强了事实核查的能力。

Abstract: In the age of social media, the rapid spread of misinformation and rumors has
led to the emergence of infodemics, where false information poses a significant
threat to society. To combat this issue, we introduce TrumorGPT , a novel
generative artificial intelligence solution designed for fact-checking in the
health domain. TrumorGPT aims to distinguish "trumors", which are
health-related rumors that turn out to be true, providing a crucial tool in
differentiating between mere speculation and verified facts. This framework
leverages a large language model (LLM) with few-shot learning for semantic
health knowledge graph construction and semantic reasoning. TrumorGPT
incorporates graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) to address
the hallucination issue common in LLMs and the limitations of static training
data. GraphRAG involves accessing and utilizing information from regularly
updated semantic health knowledge graphs that consist of the latest medical
news and health information, ensuring that fact-checking by TrumorGPT is based
on the most recent data. Evaluating with extensive healthcare datasets,
TrumorGPT demonstrates superior performance in fact-checking for public health
claims. Its ability to effectively conduct fact-checking across various
platforms marks a critical step forward in the fight against health-related
misinformation, enhancing trust and accuracy in the digital information age.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型上下文长度快速增长，构建真实的长上下文基准变得困难，需要找到能测试长上下文模型能力的现实任务。

Method: 通过从GitHub问题中提取数据，构建了长上下文问答（LongCodeQA）和代码修复（LongSWE-Bench）任务，并分层设计基准复杂度。

Result: 实验发现，所有模型在长上下文场景下表现均不佳，如Claude 3.5 Sonnet性能从29%降至3%，Qwen2.5从70.2%降至40%。

Conclusion: 长上下文仍是当前模型的弱点，需要进一步优化模型在长上下文任务中的能力。

Abstract: Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of
tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context
models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks --
not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in
identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify
code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for
long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM
coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the
comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important
settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA
(LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the
complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different
scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model.
We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance
drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for
Qwen2.5.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列编辑方法在长期编辑后成功率显著下降，因模型输出逐渐偏离目标，即叠加噪声累积问题。

Method: 提出DeltaEdit，采用动态正交约束策略优化更新参数，减少编辑间的干扰。

Result: 实验表明DeltaEdit在编辑成功率和泛化能力保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeltaEdit能在大规模序列编辑下保持模型性能稳定可靠。

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing techniques aim to continuously update the
knowledge in large language models at a low cost, preventing the models from
generating outdated or incorrect information. However, existing sequential
editing methods suffer from a significant decline in editing success rates
after long-term editing. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we
identify that as the number of edits increases, the model's output increasingly
deviates from the desired target, leading to a drop in editing success rates.
We refer to this issue as the accumulation of superimposed noise problem. To
address this, we identify the factors contributing to this deviation and
propose DeltaEdit, a novel method that optimizes update parameters through a
dynamic orthogonal constraints strategy, effectively reducing interference
between edits to mitigate deviation. Experimental results demonstrate that
DeltaEdit significantly outperforms existing methods in edit success rates and
the retention of generalization capabilities, ensuring stable and reliable
model performance even under extensive sequential editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法常导致LLMs冗余搜索行为，造成效率和成本问题。需要一种方法能智能判断何时依赖内部知识，何时调用外部搜索。

Method: 结合MuSiQue和MMLU构建数据集，设计结构化推理模板，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO)后训练模型，奖励函数鼓励精准回答并减少不必要搜索。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少冗余搜索操作，同时在多个挑战性基准测试中保持或提高答案准确性。

Conclusion: SEM框架提升了LLMs的推理效率，并扩展了其智能利用外部知识的能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated their
capabilities not only in reasoning but also in invoking external tools,
particularly search engines. However, teaching models to discern when to invoke
search and when to rely on their internal knowledge remains a significant
challenge. Existing reinforcement learning approaches often lead to redundant
search behaviors, resulting in inefficiencies and over-cost. In this paper, we
propose SEM, a novel post-training reinforcement learning framework that
explicitly trains LLMs to optimize search usage. By constructing a balanced
dataset combining MuSiQue and MMLU, we create scenarios where the model must
learn to distinguish between questions it can answer directly and those
requiring external retrieval. We design a structured reasoning template and
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) to post-train the model's
search behaviors. Our reward function encourages accurate answering without
unnecessary search while promoting effective retrieval when needed.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces
redundant search operations while maintaining or improving answer accuracy
across multiple challenging benchmarks. This framework advances the model's
reasoning efficiency and extends its capability to judiciously leverage
external knowledge.

Result: Re^2是最大的一致性保障同行评审与反驳数据集，支持传统静态任务和动态LLM助手开发。

Conclusion: Re^2数据集为作者和评审提供了实用工具，有望缓解评审压力并提升科研效率。

Abstract: Peer review is a critical component of scientific progress in the fields like
AI, but the rapid increase in submission volume has strained the reviewing
system, which inevitably leads to reviewer shortages and declines review
quality. Besides the growing research popularity, another key factor in this
overload is the repeated resubmission of substandard manuscripts, largely due
to the lack of effective tools for authors to self-evaluate their work before
submission. Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in assisting both
authors and reviewers, and their performance is fundamentally limited by the
quality of the peer review data. However, existing peer review datasets face
three major limitations: (1) limited data diversity, (2) inconsistent and
low-quality data due to the use of revised rather than initial submissions, and
(3) insufficient support for tasks involving rebuttal and reviewer-author
interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce the largest
consistency-ensured peer review and rebuttal dataset named Re^2, which
comprises 19,926 initial submissions, 70,668 review comments, and 53,818
rebuttals from 24 conferences and 21 workshops on OpenReview. Moreover, the
rebuttal and discussion stage is framed as a multi-turn conversation paradigm
to support both traditional static review tasks and dynamic interactive LLM
assistants, providing more practical guidance for authors to refine their
manuscripts and helping alleviate the growing review burden. Our data and code
are available in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ReviewBench_anon/.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential in the field of health
care, yet they face great challenges in adapting to rapidly evolving medical
knowledge. This can lead to outdated or contradictory treatment suggestions.
This study investigated how LLMs respond to evolving clinical guidelines,
focusing on concept drift and internal inconsistencies. We developed the
DriftMedQA benchmark to simulate guideline evolution and assessed the temporal
reliability of various LLMs. Our evaluation of seven state-of-the-art models
across 4,290 scenarios demonstrated difficulties in rejecting outdated
recommendations and frequently endorsing conflicting guidance. Additionally, we
explored two mitigation strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and
preference fine-tuning via Direct Preference Optimization. While each method
improved model performance, their combination led to the most consistent and
reliable results. These findings underscore the need to improve LLM robustness
to temporal shifts to ensure more dependable applications in clinical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络通信以比特传输为核心，难以高效适应多样化的下游任务需求。语义通信通过在发送端传递语义信息而非原始数据，可提升带宽效率。然而，如何根据任务动态调整语义传递仍是一大挑战。

Method: 提出基于扩散模型的框架：1）发送端传输深度压缩的通用语义表示；2）接收端生成任务需求提示作为反馈；3）发送端结合注意力机制动态调整语义传输细节，以对齐任务目标。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在自适应保留任务关键信息的同时，保持了高压缩效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为语义通信提供了一种动态任务适配的新思路，兼顾信息效率与任务性能。

Abstract: Semantic communications represent a new paradigm of next-generation
networking that shifts bit-wise data delivery to conveying the semantic
meanings for bandwidth efficiency. To effectively accommodate various potential
downstream tasks at the receiver side, one should adaptively convey the most
critical semantic information. This work presents a novel task-adaptive
semantic communication framework based on diffusion models that is capable of
dynamically adjusting the semantic message delivery according to various
downstream tasks. Specifically, we initialize the transmission of a
deep-compressed general semantic representation from the transmitter to enable
diffusion-based coarse data reconstruction at the receiver. The receiver
identifies the task-specific demands and generates textual prompts as feedback.
Integrated with the attention mechanism, the transmitter updates the semantic
transmission with more details to better align with the objectives of the
intended receivers. Our test results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in adaptively preserving critical task-relevant information for semantic
communications while preserving high compression efficiency.

### [28] [Large Language Models and Arabic Content: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08004)
*Haneh Rhel,Dmitri Roussinov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文概述了过去三年大语言模型（LLMs）在阿拉伯语自然语言处理（NLP）中的应用，强调其挑战、技术改进和未来趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语资源稀缺且语言复杂，研究旨在探索LLMs如何应对这些挑战并提升阿拉伯语NLP任务的表现。

Method: 回顾早期预训练阿拉伯语模型，分析微调（finetuning）和提示工程（prompt engineering）等技术对模型性能的提升。

Result: 预训练的多语言LLMs在阿拉伯语NLP任务中表现优异，技术改进（如微调）进一步提高了模型效果。

Conclusion: LLMs在阿拉伯语NLP中应用前景广阔，但需更多资源和工具支持以应对语言复杂性。

Abstract: Over the past three years, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has had a profound impact on multiple areas of Artificial Intelligence
(AI), particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) across diverse
languages, including Arabic. Although Arabic is considered one of the most
widely spoken languages across 27 countries in the Arabic world and used as a
second language in some other non-Arabic countries as well, there is still a
scarcity of Arabic resources, datasets, and tools. Arabic NLP tasks face
various challenges due to the complexities of the Arabic language, including
its rich morphology, intricate structure, and diverse writing standards, among
other factors. Researchers have been actively addressing these challenges,
demonstrating that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on
multilingual corpora achieve significant success in various Arabic NLP tasks.
This study provides an overview of using large language models (LLMs) for the
Arabic language, highlighting early pre-trained Arabic Language models across
various NLP applications and their ability to handle diverse Arabic content
tasks and dialects. It also provides an overview of how techniques like
finetuning and prompt engineering can enhance the performance of these models.
Additionally, the study summarizes common Arabic benchmarks and datasets while
presenting our observations on the persistent upward trend in the adoption of
LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多层级藏文拼写纠错方法TiSpell，结合字符和音节级纠错，并通过数据增强生成多层级错误数据，验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注单一层级纠错且缺乏有效整合，同时藏文领域缺少开源数据集和针对性的数据增强方法，亟需解决这些问题。

Method: 提出基于无标注文本的数据增强生成多层级错误数据，并设计半掩码模型TiSpell，支持字符和音节级联合纠错。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上，TiSpell超越基线模型，性能媲美最先进方法。

Conclusion: TiSpell通过半掩码策略简化音节级纠错，结合合成数据集验证了多层级纠错的高效性。

Abstract: Multi-level Tibetan spelling correction addresses errors at both the
character and syllable levels within a unified model. Existing methods focus
mainly on single-level correction and lack effective integration of both
levels. Moreover, there are no open-source datasets or augmentation methods
tailored for this task in Tibetan. To tackle this, we propose a data
augmentation approach using unlabeled text to generate multi-level corruptions,
and introduce TiSpell, a semi-masked model capable of correcting both
character- and syllable-level errors. Although syllable-level correction is
more challenging due to its reliance on global context, our semi-masked
strategy simplifies this process. We synthesize nine types of corruptions on
clean sentences to create a robust training set. Experiments on both simulated
and real-world data demonstrate that TiSpell, trained on our dataset,
outperforms baseline models and matches the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches, confirming its effectiveness.

*Zhehao Zhang,Weijie Xu,Fanyou Wu,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究团队提出FalseReject数据集和框架，旨在减少LLMs过度拒绝安全查询的问题，并通过对抗多智能体交互生成多样化提示。实验表明其方法显著减少不必要的拒绝，同时保持安全性和语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs安全对齐方法常导致对无害查询的过度拒绝，影响其实用性。目标是解决这一挑战，提升模型在敏感场景中的表现。

Method: 提出FalseReject数据集（16k查询+结构化响应）和图引导的对抗多智能体交互框架，生成多样提示并结构化响应以区分安全上下文。

Result: 在29个SOTA LLMs上测试显示，FalseReject显著降低不必要的拒绝，且不影响安全性和语言能力。

Conclusion: FalseReject为LLMs提供了一种有效减少过度拒绝的方法，平衡安全性与实用性。

Abstract: Safety alignment approaches in large language models (LLMs) often lead to the
over-refusal of benign queries, significantly diminishing their utility in
sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce FalseReject, a
comprehensive resource containing 16k seemingly toxic queries accompanied by
structured responses across 44 safety-related categories. We propose a
graph-informed adversarial multi-agent interaction framework to generate
diverse and complex prompts, while structuring responses with explicit
reasoning to aid models in accurately distinguishing safe from unsafe contexts.
FalseReject includes training datasets tailored for both standard
instruction-tuned models and reasoning-oriented models, as well as a
human-annotated benchmark test set. Our extensive benchmarking on 29
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals persistent over-refusal challenges.
Empirical results demonstrate that supervised finetuning with FalseReject
substantially reduces unnecessary refusals without compromising overall safety
or general language capabilities.

and how the detail granularity is controllable. We discuss benchmark results
over open source data (i.e. Bram Stoker's Dracula available through Project
Gutenberg) and show how our results hold at the paragraph level, across
multiple genres and models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）是否能够模拟人类伦理推理，通过引入一个包含196个真实伦理困境的基准数据集，评估了多个前沿LLMs的表现。结果表明，LLMs在词汇和结构对齐上优于非专家人类，但在历史背景和复杂解决策略上表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否能够模拟人类伦理推理，并作为人类判断的可信代理。通过比较LLMs与非专家人类的反应，揭示其在伦理决策中的优势和局限。

Method: 引入包含196个伦理困境的基准数据集，评估多个LLMs（如GPT-4o-mini等），使用基于BLEU、Damerau-Levenshtein距离、TF-IDF余弦相似度和通用句子编码器相似度的复合度量框架。

Result: LLMs在词汇和结构对齐上优于非专家人类，GPT-4o-mini表现最稳定，但所有模型在历史背景和复杂解决策略上表现不佳。人类反应虽缺乏结构，但在语义相似度上偶尔表现相当。

Conclusion: LLMs在伦理决策中展现出潜力，但在历史背景和复杂策略上仍需改进。人类直觉推理在某些情况下仍具优势。

Abstract: One open question in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether
they can emulate human ethical reasoning and act as believable proxies for
human judgment. To investigate this, we introduce a benchmark dataset
comprising 196 real-world ethical dilemmas and expert opinions, each segmented
into five structured components: Introduction, Key Factors, Historical
Theoretical Perspectives, Resolution Strategies, and Key Takeaways. We also
collect non-expert human responses for comparison, limited to the Key Factors
section due to their brevity. We evaluate multiple frontier LLMs (GPT-4o-mini,
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Deepseek-V3, Gemini-1.5-Flash) using a composite metric
framework based on BLEU, Damerau-Levenshtein distance, TF-IDF cosine
similarity, and Universal Sentence Encoder similarity. Metric weights are
computed through an inversion-based ranking alignment and pairwise AHP
analysis, enabling fine-grained comparison of model outputs to expert
responses. Our results show that LLMs generally outperform non-expert humans in
lexical and structural alignment, with GPT-4o-mini performing most consistently
across all sections. However, all models struggle with historical grounding and
proposing nuanced resolution strategies, which require contextual abstraction.
Human responses, while less structured, occasionally achieve comparable
semantic similarity, suggesting intuitive moral reasoning. These findings
highlight both the strengths and current limitations of LLMs in ethical
decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在SWE-bench任务中，仅使用长上下文语言模型（LCLM）并适当提示，无需复杂架构，即可达到与精心调校的代理架构相当的性能。Gemini-1.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Pro的测试结果验证了这一发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在复杂任务中，语言模型代理架构的复杂性是否必要，是否能通过简化架构达成类似效果。

Method: 使用长上下文语言模型（LCLM）直接处理任务，无需额外工具或代理架构。对比测试Gemini-1.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Pro的表现。

Result: Gemini-1.5-Pro无架构支持达到38%的解决率，与复杂架构（32%）相当；Gemini-2.5-Pro达到50.8%；结合Gemini-1.5-Pro与Claude-3.7达到48.6%。

Conclusion: 简化架构在部分任务中表现优异，模型能力提升是关键因素，复杂架构并非绝对必要。

Abstract: Recent advances in language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant
potential for automating complex real-world tasks. To make progress on these
difficult tasks, LM agent architectures have become increasingly complex, often
incorporating multi-step retrieval tools, multiple agents, and scaffolding
adapted to the underlying LM. In this work, we investigate whether all of this
complexity is necessary, or if parts of these scaffolds can be removed on
challenging tasks like SWE-bench. We show that in the case of SWE-bench, simply
putting the entire environment into the context of a long context language
model (LCLM) and properly prompting the model makes it competitive with
carefully tuned, complex agent scaffolds. We show that a Gemini-1.5-Pro model
without any scaffolding or tools achieves 38% on SWE-Bench-Verified, comparable
with approaches using carefully tuned agent scaffolds (32%). While the
unscaffolded approach with Gemini-1.5-Pro falls short of the strongest agentic
architectures, we demonstrate that the more capable Gemini-2.5-Pro using the
same unscaffolded approach directly attains a 50.8% solve rate. Additionally, a
two-stage approach combining Gemini-1.5-Pro with Claude-3.7 achieves a
competitive 48.6% solve rate.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了ALOHA系统，一个为大学定向设计的、通过层次检索增强的多语言代理，它在处理校园特定信息的需求上超越了商业聊天机器人和搜索引擎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在缺乏领域特定知识及搜索引擎在多语言和实时场景支持上的局限性，满足师生对校园特定信息的需求。

Method: 提出了ALOHA系统，一种利用层次检索增强的多语言代理，并将外部API集成至前端界面以提供交互式服务。

Result: 人评估和案例研究表明，ALOHA在多种语言环境下能够提供准确、及时、用户友好的回答，服务已部署并覆盖超过12000人。

Conclusion: ALOHA系统在多语言校园信息检索方面表现优异，超越了现有商业解决方案，并已成功服务于大规模用户群体。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models~(LLMs) revolutionizes information
retrieval, allowing users to obtain required answers through complex
instructions within conversations. However, publicly available services remain
inadequate in addressing the needs of faculty and students to search
campus-specific information. It is primarily due to the LLM's lack of
domain-specific knowledge and the limitation of search engines in supporting
multilingual and timely scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
ALOHA, a multilingual agent enhanced by hierarchical retrieval for university
orientation. We also integrate external APIs into the front-end interface to
provide interactive service. The human evaluation and case study show our
proposed system has strong capabilities to yield correct, timely, and
user-friendly responses to the queries in multiple languages, surpassing
commercial chatbots and search engines. The system has been deployed and has
provided service for more than 12,000 people.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双向思维链和奖励机制的新训练方法，用于解决领域特定大模型（如ICH-Qwen）在微调时面临的偏见、知识继承错误和灾难性遗忘问题，实验证明在多个领域数据集上优于现有方法。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在大模型微调时存在偏见、知识继承错误和灾难性遗忘等问题，尤其是像非物质文化遗产这样的特定领域数据。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了新的训练方法，提高模型的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种结合双向思维链（前向推理和反向提问/推理）和奖励机制的训练方法，通过结构化和内容评估优化模型决策与输出质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在问答任务中的准确率、Bleu-4和Rouge-L分数上优于0-shot、逐步推理、知识蒸馏和问题增强等方法，且在多个领域（如金融、Wikidata、StrategyQA）表现出泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法的双向思维链与奖励机制结合不仅提升了模型性能，还具有跨领域适用性，为未来多样化领域的模型训练提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided
significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific
LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural
Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect
knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of
thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large
language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural
heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward
reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing
reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent
knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to
optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of
the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different
weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results
demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning,
knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy,
Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the
paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of
thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a
series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that
the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and
advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This
demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a
valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse
fields.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了文本语义增强（TSA）方法，通过增加文本语义监督信号来提高文本属性图（TAG）上少样本和零样本节点分类的准确性。TSA设计了正语义匹配和负语义对比两种技术，实验表明其在5个数据集上优于13种现有方法，准确率提升通常超过5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本属性图（TAG）中，少样本和零样本节点分类具有重要应用，但现有方法主要依赖图增强技术，而文本增强技术未被充分探索。因此，论文旨在通过文本语义增强（TSA）弥补这一不足。

Method: TSA设计了正语义匹配（检索相似文本）和负语义对比（构造相反语义文本）两种技术，为每个节点提供更多参考文本，从而增强语义监督信号。

Result: 在5个数据集和13种基线方法的对比中，TSA始终表现最佳，准确率通常比最优基线提升5%以上。

Conclusion: TSA通过文本语义增强有效提升了TAG上的节点分类性能，证明了文本增强技术在少样本和零样本任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Text-attributed graph (TAG) provides a text description for each graph node,
and few- and zero-shot node classification on TAGs have many applications in
fields such as academia and social networks. Existing work utilizes various
graph-based augmentation techniques to train the node and text embeddings,
while text-based augmentations are largely unexplored. In this paper, we
propose Text Semantics Augmentation (TSA) to improve accuracy by introducing
more text semantic supervision signals. Specifically, we design two
augmentation techniques, i.e., positive semantics matching and negative
semantics contrast, to provide more reference texts for each graph node or text
description. Positive semantic matching retrieves texts with similar embeddings
to match with a graph node. Negative semantic contrast adds a negative prompt
to construct a text description with the opposite semantics, which is
contrasted with the original node and text. We evaluate TSA on 5 datasets and
compare with 13 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that TSA
consistently outperforms all baselines, and its accuracy improvements over the
best-performing baseline are usually over 5%.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了预训练的不确定性量化（UQ）头，用于增强大型语言模型（LLMs）对幻觉（生成虚假信息）的检测能力，并通过实验验证了其高鲁棒性和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成内容时可能产生难以检测的幻觉（虚假信息），传统无监督UQ方法效果有限，因此需要更有效的工具来量化模型输出的不确定性。

Method: 研究设计了监督辅助模块（预训练的UQ头），利用Transformer架构和LLM注意力图提取的特征，提升不确定性量化能力。

Result: 实验表明，UQ头在域内和域外prompt的幻觉检测中均达到最优性能，且能泛化到未训练的语言中。

Conclusion: 预训练的UQ头为LLMs的可靠性评估提供了高效工具，其代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the tendency to hallucinate, i.e., to
sporadically generate false or fabricated information. This presents a major
challenge, as hallucinations often appear highly convincing and users generally
lack the tools to detect them. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides a
framework for assessing the reliability of model outputs, aiding in the
identification of potential hallucinations. In this work, we introduce
pre-trained UQ heads: supervised auxiliary modules for LLMs that substantially
enhance their ability to capture uncertainty compared to unsupervised UQ
methods. Their strong performance stems from the powerful Transformer
architecture in their design and informative features derived from LLM
attention maps. Experimental evaluation shows that these heads are highly
robust and achieve state-of-the-art performance in claim-level hallucination
detection across both in-domain and out-of-domain prompts. Moreover, these
modules demonstrate strong generalization to languages they were not explicitly
trained on. We pre-train a collection of UQ heads for popular LLM series,
including Mistral, Llama, and Gemma 2. We publicly release both the code and
the pre-trained heads.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced
traditional evaluation methodologies. It presents novel challenges, such as
measuring human-like psychological constructs, navigating beyond static and
task-specific benchmarks, and establishing human-centered evaluation. These
challenges intersect with Psychometrics, the science of quantifying the
intangible aspects of human psychology, such as personality, values, and
intelligence. This survey introduces and synthesizes an emerging
interdisciplinary field of LLM Psychometrics, which leverages psychometric
instruments, theories, and principles to evaluate, understand, and enhance
LLMs. We systematically explore the role of Psychometrics in shaping
benchmarking principles, broadening evaluation scopes, refining methodologies,
validating results, and advancing LLM capabilities. This paper integrates
diverse perspectives to provide a structured framework for researchers across
disciplines, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of this nascent field.
Ultimately, we aim to provide actionable insights for developing future
evaluation paradigms that align with human-level AI and promote the advancement
of human-centered AI systems for societal benefit. A curated repository of LLM

Result: 实验表明，所提方法能显著提升扩展性、优化效率，并在多跳推理任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ACC和混合CAG-RAG框架为知识密集型任务提供了高效的解决方案，尤其在动态知识库场景下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for
novel approaches in knowledge-intensive tasks. Among these, Cache-Augmented
Generation (CAG) has emerged as a promising alternative to Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). CAG minimizes retrieval latency and simplifies system design
by preloading knowledge into the model's context. However, challenges persist
in scaling CAG to accommodate large and dynamic knowledge bases effectively.
This paper introduces Adaptive Contextual Compression (ACC), an innovative
technique designed to dynamically compress and manage context inputs, enabling
efficient utilization of the extended memory capabilities of modern LLMs. To
further address the limitations of standalone CAG, we propose a Hybrid CAG-RAG
Framework, which integrates selective retrieval to augment preloaded contexts
in scenarios requiring additional information. Comprehensive evaluations on
diverse datasets highlight the proposed methods' ability to enhance
scalability, optimize efficiency, and improve multi-hop reasoning performance,
offering practical solutions for real-world knowledge integration challenges.

Motivation: 探究黑盒提示优化方法是否适用于超大规模语言模型，以及模型规模对优化效果的影响。

Method: 选用三种黑盒优化方法，在不同规模的LLM（如Qwen 2.5系列）和数据集上进行实验。

Result: 黑盒优化在大模型上效果有限，且模型规模越大优化效益越低，呈现逆缩放规律。

Conclusion: 模型规模是影响黑盒提示优化效果的关键因素，未来研究需针对超大规模模型设计新方法。

Abstract: Black-Box prompt optimization methods have emerged as a promising strategy
for refining input prompts to better align large language models (LLMs),
thereby enhancing their task performance. Although these methods have
demonstrated encouraging results, most studies and experiments have primarily
focused on smaller-scale models (e.g., 7B, 14B) or earlier versions (e.g.,
GPT-3.5) of LLMs. As the scale of LLMs continues to increase, such as with
DeepSeek V3 (671B), it remains an open question whether these black-box
optimization techniques will continue to yield significant performance
improvements for models of such scale. In response to this, we select three
well-known black-box optimization methods and evaluate them on large-scale LLMs
(DeepSeek V3 and Gemini 2.0 Flash) across four NLU and NLG datasets. The
results show that these black-box prompt optimization methods offer only
limited improvements on these large-scale LLMs. Furthermore, we hypothesize
that the scale of the model is the primary factor contributing to the limited
benefits observed. To explore this hypothesis, we conducted experiments on LLMs
of varying sizes (Qwen 2.5 series, ranging from 7B to 72B) and observed an
inverse scaling law, wherein the effectiveness of black-box optimization
methods diminished as the model size increased.

### [42] [On the Geometry of Semantics in Next-token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08348)
*Yize Zhao,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了现代语言模型如何通过简单的下一个词预测（NTP）训练目标隐式学习语义和语法概念，发现SVD分解在编码语言结构中起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索尽管仅通过NTP目标训练，语言模型为何能有效捕捉语言意义，揭示其背后的隐含学习机制。

Method: 分析NTP优化如何隐式引导模型通过SVD分解中心化的数据稀疏矩阵来编码语义和语法概念，并利用谱聚类方法验证。

Result: 发现NTP训练会优先学习最重要的SVD因子，且词嵌入能有效分解该矩阵以捕捉语言结构，新提出的正交聚类方法也验证了这一点。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了NTP的隐含偏差如何塑造语言模型中语义表征的涌现，连接了分布语义、神经坍缩几何与训练动力学。

Abstract: Modern language models demonstrate a remarkable ability to capture linguistic
meaning despite being trained solely through next-token prediction (NTP). We
investigate how this conceptually simple training objective leads models to
extract and encode latent semantic and grammatical concepts. Our analysis
reveals that NTP optimization implicitly guides models to encode concepts via
singular value decomposition (SVD) factors of a centered data-sparsity matrix
that captures next-word co-occurrence patterns. While the model never
explicitly constructs this matrix, learned word and context embeddings
effectively factor it to capture linguistic structure. We find that the most
important SVD factors are learned first during training, motivating the use of
spectral clustering of embeddings to identify human-interpretable semantics,
including both classical k-means and a new orthant-based method directly
motivated by our interpretation of concepts. Overall, our work bridges
distributional semantics, neural collapse geometry, and neural network training
dynamics, providing insights into how NTP's implicit biases shape the emergence
of meaning representations in language models.

*Mina Almasi,Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）作为二语学习自适应辅导工具的潜力，通过系统提示约束LLM生成符合学生能力水平的文本，并发现提示方法在长期互动中存在限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLM能否通过系统提示可靠地生成符合学生语言水平的文本，以验证其作为自适应辅导工具的可行性。

Method: 方法包括使用7B至12B参数的开源LLM模拟西班牙语师生对话，通过CEFR-based提示控制文本难度，并评估提示效果。

Result: 结果显示系统提示能约束模型输出，但在长期互动中效果不稳定（对齐漂移）。研究提供了低成本评估模型性能的方法。

Conclusion: 结论是LLM可作为个性化自适应辅导工具，但仅依赖提示在长期互动中效果有限，需进一步改进。

Abstract: This paper investigates the potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
adaptive tutors in the context of second-language learning. In particular, we
evaluate whether system prompting can reliably constrain LLMs to generate only
text appropriate to the student's competence level. We simulate full
teacher-student dialogues in Spanish using instruction-tuned, open-source LLMs
ranging in size from 7B to 12B parameters. Dialogues are generated by having an
LLM alternate between tutor and student roles with separate chat histories. The
output from the tutor model is then used to evaluate the effectiveness of
CEFR-based prompting to control text difficulty across three proficiency levels
(A1, B1, C1). Our findings suggest that while system prompting can be used to
constrain model outputs, prompting alone is too brittle for sustained,
long-term interactional contexts - a phenomenon we term alignment drift. Our
results provide insights into the feasibility of LLMs for personalized,
proficiency-aligned adaptive tutors and provide a scalable method for low-cost
evaluation of model performance without human participants.

### [44] [Towards Contamination Resistant Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08389)
*Rahmatullah Musawi,Sheng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了‘抗污染’基准的概念，通过基于凯撒密码的简单但有效的基准测试，揭示了当前大语言模型（LLMs）在控制污染情况下的表现问题，为LLM评估提供了更严谨的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展需要更可靠的评估方法，而污染问题是当前评估中的主要挑战之一。论文旨在通过提出抗污染的评估方法，更准确地衡量LLMs的真实能力。

Method: 采用基于凯撒密码的基准测试（例如‘ab’在偏移量为1时转为‘bc’），以其简单性作为抗污染的范例，并在多种设置下测试广泛使用的LLMs。

Result: 研究发现，在控制污染的情况下，当前LLMs在这一基准上表现不佳，揭示了模型能力的局限性。

Conclusion: 论文为开发抗污染的LLM评估基准提供了重要贡献，有助于更严谨地评估模型，并深入理解LLMs的真实能力和限制。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing. Evaluating LLMs properly is crucial
for understanding their potential and addressing concerns such as safety.
However, LLM evaluation is confronted by various factors, among which
contamination stands out as a key issue that undermines the reliability of
evaluations. In this work, we introduce the concept of contamination resistance
to address this challenge. We propose a benchmark based on Caesar ciphers
(e.g., "ab" to "bc" when the shift is 1), which, despite its simplicity, is an
excellent example of a contamination resistant benchmark. We test this
benchmark on widely used LLMs under various settings, and we find that these
models struggle with this benchmark when contamination is controlled. Our
findings reveal issues in current LLMs and raise important questions regarding
their true capabilities. Our work contributes to the development of
contamination resistant benchmarks, enabling more rigorous LLM evaluation and
offering insights into the true capabilities and limitations of LLMs.

### [45] [Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: When Goal-Gradient Importance Meets Dynamic Skipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08392)
*Ren Zhuang,Ben Wang,Shuifa Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Adaptive GoGI-Skip框架，通过动态的目标导向压缩提升CoT提示的效率，减少45%以上token并加速推理1.6-2.0倍，同时保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT提示的推理轨迹冗长且低效，通用压缩方法可能误删关键token或无法适应不同复杂度。需动态、目标导向的压缩方案以权衡效率与准确性。

Method: 提出Adaptive GoGI-Skip框架：1) GoGI指标基于梯度影响量化token功能重要性；2) ADS机制根据模型不确定性动态调节压缩率，并约束局部连贯性。

Result: 在MATH等基准测试中，平均减少45%+ token，推理提速1.6-2.0倍，准确率优于基线，尤其在高压下仍保持性能。

Conclusion: 首次将梯度重要性指标与动态压缩结合，显著优化CoT效率-准确性权衡，推动大语言模型推理效率前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for complex
tasks, but their reasoning traces are often excessively verbose and
inefficient, leading to significant computational costs and latency. Current
CoT compression techniques typically rely on generic importance metrics and
static compression rates, which may inadvertently remove functionally critical
tokens or fail to adapt to varying reasoning complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Adaptive GoGI-Skip, a novel framework learning dynamic
CoT compression via supervised fine-tuning. This approach introduces two
synergistic innovations: (1) Goal-Gradient Importance (GoGI), a novel metric
accurately identifying functionally relevant tokens by measuring the gradient
influence of their intermediate representations on the final answer loss, and
(2) Adaptive Dynamic Skipping (ADS), a mechanism dynamically regulating the
compression rate based on runtime model uncertainty while ensuring local
coherence through an adaptive N-token constraint. To our knowledge, this is the
first work unifying a goal-oriented, gradient-based importance metric with
dynamic, uncertainty-aware skipping for CoT compression. Trained on compressed
MATH data, Adaptive GoGI-Skip demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization
across diverse reasoning benchmarks including AIME, GPQA, and GSM8K. It
achieves substantial efficiency gains - reducing CoT token counts by over 45%
on average and delivering 1.6-2.0 times inference speedups - while maintaining
high reasoning accuracy. Notably, it significantly outperforms existing
baselines by preserving accuracy even at high effective compression rates,
advancing the state of the art in the CoT reasoning efficiency-accuracy
trade-off.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TUMS框架，通过参数级处理提升大语言模型的工具使用能力，显著提高了在ToolQA基准上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在工具使用时因参数生成问题表现不佳，尤其是在非可执行或错误操作时。

Method: TUMS框架包含意图识别器、任务分解器、子任务处理器和执行器，实现从工具级到参数级的处理转变。

Result: 在ToolQA基准上，TUMS框架在简单和困难任务上分别平均提升19.6%和50.6%。

Conclusion: TUMS框架有效提升了大语言模型的工具使用能力，并通过消融实验验证了各模块的关键贡献。

Abstract: Recently, large language models(LLMs) have played an increasingly important
role in solving a wide range of NLP tasks, leveraging their capabilities of
natural language understanding and generating. Integration with external tools
further enhances LLMs' effectiveness, providing more precise, timely, and
specialized responses. However, LLMs still encounter difficulties with
non-executable actions and improper actions, which are primarily attributed to
incorrect parameters. The process of generating parameters by LLMs is confined
to the tool level, employing the coarse-grained strategy without considering
the different difficulties of various tools. To address this issue, we propose
TUMS, a novel framework designed to enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs
by transforming tool-level processing into parameter-level processing.
Specifically, our framework consists of four key components: (1) an intent
recognizer that identifies the user's intent to help LLMs better understand the
task; (2) a task decomposer that breaks down complex tasks into simpler
subtasks, each involving a tool call; (3) a subtask processor equipped with
multi-structure handlers to generate accurate parameters; and (4) an executor.
Our empirical studies have evidenced the effectiveness and efficiency of the
TUMS framework with an average of 19.6\% and 50.6\% improvement separately on
easy and hard benchmarks of ToolQA, meanwhile, we demonstrated the key
contribution of each part with ablation experiments, offering more insights and
stimulating future research on Tool-augmented LLMs.

Result: Hakim模型在FaMTEB基准测试中表现优越，准确性显著提高。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为波斯语语言理解的新发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text embedding have significantly improved natural
language understanding across many languages, yet Persian remains notably
underrepresented in large-scale embedding research. In this paper, we present
Hakim, a novel state-of-the-art Persian text embedding model that achieves a
8.5% performance improvement over existing approaches on the FaMTEB benchmark,
outperforming all previously developed Persian language models. As part of this
work, we introduce three new datasets - Corpesia, Pairsia-sup, and
Pairsia-unsup - to support supervised and unsupervised training scenarios.
Additionally, Hakim is designed for applications in chatbots and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, particularly addressing retrieval
tasks that require incorporating message history within these systems. We also
propose a new baseline model built on the BERT architecture. Our language model
consistently achieves higher accuracy across various Persian NLP tasks, while
the RetroMAE-based model proves particularly effective for textual information
retrieval applications. Together, these contributions establish a new
foundation for advancing Persian language understanding.

*Matteo Marulli,Glauco Panattoni,Marco Bertini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过开发一个文档处理流程，解决了意大利法律研究中缺乏公开数据集的问题，优化了主题建模的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 意大利法律研究中缺乏公开数据集，限制了最高法院判决中法律主题的分析，因此需要开发一个文档处理流程来生成匿名数据集。

Method: 采用文档布局分析（YOLOv8x）、光学字符识别和文本匿名化的技术流程，结合BERTopic进行主题提取，并利用大语言模型生成标签和摘要。

Result: 文档布局分析和OCR模块性能优异，数据集显著提升了主题建模的多样性（0.6198）和一致性（0.6638），Claude Sonnet 3.7在标签生成和摘要任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该流程有效解决了数据集缺失问题，提升了主题建模效果，展示了技术结合在法律研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Topic modeling in Italian legal research is hindered by the lack of public
datasets, limiting the analysis of legal themes in Supreme Court judgments. To
address this, we developed a document processing pipeline that produces an
anonymized dataset optimized for topic modeling.
  The pipeline integrates document layout analysis (YOLOv8x), optical character
recognition, and text anonymization. The DLA module achieved a mAP@50 of 0.964
and a mAP@50-95 of 0.800. The OCR detector reached a mAP@50-95 of 0.9022, and
the text recognizer (TrOCR) obtained a character error rate of 0.0047 and a
word error rate of 0.0248. Compared to OCR-only methods, our dataset improved
topic modeling with a diversity score of 0.6198 and a coherence score of
0.6638.
  We applied BERTopic to extract topics and used large language models to
generate labels and summaries. Outputs were evaluated against domain expert
interpretations. Claude Sonnet 3.7 achieved a BERTScore F1 of 0.8119 for
labeling and 0.9130 for summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IterKey是一个基于BM25的RAG改进框架，通过LLM驱动的迭代关键词生成增强检索，平衡了准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稠密检索方法准确性高但缺乏可解释性，而稀疏检索方法透明但难以捕捉查询完整意图。IterKey旨在通过迭代关键词优化解决这一问题。

Method: IterKey包含三个阶段：生成检索关键词、基于检索文档生成答案、答案验证。若验证失败，则迭代优化关键词。

Result: 在四个QA任务中，IterKey比BM25基线准确率提升5%-20%，性能接近稠密检索方法。

Conclusion: IterKey通过LLM迭代优化稀疏检索，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升RAG的准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a way to complement the
in-context knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external
documents. However, real-world applications demand not only accuracy but also
interpretability. While dense retrieval methods provide high accuracy, they
lack interpretability; conversely, sparse retrieval methods offer transparency
but often fail to capture the full intent of queries due to their reliance on
keyword matching. To address these issues, we introduce IterKey, an LLM-driven
iterative keyword generation framework that enhances RAG via sparse retrieval.
IterKey consists of three LLM-driven stages: generating keywords for retrieval,
generating answers based on retrieved documents, and validating the answers. If
validation fails, the process iteratively repeats with refined keywords. Across
four QA tasks, experimental results show that IterKey achieves 5% to 20%
accuracy improvements over BM25-based RAG and simple baselines. Its performance
is comparable to dense retrieval-based RAG and prior iterative query refinement
methods using dense models. In summary, IterKey is a novel BM25-based approach
leveraging LLMs to iteratively refine RAG, effectively balancing accuracy with
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PLMs在微调后仍存在编码器输出与解码器输入之间的表示不匹配问题，限制了模型性能。RepCali旨在通过校准潜在表示来解决这一问题。

Method: 在编码器后引入校准模块（RepCali），调整潜在空间表示，并直接作为解码器输入。该方法通用、即插即用且易于实现。

Result: 在25个PLM模型和8项任务（含中英文数据）的实验中，RepCali显著提升了性能，且在4项基准任务中优于代表性微调基线。

Conclusion: RepCali通过校准潜在表示有效解决了PLMs的表示不匹配问题，并显著提升了模型在下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) has become a dominant paradigm
in applying PLMs to downstream tasks. However, with limited fine-tuning, PLMs
still struggle with the discrepancies between the representation obtained from
the PLMs' encoder and the optimal input to the PLMs' decoder. This paper
tackles this challenge by learning to calibrate the representation of PLMs in
the latent space. In the proposed representation calibration method (RepCali),
we integrate a specific calibration block to the latent space after the encoder
and use the calibrated output as the decoder input. The merits of the proposed
RepCali include its universality to all PLMs with encoder-decoder
architectures, its plug-and-play nature, and ease of implementation. Extensive
experiments on 25 PLM-based models across 8 tasks (including both English and
Chinese datasets) demonstrate that the proposed RepCali offers desirable
enhancements to PLMs (including LLMs) and significantly improves the
performance of downstream tasks. Comparison experiments across 4 benchmark
tasks indicate that RepCali is superior to the representative fine-tuning
baselines.

Abstract: Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across
various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance
detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding,
cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these
progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches
that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical
gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection,
comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field,
including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and
emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection
approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods,
including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data
modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target
relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target
scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze
benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and
limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation
detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media
moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as
implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints,
while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance
reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our
survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to
guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance
detection systems powered by large language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉-语言模型评估过程昂贵且耗时，限制了实际应用。研究旨在探索低成本开源的LVLMs是否可作为自动评估工具。

Method: 设计了包括成对和单点评估任务，涵盖事实正确性、信息量和相关性等标准。还分析了模型在格式遵循、位置一致性、长度偏差等方面的表现。

Result: 实验显示，部分开源LVLMs评估性能接近GPT-4（80%一致性），但其他模型表现较差（低于10%一致性）。结果显示开源模型可作为低成本评估工具。

Conclusion: 开源LVLMs可作为图表任务的经济高效自动评估者，但仍存在如位置偏好和长度偏差等问题。

Abstract: Charts are ubiquitous as they help people understand and reason with data.
Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering,
chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly
and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges
to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline
evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access
to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial
settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source
LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design
both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual
correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM
judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and
instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters)
suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized
evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy.
Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges
achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4
judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that
state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic
evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference
and length bias persist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本AES方法依赖LLM直接生成绝对分数，但常因模型偏见和不一致评分与人工评分不符，亟需更精确且高效的解决方案。

Method: LCES将AES任务转化为成对比较问题，要求LLM判断两篇文章的优劣，并通过RankNet将比较结果高效转换为连续分数。

Result: 实验表明，LCES在AES基准数据集上比传统零样本方法更准确且计算高效，且在不同LLM模型上均表现稳健。

Conclusion: LCES为零样本AES提供了一种高精度、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled zero-shot
automated essay scoring (AES), providing a promising way to reduce the cost and
effort of essay scoring in comparison with manual grading. However, most
existing zero-shot approaches rely on LLMs to directly generate absolute
scores, which often diverge from human evaluations owing to model biases and
inconsistent scoring. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-based
Comparative Essay Scoring (LCES), a method that formulates AES as a pairwise
comparison task. Specifically, we instruct LLMs to judge which of two essays is
better, collect many such comparisons, and convert them into continuous scores.
Considering that the number of possible comparisons grows quadratically with
the number of essays, we improve scalability by employing RankNet to
efficiently transform LLM preferences into scalar scores. Experiments using AES
benchmark datasets show that LCES outperforms conventional zero-shot methods in
accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, LCES is robust
across different LLM backbones, highlighting its applicability to real-world
zero-shot AES.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于三元组的线性化方法以替代Penman编码，解决其处理深层图和节点重入时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Penman编码在处理深层AMR图时，相关节点可能在文本中相距较远，且需通过反向角色处理节点重入，增加了关系类型的预测负担。

Method: 提出了一种基于三元组的线性化方法，并与Penman编码进行效率对比。

Result: 三元组方法虽适合表示图结构，但在表达嵌套图结构的简洁性和明确性上仍需改进以媲美Penman编码。

Conclusion: 三元组线性化方法具有一定潜力，但需进一步优化以更好地表示嵌套图结构。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models are widely used to train Abstract Meaning
Representation (Banarescu et al., 2013, AMR) parsers. To train such models, AMR
graphs have to be linearized into a one-line text format. While Penman encoding
is typically used for this purpose, we argue that it has limitations: (1) for
deep graphs, some closely related nodes are located far apart in the linearized
text (2) Penman's tree-based encoding necessitates inverse roles to handle node
re-entrancy, doubling the number of relation types to predict. To address these
issues, we propose a triple-based linearization method and compare its
efficiency with Penman linearization. Although triples are well suited to
represent a graph, our results suggest room for improvement in triple encoding
to better compete with Penman's concise and explicit representation of a nested
graph structure.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的评估指标Minimal Pair Accuracy (MPA)，用于衡量NMT系统对性别线索的依赖程度，发现模型倾向于忽略性别线索而采用统计性别刻板印象，且在反刻板情况下更关注男性线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NMT系统的性别偏见问题虽受关注，但传统评估指标未能充分捕捉模型对上下文性别线索的利用情况，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出MPA指标，通过最小对（仅性别代词差异的句子对）评估模型对性别线索的依赖，并在英语-意大利语NMT模型上验证。

Result: 模型多数情况忽略性别线索，依赖统计刻板印象；反刻板情况下更关注男性线索；编码器中男性线索引发分散响应，女性线索引发集中响应。

Conclusion: MPA揭示了NMT系统性别偏见的复杂性，需改进模型对性别线索的利用，尤其是女性线索的处理。

Abstract: While gender bias in modern Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems has
received much attention, traditional evaluation metrics do not to fully capture
the extent to which these systems integrate contextual gender cues. We propose
a novel evaluation metric called Minimal Pair Accuracy (MPA), which measures
the reliance of models on gender cues for gender disambiguation. MPA is
designed to go beyond surface-level gender accuracy metrics by focusing on
whether models adapt to gender cues in minimal pairs -- sentence pairs that
differ solely in the gendered pronoun, namely the explicit indicator of the
target's entity gender in the source language (EN). We evaluate a number of NMT
models on the English-Italian (EN--IT) language pair using this metric, we show
that they ignore available gender cues in most cases in favor of (statistical)
stereotypical gender interpretation. We further show that in anti-stereotypical
cases, these models tend to more consistently take masculine gender cues into
account while ignoring the feminine cues. Furthermore, we analyze the attention
head weights in the encoder component and show that while all models encode
gender information to some extent, masculine cues elicit a more diffused
response compared to the more concentrated and specialized responses to
feminine gender cues.

### [56] [Small but Significant: On the Promise of Small Language Models for Accessible AIED](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08588)
*Yumou Wei,Paulo Carvalho,John Stamper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出，尽管GPT等大型语言模型（LLMs）在教育领域广受欢迎，但资源密集型的LLMs可能忽视了小型语言模型（SLMs）的潜力，尤其是在资源有限的机构中。通过KC发现的实验证明，如Phi-2这样的SLMs可以高效解决问题，无需复杂提示策略，呼吁更多关注SLM-based的AIED研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者认为，当前AIED领域过于关注GPT等资源密集型LLMs，可能忽视了SLMs在资源受限环境下提供高质量、经济实惠的AI工具的能力。

Method: 通过实验验证SLMs（如Phi-2）在知识组件（KC）发现任务中的表现，展示其无需复杂提示策略即可高效解决问题的潜力。

Result: 实验结果显示，SLMs（如Phi-2）可以在KC发现任务中表现优异，支持其在资源受限场景中的应用价值。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁AIED领域应更多关注SLMs的研究与应用，以实现更加公平且经济的AI教育工具普及。

Abstract: GPT has become nearly synonymous with large language models (LLMs), an
increasingly popular term in AIED proceedings. A simple keyword-based search
reveals that 61% of the 76 long and short papers presented at AIED 2024
describe novel solutions using LLMs to address some of the long-standing
challenges in education, and 43% specifically mention GPT. Although LLMs
pioneered by GPT create exciting opportunities to strengthen the impact of AI
on education, we argue that the field's predominant focus on GPT and other
resource-intensive LLMs (with more than 10B parameters) risks neglecting the
potential impact that small language models (SLMs) can make in providing
resource-constrained institutions with equitable and affordable access to
high-quality AI tools. Supported by positive results on knowledge component
(KC) discovery, a critical challenge in AIED, we demonstrate that SLMs such as
Phi-2 can produce an effective solution without elaborate prompting strategies.
Hence, we call for more attention to developing SLM-based AIED approaches.

Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming pathology by
integrat-ing large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and domain-specific foundation models. This study explores the
application of RAG-enhanced LLMs coupled with pathology foundation models for
thyroid cytology diagnosis, addressing challenges in cytological
interpretation, standardization, and diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging a
curated knowledge base, RAG facilitates dy-namic retrieval of relevant case
studies, diagnostic criteria, and expert interpreta-tion, improving the
contextual understanding of LLMs. Meanwhile, pathology foun-dation models,
trained on high-resolution pathology images, refine feature extrac-tion and
classification capabilities. The fusion of these AI-driven approaches en-hances
diagnostic consistency, reduces variability, and supports pathologists in
dis-tinguishing benign from malignant thyroid lesions. Our results demonstrate
that integrating RAG with pathology-specific LLMs significantly improves
diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, paving the way for AI-assisted
thyroid cytopathology, with foundation model UNI achieving AUC 0.73-0.93 for
correct prediction of surgi-cal pathology diagnosis from thyroid cytology
samples.

Conclusion: 所提出的算法有效解决了推测解码中的效率与准确性权衡问题，显著提升了LLM在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding, which combines a draft model with a target model, has
emerged as an effective approach to accelerate large language model (LLM)
inference. However, existing methods often face a trade-off between the
acceptance rate and decoding speed in downstream tasks due to the limited
capacity of the draft model, making it difficult to ensure efficiency across
diverse tasks. To address this problem, we propose a speculative decoding
algorithm tailored for downstream task optimization. It includes an automatic
task partitioning and assigning method, which automatically categorizes
downstream tasks into different sub-tasks and assigns them to a set of
heterogeneous draft models. Each draft model is aligned with the target model
using task-specific data, thereby enhancing the consistency of inference
results. In addition, our proposed method incorporates an online lightweight
prompt classifier to dynamically route prompts to the appropriate draft model.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves draft
accuracy by 6% to 50% over vanilla speculative decoding, while achieving a
speedup of 1.10x to 2.64x in LLM inference.

Motivation: 探讨LLM隐藏状态是否比其文本输出更能捕获经济信息，以提升统计数据估计的准确性。

Method: 使用开源LLM的隐藏状态训练简单线性模型，提出无需目标变量标注数据的迁移学习方法。

Result: 隐藏状态在县和公司级别变量上表现更优，少量标注样本即可训练，迁移学习提升了估计精度。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态在经济任务中具有实用价值，可用于超分辨率和数据填补。

Abstract: We investigate whether the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can
be used to estimate and impute economic and financial statistics. Focusing on
county-level (e.g. unemployment) and firm-level (e.g. total assets) variables,
we show that a simple linear model trained on the hidden states of open-source
LLMs outperforms the models' text outputs. This suggests that hidden states
capture richer economic information than the responses of the LLMs reveal
directly. A learning curve analysis indicates that only a few dozen labelled
examples are sufficient for training. We also propose a transfer learning
method that improves estimation accuracy without requiring any labelled data
for the target variable. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of
hidden-state representations in super-resolution and data imputation tasks.

Conclusion: ASEE方法通过灵活的模态匹配和生成技术有效克服了现有局限性，为事件抽取任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Event extraction (EE) is a fundamental task in natural language processing
(NLP) that involves identifying and extracting event information from
unstructured text. Effective EE in real-world scenarios requires two key steps:
selecting appropriate schemas from hundreds of candidates and executing the
extraction process. Existing research exhibits two critical gaps: (1) the rigid
schema fixation in existing pipeline systems, and (2) the absence of benchmarks
for evaluating joint schema matching and extraction. Although large language
models (LLMs) offer potential solutions, their schema hallucination tendencies
and context window limitations pose challenges for practical deployment. In
response, we propose Adaptive Schema-aware Event Extraction (ASEE), a novel
paradigm combining schema paraphrasing with schema retrieval-augmented
generation. ASEE adeptly retrieves paraphrased schemas and accurately generates
targeted structures. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct the
Multi-Dimensional Schema-aware Event Extraction (MD-SEE) benchmark, which
systematically consolidates 12 datasets across diverse domains, complexity
levels, and language settings. Extensive evaluations on MD-SEE show that our
proposed ASEE demonstrates strong adaptability across various scenarios,
significantly improving the accuracy of event extraction.

Abstract: This work introduces the first benchmark for nursing value alignment,
consisting of five core value dimensions distilled from international nursing
codes: Altruism, Human Dignity, Integrity, Justice, and Professionalism. The
benchmark comprises 1,100 real-world nursing behavior instances collected
through a five-month longitudinal field study across three hospitals of varying
tiers. These instances are annotated by five clinical nurses and then augmented
with LLM-generated counterfactuals with reversed ethic polarity. Each original
case is paired with a value-aligned and a value-violating version, resulting in
2,200 labeled instances that constitute the Easy-Level dataset. To increase
adversarial complexity, each instance is further transformed into a
dialogue-based format that embeds contextual cues and subtle misleading
signals, yielding a Hard-Level dataset. We evaluate 23 state-of-the-art (SoTA)
LLMs on their alignment with nursing values. Our findings reveal three key
insights: (1) DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest performance on the Easy-Level
dataset (94.55), where Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms other models on the
Hard-Level dataset (89.43), significantly surpassing the medical LLMs; (2)
Justice is consistently the most difficult nursing value dimension to evaluate;
and (3) in-context learning significantly improves alignment. This work aims to
provide a foundation for value-sensitive LLMs development in clinical settings.

Motivation: 探究自回归大语言模型是否能从不同分词顺序的序列中学到一致的概率分布，验证理论不变性在实际训练中的表现，并分析偏差来源。

Method: 通过理论证明序列困惑度的不变性，对比训练GPT-2模型在不同分词顺序（正向、反向、随机排列）下的表现，分析自注意力机制中的偏差。

Result: 实验发现，不同分词顺序导致模型概率分布的系统性偏差，随机排列的偏差尤为显著；正向和反向模型表现相对接近，但仍存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在概率分布学习中的位置偏见问题，为理解模型不可靠性提供了新视角，并提出了检测不一致性的方法。

Abstract: Can autoregressive large language models (LLMs) learn consistent probability
distributions when trained on sequences in different token orders? We prove
formally that for any well-defined probability distribution, sequence
perplexity is invariant under any factorization, including forward, backward,
or arbitrary permutations. This result establishes a rigorous theoretical
foundation for studying how LLMs learn from data and defines principled
protocols for empirical evaluation. Applying these protocols, we show that
prior studies examining ordering effects suffer from critical methodological
flaws. We retrain GPT-2 models across forward, backward, and arbitrary permuted
orders on scientific text. We find systematic deviations from theoretical
invariance across all orderings with arbitrary permutations strongly deviating
from both forward and backward models, which largely (but not completely)
agreed with one another. Deviations were traceable to differences in
self-attention, reflecting positional and locality biases in processing. Our
theoretical and empirical results provide novel avenues for understanding
positional biases in LLMs and suggest methods for detecting when LLMs'
probability distributions are inconsistent and therefore untrustworthy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs方法缺乏AC理论基础，解释性不足。

Method: AC-Reason框架：识别因果事件，推断形式化因果因素值，理论引导算法回答AC查询。

Result: AC-Reason显著提升LLMs表现，GPT-4 + AC-Reason在BBH-CJ和AC-Bench上均最优（75.04%和71.82%）。

Conclusion: AC理论与LLMs结合高效，AC-Reason算法贡献最大性能提升。

Abstract: Actual causality (AC), a fundamental aspect of causal reasoning (CR), is
responsible for attribution and responsibility assignment in real-world
scenarios. However, existing LLM-based methods lack grounding in formal AC
theory, resulting in limited interpretability. Therefore, we propose AC-Reason,
a semi-formal reasoning framework that identifies causally relevant events
within an AC scenario, infers the values of their formal causal factors (e.g.,
sufficiency, necessity, and normality), and answers AC queries via a
theory-guided algorithm with explanations. While AC-Reason does not explicitly
construct a causal graph, it operates over variables in the underlying causal
structure to support principled reasoning. To enable comprehensive evaluation,
we introduce AC-Bench, a new benchmark built upon and substantially extending
Big-Bench Hard Causal Judgment (BBH-CJ). AC-Bench comprises ~1K carefully
annotated samples, each with detailed reasoning steps and focuses solely on
actual causation. The case study shows that synthesized samples in AC-Bench
present greater challenges for LLMs. Extensive experiments on BBH-CJ and
AC-Bench show that AC-Reason consistently improves LLM performance over
baselines. On BBH-CJ, all tested LLMs surpass the average human rater accuracy
of 69.60%, with GPT-4 + AC-Reason achieving 75.04%. On AC-Bench, GPT-4 +
AC-Reason again achieves the highest accuracy of 71.82%. AC-Bench further
enables fine-grained analysis of reasoning faithfulness, revealing that only
Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4o exhibit faithful
reasoning, whereas GPT-4 tends to exploit shortcuts. Finally, our ablation
study proves that integrating AC theory into LLMs is highly effective, with the
proposed algorithm contributing the most significant performance gains.

Method: 开发了合成标注框架以生成高质量多语言多模态数据，并提出跨模态模型合并技术以减少灾难性遗忘。

Result: Aya-Vision-8B和Aya-Vision-32B在性能上超越同类模型，甚至优于更大规模的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态多语言领域取得了显著进展，同时提供了高效计算的解决方案。

Abstract: Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires
aligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction
data, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once
vision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the
multilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages
exacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning,
and catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned
challenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling.
First, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality,
diverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to
produce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many
languages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only
capabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance.
Aya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal
models such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger
Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which
outperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and
LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the
multi-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively
bend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.

Abstract: We present HealthBench, an open-source benchmark measuring the performance

5,000 multi-turn conversations between a model and an individual user or
healthcare professional. Responses are evaluated using conversation-specific
rubrics created by 262 physicians. Unlike previous multiple-choice or
short-answer benchmarks, HealthBench enables realistic, open-ended evaluation
through 48,562 unique rubric criteria spanning several health contexts (e.g.,
emergencies, transforming clinical data, global health) and behavioral
dimensions (e.g., accuracy, instruction following, communication). HealthBench
performance over the last two years reflects steady initial progress (compare
GPT-3.5 Turbo's 16% to GPT-4o's 32%) and more rapid recent improvements (o3
scores 60%). Smaller models have especially improved: GPT-4.1 nano outperforms
GPT-4o and is 25 times cheaper. We additionally release two HealthBench
variations: HealthBench Consensus, which includes 34 particularly important
dimensions of model behavior validated via physician consensus, and HealthBench
Hard, where the current top score is 32%. We hope that HealthBench grounds
progress towards model development and applications that benefit human health.

TL;DR: Blockbuster是一个用于AI算子融合的框架，适用于具有分层内存的多处理器架构，并通过显式建模数据块在内存层间的移动，提供强大的融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI算子融合算法通常忽略数据在内存层间的移动，导致性能未达最优。Blockbuster通过直接建模数据移动，旨在提升融合效果。

Method: Blockbuster提出了一种基于规则的融合算法，由候选选择算法和融合算法组成，特别关注数据块在内存层间的移动。

Result: 该算法不仅能自动重建已知的Flash Attention内核，还能实现复杂算子融合（如LayerNorm与矩阵乘的融合），生成高效的单一巨型内核。

Conclusion: Blockbuster通过显式建模数据移动，显著提升了AI算子融合的能力，适用于大规模AI程序。

Abstract: Blockbuster is a framework for AI operator fusion in inference programs. The
Blockbuster framework is compatible with any multiprocessor architecture that
has a tiered memory hierarchy, including GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and some AI
accelerator chips. It includes a graph-based representation for AI workloads,
called a block program, which explicitly models how blocks of data move between
the memory tiers. It also includes an operator fusion procedure, which is made
up of a candidate selection algorithm and a fusion algorithm that fuses each
individual candidate - this two-algorithm structure makes Blockbuster
especially suitable for large AI programs. The current paper focuses on the
fusion algorithm, which is a rule-based technique. While the literature is full
of previous rule-based fusion algorithms, what sets our algorithm apart is its
direct modeling of data movement between memory tiers, resulting in uniquely
powerful fusion results. As a first sanity check, we demonstrate how our
algorithm automatically rediscovers the well-known Flash Attention kernel.
Then, we demonstrate the real power of our approach by fusing LayerNorm with
matrix multiplication and RMSNorm with FNN-SwiGLU - the latter involves fusing
three matrix multiplications, a Hadamard product, a reduction, and a few
elementwise operations into a single mega-kernel.

Result: 在五个OPF基准测试中，自动设计方法始终优于人工设计，并揭示了重要环境设计决策的见解。

Conclusion: 该方法是首个通用的自动RL环境设计方法，但也需注意避免对RL算法的过拟合风险。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are increasingly used to solve the
optimal power flow (OPF) problem. Yet, the question of how to design RL
environments to maximize training performance remains unanswered, both for the
OPF and the general case. We propose a general approach for automated RL
environment design by utilizing multi-objective optimization. For that, we use
the hyperparameter optimization (HPO) framework, which allows the reuse of
existing HPO algorithms and methods. On five OPF benchmark problems, we
demonstrate that our automated design approach consistently outperforms a
manually created baseline environment design. Further, we use statistical
analyses to determine which environment design decisions are especially
important for performance, resulting in multiple novel insights on how RL-OPF
environments should be designed. Finally, we discuss the risk of overfitting
the environment to the utilized RL algorithm. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first general approach for automated RL environment design.

product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is
crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective
representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods
often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique
characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking
the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper,
we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous
Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node
representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during
the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous
graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is
integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal
fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the
propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities.
Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing
modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the
node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal
data, especially when accompanied with network structures.

Abstract: The dyadic reaction generation task involves synthesizing responsive facial
reactions that align closely with the behaviors of a conversational partner,
enhancing the naturalness and effectiveness of human-like interaction
simulations. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Latent Behavior
Diffusion Model, comprising a context-aware autoencoder and a diffusion-based
conditional generator that addresses the challenge of generating diverse and
contextually relevant facial reactions from input speaker behaviors. The
autoencoder compresses high-dimensional input features, capturing dynamic
patterns in listener reactions while condensing complex input data into a
concise latent representation, facilitating more expressive and contextually
appropriate reaction synthesis. The diffusion-based conditional generator
operates on the latent space generated by the autoencoder to predict realistic
facial reactions in a non-autoregressive manner. This approach allows for
generating diverse facial reactions that reflect subtle variations in
conversational cues and emotional states. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving superior performance in dyadic
reaction synthesis tasks compared to existing methods.

*Karahan Sarıtaş,Çağatay Yıldız*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究重新验证了自注意力机制实现核主成分分析（KPCA）的声称，发现其与KPCA视角提出的内容存在三项不一致，并得出结论称自注意力的KPCA解释缺乏实证支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是验证近期关于自注意力机制实现KPCA的声称，特别是关于值向量V捕捉密钥矩阵的格拉姆矩阵特征向量，以及自注意力将查询投射到密钥矩阵主成分轴上的假设。

Method: 研究通过分析多种相似性度量（如最优余弦相似度和中心核对齐），比较了学习的自注意力值向量与KPCA视角提出的内容之间的对应关系，并检验了解构损失的下降是否合理。

Result: 研究结果显示，自注意力值向量与KPCA视角提出的内容之间没有显著对应关系，解构损失的下降被误解，并且格拉姆矩阵特征值统计不可复现。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，自注意力的KPCA解释缺乏实证支持，特别是在10种变压器架构中均未发现支持该解释的证据。

Abstract: In this reproduction study, we revisit recent claims that self-attention
implements kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) (Teo et al., 2024),
positing that (i) value vectors $V$ capture the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix
of the keys, and (ii) that self-attention projects queries onto the principal
component axes of the key matrix $K$ in a feature space. Our analysis reveals
three critical inconsistencies: (1) No alignment exists between learned
self-attention value vectors and what is proposed in the KPCA perspective, with
average similarity metrics (optimal cosine similarity $\leq 0.32$, linear CKA
(Centered Kernel Alignment) $\leq 0.11$, kernel CKA $\leq 0.32$) indicating
negligible correspondence; (2) Reported decreases in reconstruction loss
$J_\text{proj}$, arguably justifying the claim that the self-attention
minimizes the projection error of KPCA, are misinterpreted, as the quantities
involved differ by orders of magnitude ($\sim\!10^3$); (3) Gram matrix
eigenvalue statistics, introduced to justify that $V$ captures the eigenvector
of the gram matrix, are irreproducible without undocumented
implementation-specific adjustments. Across 10 transformer architectures, we
conclude that the KPCA interpretation of self-attention lacks empirical
support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的‘XAI一致性’概念，通过多目标优化框架在超参数调优中平衡预测性能与解释鲁棒性，并定义了相关定量指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超参数调优或神经架构优化中，可解释性（XAI）常被忽视，研究旨在通过量化不同特征归因方法的一致性，将其直接纳入优化目标。

Method: 在SPOT工具箱中实现多目标优化框架，结合加权聚合和基于期望的策略，探索将XAI一致性纳入优化过程的影响。

Result: 研究揭示了架构配置空间中的三个区域：性能差且可解释性低、预测强但可解释性弱（因XAI一致性低），以及平衡性能与可解释性的折中区域。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来研究奠定了基础，探讨折中区域的模型是否因避免过拟合而更具鲁棒性，从而在分布外数据上表现更可靠。

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
explainability is rarely considered during hyperparameter tuning or neural
architecture optimization, where the focus remains primarily on minimizing
predictive loss. In this work, we introduce the novel concept of XAI
consistency, defined as the agreement among different feature attribution
methods, and propose new metrics to quantify it. For the first time, we
integrate XAI consistency directly into the hyperparameter tuning objective,
creating a multi-objective optimization framework that balances predictive
performance with explanation robustness. Implemented within the Sequential
Parameter Optimization Toolbox (SPOT), our approach uses both weighted
aggregation and desirability-based strategies to guide model selection. Through
our proposed framework and supporting tools, we explore the impact of
incorporating XAI consistency into the optimization process. This enables us to
characterize distinct regions in the architecture configuration space: one
region with poor performance and comparatively low interpretability, another
with strong predictive performance but weak interpretability due to low
\gls{xai} consistency, and a trade-off region that balances both objectives by
offering high interpretability alongside competitive performance. Beyond
introducing this novel approach, our research provides a foundation for future
investigations into whether models from the trade-off zone-balancing
performance loss and XAI consistency-exhibit greater robustness by avoiding
overfitting to training performance, thereby leading to more reliable
predictions on out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Bayesian inference has many advantages in decision making of agents (e.g.
robotics/simulative agent) over a regular data-driven black-box neural network:
Data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety where these
advantages benefit directly/indirectly from the uncertainty quantification of
Bayesian inference. However, there are few comprehensive reviews to summarize
the progress of Bayesian inference on reinforcement learning (RL) for decision
making to give researchers a systematic understanding. This paper focuses on
combining Bayesian inference with RL that nowadays is an important approach in
agent decision making. To be exact, this paper discusses the following five
topics: 1) Bayesian methods that have potential for agent decision making.
First basic Bayesian methods and models (Bayesian rule, Bayesian learning, and
Bayesian conjugate models) are discussed followed by variational inference,
Bayesian optimization, Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian active learning,
Bayesian generative models, Bayesian meta-learning, and lifelong Bayesian
learning. 2) Classical combinations of Bayesian methods with model-based RL
(with approximation methods), model-free RL, and inverse RL. 3) Latest
combinations of potential Bayesian methods with RL. 4) Analytical comparisons
of methods that combine Bayesian methods with RL with respect to
data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety. 5) In-depth
discussions in six complex problem variants of RL, including unknown reward,
partial-observability, multi-agent, multi-task, non-linear non-Gaussian, and
hierarchical RL problems and the summary of how Bayesian methods work in the
data collection, data processing and policy learning stages of RL to pave the
way for better agent decision-making strategies.

TL;DR: 该研究针对资源受限的微控制器部署深度学习模型进行裂缝分割的难题，提出了轻量化的U-Net架构，通过减少卷积核数量、网络深度和使用深度可分离卷积，在性能和资源消耗之间取得平衡，适用于低功耗的TinyML应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 裂缝分割在结构健康监测（SHM）中至关重要，但资源受限的微控制器限制了深度学习模型的应用，研究旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用三种优化策略：减少卷积核数量、降低网络深度、使用深度可分离卷积（DWConv2D），设计轻量化的U-Net架构。

Result: 优化后的模型显著降低了RAM、Flash需求和推理时间，尽管在准确性上有所妥协，但仍实现了较好的分割性能和资源消耗平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推动了基于TinyML的裂缝分割技术，还为能源自主的边缘SHM系统提供了可能性。

Abstract: Crack segmentation can play a critical role in Structural Health Monitoring
(SHM) by enabling accurate identification of crack size and location, which
allows to monitor structural damages over time. However, deploying deep
learning models for crack segmentation on resource-constrained microcontrollers
presents significant challenges due to limited memory, computational power, and
energy resources. To address these challenges, this study explores lightweight
U-Net architectures tailored for TinyML applications, focusing on three
optimization strategies: filter number reduction, network depth reduction, and
the use of Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DWConv2D). Our results demonstrate
that reducing convolution kernels and network depth significantly reduces RAM
and Flash requirement, and inference times, albeit with some accuracy
trade-offs. Specifically, by reducing the filer number to 25%, the network
depth to four blocks, and utilizing depthwise convolutions, a good compromise
between segmentation performance and resource consumption is achieved. This
makes the network particularly suitable for low-power TinyML applications. This
study not only advances TinyML-based crack segmentation but also provides the
possibility for energy-autonomous edge SHM systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络（SNN）的小样本学习框架FSL-SNN，通过自特征提取和跨特征对比模块优化特征表示并降低功耗，提高了SNN在Few-shot学习任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNN）在小样本学习（FSL）任务中表现出色，但计算成本高且可扩展性差。脉冲神经网络（SNN）因其事件驱动特性和低能耗更高效，但在捕获复杂时空特征和跨类比较方面仍有局限。

Method: 提出了一个结合自特征提取模块和跨特征对比模块的SNN框架，并采用时间高效训练损失和InfoNCE损失优化脉冲序列的动态特性和区分能力。

Result: 在神经形态数据集N-Omniglot上分类性能显著提升，在静态数据集CUB和miniImageNet上也达到与人工神经网络（ANN）相当的性能，且功耗较低。

Conclusion: FSL-SNN有效地提高了SNN在小样本学习中的性能，同时在能效方面表现出色，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel in computer vision tasks, especially,
few-shot learning (FSL), which is increasingly important for generalizing from
limited examples. However, DNNs are computationally expensive with scalability
issues in real world. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven
nature and low energy consumption, are particularly efficient in processing
sparse and dynamic data, though they still encounter difficulties in capturing
complex spatiotemporal features and performing accurate cross-class
comparisons. To further enhance the performance and efficiency of SNNs in
few-shot learning, we propose a few-shot learning framework based on SNNs,
which combines a self-feature extractor module and a cross-feature contrastive
module to refine feature representation and reduce power consumption. We apply
the combination of temporal efficient training loss and InfoNCE loss to
optimize the temporal dynamics of spike trains and enhance the discriminative
power. Experimental results show that the proposed FSL-SNN significantly
improves the classification performance on the neuromorphic dataset N-Omniglot,
and also achieves competitive performance to ANNs on static datasets such as
CUB and miniImageNet with low power consumption.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号回归方法需要预定义函数集，限制了灵活性。本文旨在通过LLM和图像输入实现更灵活且无需预定义条件的回归。

Method: 1. 用LLM从函数图像生成假设（ansatz）；2. 数值优化拟合参数；3. 遗传算法进化假设种群；4. 结合KAN扩展到多元函数，并通过LLM简化表达式。

Result: 展示了单变量函数回归的通用性（“univariate is all you need”），并通过KAN成功扩展至多元函数，简化后表达式更高效。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无需预定义函数集的符号回归，结合KAN和LLM的灵活性，为复杂函数建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to symbolic regression using vision-capable large
language models (LLMs) and the ideas behind Google DeepMind's Funsearch. The
LLM is given a plot of a univariate function and tasked with proposing an
ansatz for that function. The free parameters of the ansatz are fitted using
standard numerical optimisers, and a collection of such ans\"atze make up the
population of a genetic algorithm. Unlike other symbolic regression techniques,
our method does not require the specification of a set of functions to be used
in regression, but with appropriate prompt engineering, we can arbitrarily
condition the generative step. By using Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), we
demonstrate that ``univariate is all you need'' for symbolic regression, and
extend this method to multivariate functions by learning the univariate
function on each edge of a trained KAN. The combined expression is then
simplified by further processing with a language model.

Abstract: Recent research enhances language model reasoning by scaling test-time
compute via longer chain-of-thought traces. This often improves accuracy but
also introduces redundancy and high computational cost, especially for small
language models distilled with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we
propose new algorithms to improve token-efficient reasoning with small-scale
models by effectively trading off accuracy and computation. We first show that
the post-SFT model fails to determine the optimal stopping point of the
reasoning process, resulting in verbose and repetitive outputs. Verbosity also
significantly varies across wrong vs correct responses. To address these
issues, we propose two solutions: (1) Temperature scaling (TS) to control the
stopping point for the thinking phase and thereby trace length, and (2) TLDR: a
length-regularized reinforcement learning method based on GRPO that facilitates
multi-level trace length control (e.g. short, medium, long reasoning).
Experiments on four reasoning benchmarks, MATH500, AMC, AIME24 and
OlympiadBench, demonstrate that TS is highly effective compared to s1's budget
forcing approach and TLDR significantly improves token efficiency by about 50%
with minimal to no accuracy loss over the SFT baseline. Moreover, TLDR also
facilitates flexible control over the response length, offering a practical and
effective solution for token-efficient reasoning in small models. Ultimately,
our work reveals the importance of stopping time control, highlights
shortcomings of pure SFT, and provides effective algorithmic recipes.

Motivation: 机器学习模型依赖的训练数据常包含敏感信息，引发隐私问题。匿名化技术虽能保护隐私，但其对ML公平性的具体影响尚未充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统审计匿名化技术对个体和群体公平性的影响，采用量化方法分析不同隐私设置和数据分布下的效果。

Result: 匿名化技术可能导致群体公平性指标下降高达四个数量级，而相似性个体公平性指标在更强的匿名化下有所提升。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了隐私、公平性和效用之间的权衡关系，为负责任的AI开发提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms are heavily based on the availability of
training data, which, depending on the domain, often includes sensitive
information about data providers. This raises critical privacy concerns.
Anonymization techniques have emerged as a practical solution to address these
issues by generalizing features or suppressing data to make it more difficult
to accurately identify individuals. Although recent studies have shown that
privacy-enhancing technologies can influence ML predictions across different
subgroups, thus affecting fair decision-making, the specific effects of
anonymization techniques, such as $k$-anonymity, $\ell$-diversity, and
$t$-closeness, on ML fairness remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
systematically audit the impact of anonymization techniques on ML fairness,
evaluating both individual and group fairness. Our quantitative study reveals
that anonymization can degrade group fairness metrics by up to four orders of
magnitude. Conversely, similarity-based individual fairness metrics tend to
improve under stronger anonymization, largely as a result of increased input
homogeneity. By analyzing varying levels of anonymization across diverse
privacy settings and data distributions, this study provides critical insights
into the trade-offs between privacy, fairness, and utility, offering actionable
guidelines for responsible AI development. Our code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: FairZK为机器学习公平性验证提供了一种高效且保密的新方法，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: With the rise of machine learning techniques, ensuring the fairness of
decisions made by machine learning algorithms has become of great importance in
critical applications. However, measuring fairness often requires full access
to the model parameters, which compromises the confidentiality of the models.
In this paper, we propose a solution using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows
the model owner to convince the public that a machine learning model is fair
while preserving the secrecy of the model. To circumvent the efficiency barrier
of naively proving machine learning inferences in zero-knowledge, our key
innovation is a new approach to measure fairness only with model parameters and
some aggregated information of the input, but not on any specific dataset. To
achieve this goal, we derive new bounds for the fairness of logistic regression
and deep neural network models that are tighter and better reflecting the
fairness compared to prior work. Moreover, we develop efficient zero-knowledge
proof protocols for common computations involved in measuring fairness,
including the spectral norm of matrices, maximum, absolute value, and
fixed-point arithmetic.
  We have fully implemented our system, FairZK, that proves machine learning
fairness in zero-knowledge. Experimental results show that FairZK is
significantly faster than the naive approach and an existing scheme that use
zero-knowledge inferences as a subroutine. The prover time is improved by
3.1x--1789x depending on the size of the model and the dataset. FairZK can
scale to a large model with 47 million parameters for the first time, and
generates a proof for its fairness in 343 seconds. This is estimated to be 4
orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, which only scale to small
models with hundreds to thousands of parameters.

Conclusion: 所提方法在高效压缩与对抗鲁棒性间取得平衡，具有普适性与计算效率。

Abstract: Deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained devices demands models
that are both compact and robust to adversarial inputs. However, compression
and adversarial robustness often conflict. In this work, we introduce a
dynamical low-rank training scheme enhanced with a novel spectral regularizer
that controls the condition number of the low-rank core in each layer. This
approach mitigates the sensitivity of compressed models to adversarial
perturbations without sacrificing clean accuracy. The method is model- and
data-agnostic, computationally efficient, and supports rank adaptivity to
automatically compress the network at hand. Extensive experiments across
standard architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks show the regularized
networks can achieve over 94% compression while recovering or improving
adversarial accuracy relative to uncompressed baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing

reliance on a central server, mitigating the single point of failure inherent
in the traditional FL paradigm, while introducing deployment challenges on
resource-constrained devices. To evaluate real-world applicability, this work
designs and deploys a physical testbed using edge devices such as Raspberry Pi
and Jetson Nano. The testbed is built upon a DFL training platform, NEBULA, and
extends it with a power monitoring module to measure energy consumption during
training. Experiments across multiple datasets show that model performance is
influenced by the communication topology, with denser topologies leading to
better outcomes in DFL settings.

Motivation: 传统稀疏自动编码器（SAEs）分析方法仅依赖输入侧激活而忽略了潜在特征对模型输出的因果影响。论文假设激活的潜在特征对输出的贡献不均且只有高因果影响力的潜在特征对模型操控有效，这促使研究如何更准确地识别这些关键特征。

Method: 提出GradSAE方法，利用输出侧梯度信息来量化每个潜在特征的因果影响力，从而筛选出对模型输出最具影响力的特征。

Result: GradSAE证明了通过梯度信息识别高因果影响力特征的可行性，改进了模型解译和操控的效果。

Conclusion: 研究表明结合输出梯度信息的GradSAE优于传统方法，为大型语言模型的内部表达解译和操控提供了新工具。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
interpreting and steering the internal representations of large language models
(LLMs). However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely
solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence
between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two
key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the
construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal
influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we
propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method
that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side
gradient information.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced
significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of
synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world
due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic
data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models.
Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations
between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality
differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a
novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two
datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality
of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing
the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机森林的联邦学习框架，解决隐私和数据分散问题，在保持高预测准确性的同时满足严格隐私要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗等领域因隐私和法规限制无法集中数据，现有联邦学习框架主要支持梯度模型，缺乏可解释性强的树模型方法。

Method: 利用PySyft进行隐私保护计算，支持加权模型平均、增量学习和本地评估，实现分散数据上的随机森林训练。

Result: 在现实医疗数据集实验中，预测准确性与集中式方法相差不超过9%，满足隐私要求。

Conclusion: 填补了联邦学习中树模型的空白，为需要透明性和可靠性的分布式机器学习任务提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Privacy and regulatory barriers often hinder centralized machine learning
solutions, particularly in sectors like healthcare where data cannot be freely
shared. Federated learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm to address these
concerns; however, existing frameworks primarily support gradient-based models,
leaving a gap for more interpretable, tree-based approaches. This paper
introduces a federated learning framework for Random Forest classifiers that
preserves data privacy and provides robust performance in distributed settings.
By leveraging PySyft for secure, privacy-aware computation, our method enables
multiple institutions to collaboratively train Random Forest models on locally
stored data without exposing sensitive information. The framework supports
weighted model averaging to account for varying data distributions, incremental
learning to progressively refine models, and local evaluation to assess
performance across heterogeneous datasets. Experiments on two real-world
healthcare benchmarks demonstrate that the federated approach maintains
competitive predictive accuracy - within a maximum 9\% margin of centralized
methods - while satisfying stringent privacy requirements. These findings
underscore the viability of tree-based federated learning for scenarios where
data cannot be centralized due to regulatory, competitive, or technical
constraints. The proposed solution addresses a notable gap in existing
federated learning libraries, offering an adaptable tool for secure distributed
machine learning tasks that demand both transparency and reliable performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据通常位于低维非线性流形附近（流形假设），通过学习黎曼几何可以提升聚类、降维和插值等任务的性能和可解释性。但多模态数据中的失真和建模误差仍需解决。

Abstract: Modern machine learning increasingly leverages the insight that
high-dimensional data often lie near low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds, an
idea known as the manifold hypothesis. By explicitly modeling the geometric
structure of data through learning Riemannian geometry algorithms can achieve
improved performance and interpretability in tasks like clustering,
dimensionality reduction, and interpolation. In particular, learned pullback
geometry has recently undergone transformative developments that now make it
scalable to learn and scalable to evaluate, which further opens the door for
principled non-linear data analysis and interpretable machine learning.
However, there are still steps to be taken when considering real-world
multi-modal data. This work focuses on addressing distortions and modeling
errors that can arise in the multi-modal setting and proposes to alleviate both
challenges through isometrizing the learned Riemannian structure and balancing
regularity and expressivity of the diffeomorphism parametrization. We showcase
the effectiveness of the synergy of the proposed approaches in several
numerical experiments with both synthetic and real data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的高阶正则化（HR）方法，用于机器学习和强化学习中的神经网络训练，该方法不仅保证了算法的可收敛性，还揭示了正则化与可解释学习之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在强化学习中使用神经网络逼近动作价值函数，需要正则化方法不仅确保收敛性，还能提供解释性。作者试图通过高阶正则化建立正则化与可解释学习之间的理论联系。

Method: 论文提出了高阶正则化（HR）方法，将其视为一种逆映射逼近，并证明$L_2$正则化是其特例。HR提供了误差的上下界，并通过正则化矩阵最大化神经网络的泛化能力。

Result: 论文验证了HR方法在经典控制问题中的性能，结果表明HR显著提高了神经网络的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HR不仅改进了正则化的效果，还为其提供了理论解释，使其适用于各类神经网络，从而推动了可解释学习的发展。

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel regularization procedure for machine learning. The
proposed high-order regularization (HR) provides new insight into
regularization, which is widely used to train a neural network that can be
utilized to approximate the action-value function in general reinforcement
learning problems. The proposed HR method ensures the provable convergence of
the approximation algorithm, which makes the much-needed connection between
regularization and explainable learning using neural networks. The proposed HR
method theoretically demonstrates that regularization can be regarded as an
approximation in terms of inverse mapping with explicitly calculable
approximation error, and the $L_2$ regularization is a lower-order case of the
proposed method. We provide lower and upper bounds for the error of the
proposed HR solution, which helps build a reliable model. We also find that
regularization with the proposed HR can be regarded as a contraction. We prove
that the generalizability of neural networks can be maximized with a proper
regularization matrix, and the proposed HR is applicable for neural networks
with any mapping matrix. With the theoretical explanation of the extreme
learning machine for neural network training and the proposed high-order
regularization, one can better interpret the output of the neural network, thus
leading to explainable learning. We present a case study based on regularized
extreme learning neural networks to demonstrate the application of the proposed
HR and give the corresponding incremental HR solution. We verify the
performance of the proposed HR method by solving a classic control problem in
reinforcement learning. The result demonstrates the superior performance of the
method with significant enhancement in the generalizability of the neural
network.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancements in recent years,
with models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, showcasing their remarkable capabilities
across diverse domains. While substantial research has been conducted on LLMs

Conclusion: 论文强调了现有遗忘方法的局限性，提出了计算遗忘的新方向，并指出了未来研究需要解决的关键问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning methods take a model trained on a dataset and a forget
set, then attempt to produce a model as if it had only been trained on the
examples not in the forget set. We empirically show that an adversary is able
to distinguish between a mirror model (a control model produced by retraining
without the data to forget) and a model produced by an unlearning method across
representative unlearning methods from the literature. We build distinguishing
algorithms based on evaluation scores in the literature (i.e. membership
inference scores) and Kullback-Leibler divergence.
  We propose a strong formal definition for machine unlearning called
computational unlearning. Computational unlearning is defined as the inability
for an adversary to distinguish between a mirror model and a model produced by
an unlearning method. If the adversary cannot guess better than random (except
with negligible probability), then we say that an unlearning method achieves
computational unlearning.
  Our computational unlearning definition provides theoretical structure to
prove unlearning feasibility results. For example, our computational unlearning
definition immediately implies that there are no deterministic computational
unlearning methods for entropic learning algorithms. We also explore the
relationship between differential privacy (DP)-based unlearning methods and
computational unlearning, showing that DP-based approaches can satisfy
computational unlearning at the cost of an extreme utility collapse. These
results demonstrate that current methodology in the literature fundamentally
falls short of achieving computational unlearning. We conclude by identifying
several open questions for future work.

Conclusion: QMLHFL通过多层架构和量化方案解决了分层联邦学习的扩展性问题，并提供了理论支持与优化方法，适用于复杂网络场景。

Abstract: Almost all existing hierarchical federated learning (FL) models are limited
to two aggregation layers, restricting scalability and flexibility in complex,
large-scale networks. In this work, we propose a Multi-Layer Hierarchical
Federated Learning framework (QMLHFL), which appears to be the first study that
generalizes hierarchical FL to arbitrary numbers of layers and network
architectures through nested aggregation, while employing a layer-specific
quantization scheme to meet communication constraints. We develop a
comprehensive convergence analysis for QMLHFL and derive a general convergence
condition and rate that reveal the effects of key factors, including
quantization parameters, hierarchical architecture, and intra-layer iteration
counts. Furthermore, we determine the optimal number of intra-layer iterations
to maximize the convergence rate while meeting a deadline constraint that
accounts for both communication and computation times. Our results show that
QMLHFL consistently achieves high learning accuracy, even under high data
heterogeneity, and delivers notably improved performance when optimized,
compared to using randomly selected values.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is critical for many applications, where deep
learning-based point prediction models have demonstrated strong performance.
However, in practical scenarios, there is also a need to quantify predictive
uncertainty through online confidence intervals. Existing confidence interval
modeling approaches building upon these deep point prediction models suffer
from key limitations: they either require costly retraining, fail to fully
leverage the representational strengths of deep models, or lack theoretical
guarantees. To address these gaps, we propose a lightweight conformal
prediction method that provides valid coverage and shorter interval lengths
without retraining. Our approach leverages features extracted from pre-trained
point prediction models to fit a residual predictor and construct confidence
intervals, further enhanced by an adaptive coverage control mechanism.
Theoretically, we prove that our method achieves asymptotic coverage
convergence, with error bounds dependent on the feature quality of the
underlying point prediction model. Experiments on 12 datasets demonstrate that
our method delivers tighter confidence intervals while maintaining desired
coverage rates. Code, model and dataset in

Motivation: 现有方法在离线安全强化学习中主要关注短期安全性，忽视了长期安全性，且在处理分布外数据时表现不佳。FASP旨在解决这些问题，提供长期安全保证并提升样本效率。

Method: 使用Hamilton-Jacobi可达性分析生成安全标签，训练条件变分自编码器（CVAE）和安全分类器。结合悲观估计方法优化奖励和成本的Q值估计，减少分布外动作的误差。

Result: 在DSRL基准测试中，FASP算法在多个任务中表现优异，尤其在安全性方面优于现有最优算法。

Conclusion: FASP通过结合可达性分析和悲观估计，有效解决了离线安全强化学习中的长期安全性和分布外动作问题，验证了方法的理论和实践有效性。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning(OSRL) derives constraint-satisfying
policies from pre-collected datasets, offers a promising avenue for deploying
RL in safety-critical real-world domains such as robotics. However, the
majority of existing approaches emphasize only short-term safety, neglecting
long-horizon considerations. Consequently, they may violate safety constraints
and fail to ensure sustained protection during online deployment. Moreover, the
learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not
present or out-of-distribution(OOD) from the offline dataset, and exhibit
limited sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework Feasibility-Aware offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with CVAE-based
Pessimism (FASP). First, we employ Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) reachability analysis
to generate reliable safety labels, which serve as supervisory signals for
training both a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and a safety
classifier. This approach not only ensures high sampling efficiency but also
provides rigorous long-horizon safety guarantees. Furthermore, we utilize
pessimistic estimation methods to estimate the Q-value of reward and cost,
which mitigates the extrapolation errors induces by OOD actions, and penalize
unsafe actions to enabled the agent to proactively avoid high-risk behaviors.
Moreover, we theoretically prove the validity of this pessimistic estimation.
Extensive experiments on DSRL benchmarks demonstrate that FASP algorithm
achieves competitive performance across multiple experimental tasks,
particularly outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of safety.

Conclusion: DSADF通过协调直觉与深度推理，为复杂环境中的自适应决策提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are effective in well-defined
environments, they often struggle to generalize their learned policies to
dynamic settings due to their reliance on trial-and-error interactions. Recent
work has explored applying Large Language Models (LLMs) or Vision Language
Models (VLMs) to boost the generalization of RL agents through policy
optimization guidance or prior knowledge. However, these approaches often lack
seamless coordination between the RL agent and the foundation model, leading to
unreasonable decision-making in unfamiliar environments and efficiency
bottlenecks. Making full use of the inferential capabilities of foundation
models and the rapid response capabilities of RL agents and enhancing the
interaction between the two to form a dual system is still a lingering
scientific question. To address this problem, we draw inspiration from
Kahneman's theory of fast thinking (System 1) and slow thinking (System 2),
demonstrating that balancing intuition and deep reasoning can achieve nimble
decision-making in a complex world. In this study, we propose a Dual-System
Adaptive Decision Framework (DSADF), integrating two complementary modules:
System 1, comprising an RL agent and a memory space for fast and intuitive
decision making, and System 2, driven by a VLM for deep and analytical
reasoning. DSADF facilitates efficient and adaptive decision-making by
combining the strengths of both systems. The empirical study in the video game
environment: Crafter and Housekeep demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposed method, showing significant improvements in decision abilities for
both unseen and known tasks.

Conclusion: MDMixer不仅改善了预测性能，还通过其设计平衡了效率和可解释性，为长期时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical
settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting
long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns
and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key
issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information,
the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and
seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting
framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using
clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale
forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically
assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to
individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal
patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal
elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks
demonstrate that MDMixer improves average MAE performance by 4.64% compared to
the recent state-of-the-art MLP-based method (TimeMixer), while achieving an
effective balance between training efficiency and model interpretability.

Motivation: 在PU学习中，训练数据仅包含正样本，而无标签样本可能包含正负样本。传统方法难以有效区分无标签样本中的负样本，因此需要一种新方法利用样本间的相似性来提升分类效果。

Method: 提出2-HNC方法，基于HNC的嵌套分区生成无标签样本的负样本可能性排序。第一阶段仅利用正样本约束生成初步分类，第二阶段加入高可能性负样本重新分类，最终通过正类比例先验选择最优分区。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验显示，2-HNC表现优于现有先进算法，尤其在负样本识别和分类准确性上表现突出。

Conclusion: 2-HNC通过结合网络流和PU学习的特性，提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，为PU学习领域提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: In many scenarios of binary classification, only positive instances are
provided in the training data, leaving the rest of the data unlabeled. This
setup, known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, is addressed here with a
network flow-based method which utilizes pairwise similarities between samples.
The method we propose here, 2-HNC, leverages Hochbaum's Normalized Cut (HNC)
and the set of solutions it provides by solving a parametric minimum cut
problem. The set of solutions, that are nested partitions of the samples into
two sets, correspond to varying tradeoff values between the two goals: high
intra-similarity inside the sets and low inter-similarity between the two sets.
This nested sequence is utilized here to deliver a ranking of unlabeled samples
by their likelihood of being negative. Building on this insight, our method,
2-HNC, proceeds in two stages. The first stage generates this ranking without
assuming any negative labels, using a problem formulation that is constrained
only on positive labeled samples. The second stage augments the positive set
with likely-negative samples and recomputes the classification. The final label
prediction selects among all generated partitions in both stages, the one that
delivers a positive class proportion, closest to a prior estimate of this
quantity, which is assumed to be given. Extensive experiments across synthetic
and real datasets show that 2-HNC yields strong performance and often surpasses
existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: To improve the identification of potential anomaly patterns in complex user
behavior, this paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on a deep
mixture density network. The method constructs a Gaussian mixture model
parameterized by a neural network, enabling conditional probability modeling of
user behavior. It effectively captures the multimodal distribution
characteristics commonly present in behavioral data. Unlike traditional
classifiers that rely on fixed thresholds or a single decision boundary, this
approach defines an anomaly scoring function based on probability density using
negative log-likelihood. This significantly enhances the model's ability to
detect rare and unstructured behaviors. Experiments are conducted on the
real-world network user dataset UNSW-NB15. A series of performance comparisons
and stability validation experiments are designed. These cover multiple
evaluation aspects, including Accuracy, F1- score, AUC, and loss fluctuation.
The results show that the proposed method outperforms several advanced neural
network architectures in both performance and training stability. This study
provides a more expressive and discriminative solution for user behavior
modeling and anomaly detection. It strongly promotes the application of deep
probabilistic modeling techniques in the fields of network security and
intelligent risk control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应低秩矩阵近似（LoRMA）方法，通过分块聚类和局部SVD提升压缩效果，在医学影像中显著优于全局SVD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全局SVD压缩忽视局部差异，导致细节丢失。医学影像局部变化显著，需针对性优化压缩方法。

Method: 将数据矩阵分块、聚类（k-means），对每组块局部SVD，分析块大小与压缩效率的关系。

Result: 自适应LoRMA在PSNR、SSIM、IoU等指标上优于全局SVD，保留边缘和病理区域细节，减少块效应。

Conclusion: 尽管计算成本更高，自适应LoRMA通过优先关键区域压缩，在诊断保真度和存储效率间取得平衡。

Abstract: Low-rank matrix approximation (LoRMA) is a fundamental tool for compressing
high-resolution data matrices by extracting important features while
suppressing redundancy. Low-rank methods, such as global singular value
decomposition (SVD), apply uniform compression across the entire data matrix,
often ignoring important local variations and leading to the loss of fine
structural details. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive
LoRMA, which partitions data matrix into overlapping patches, groups
structurally similar patches into several clusters using k-means, and performs
SVD within each cluster. We derive the overall compression factor accounting
for patch overlap and analyze how patch size influences compression efficiency
and computational cost. While the proposed adaptive LoRMA method is applicable
to any data exhibiting high local variation, we focus on medical imaging due to
its pronounced local variability. We evaluate and compare our adaptive LoRMA
against global SVD across four imaging modalities: MRI, ultrasound, CT scan,
and chest X-ray. Results demonstrate that adaptive LoRMA effectively preserves
structural integrity, edge details, and diagnostic relevance, as measured by
peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), mean
squared error (MSE), intersection over union (IoU), and edge preservation index
(EPI). Adaptive LoRMA significantly minimizes block artifacts and residual
errors, particularly in pathological regions, consistently outperforming global
SVD in terms of PSNR, SSIM, IoU, EPI, and achieving lower MSE. Adaptive LoRMA
prioritizes clinically salient regions while allowing aggressive compression in
non-critical regions, optimizing storage efficiency. Although adaptive LoRMA
requires higher processing time, its diagnostic fidelity justifies the overhead
for high-compression applications.

Method: 使用平方损失代理和ℓ_p惩罚的经验风险最小化方法，结合Tsybakov低噪声条件和硬边界假设。

Result: 在回归函数η足够平滑的情况下，DNN可以实现ℴ(n^(-α))的超额风险界限，其中α可以任意大。

Conclusion: 在硬边界条件下，深度神经网络能够有效处理二元分类问题，并且可以实现优异的统计性能。

Abstract: We study the classical binary classification problem for hypothesis spaces of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with ReLU activation under Tsybakov's low-noise
condition with exponent $q>0$, and its limit-case $q\to\infty$ which we refer
to as the "hard-margin condition". We show that DNNs which minimize the
empirical risk with square loss surrogate and $\ell_p$ penalty can achieve
finite-sample excess risk bounds of order $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-\alpha}\right)$
for arbitrarily large $\alpha>0$ under the hard-margin condition, provided that
the regression function $\eta$ is sufficiently smooth. The proof relies on a
novel decomposition of the excess risk which might be of independent interest.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as feature enhancers to optimize node
representations, which are then used as inputs for graph neural networks
(GNNs), has shown significant potential in graph representation learning.
However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To
address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this
issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a
synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling
precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide
data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to
examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their
underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results,
we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information
transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets
and models validate the proposed module.

Abstract: Multimodal learning enhances deep learning models by enabling them to
perceive and understand information from multiple data modalities, such as
visual and textual inputs. However, most existing approaches assume the
availability of all modalities, an assumption that often fails in real-world
applications. Recent works have introduced learnable missing-case-aware prompts
to mitigate performance degradation caused by missing modalities while reducing
the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Building upon the effectiveness of
missing-case-aware handling for missing modalities, we propose a novel
decoupled prototype-based output head, which leverages missing-case-aware
class-wise prototypes tailored for each individual modality. This approach
dynamically adapts to different missing modality scenarios and can be
seamlessly integrated with existing prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed output head significantly improves performance
across a wide range of missing-modality scenarios and varying missing rates.

Conclusion: 该剪枝框架为Mamba在资源受限环境中的部署提供了实用解决方案，并拓宽了其应用范围。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged
as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering
linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks.
However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for
deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel
unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to
70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance.
Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude
pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to
identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that
gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global
pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model.
Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT
time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with
minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's
components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and
robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings
while broadening Mamba's applicability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 多轮随机梯度下降（SGD）在非光滑随机凸优化（SCO）中的泛化性能研究显示，仅几轮训练就可能显著损害其样本外性能导致过拟合，步长选择尤为关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多轮SGD在SCO模型中的泛化性能，以理解其在实践中广泛使用但研究较少的现象。

Method: 分析不同步长和训练轮数对SGD样本外性能的影响，对比光滑与非光滑SCO情况的差异。

Result: 研究发现第二轮及以后的SGD可能导致Ω(1)的泛化损失，且泛化损失与步长和总步数有关。

Conclusion: 多轮SGD在非光滑SCO中易过拟合，步长和训练轮数需谨慎选择以平衡优化与泛化性能。

Abstract: We study the out-of-sample performance of multi-pass stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) in the fundamental stochastic convex optimization (SCO) model.
While one-pass SGD is known to achieve an optimal $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$ excess
population loss given a sample of size $n$, much less is understood about the
multi-pass version of the algorithm which is widely used in practice. Somewhat
surprisingly, we show that in the general non-smooth case of SCO, just a few
epochs of SGD can already hurt its out-of-sample performance significantly and
lead to overfitting. In particular, using a step size $\eta =
\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$, which gives the optimal rate after one pass, can lead to
population loss as large as $\Omega(1)$ after just one additional pass. More
generally, we show that the population loss from the second pass onward is of
the order $\Theta(1/(\eta T) + \eta \sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the total number
of steps. These results reveal a certain phase-transition in the out-of-sample
behavior of SGD after the first epoch, as well as a sharp separation between
the rates of overfitting in the smooth and non-smooth cases of SCO.
Additionally, we extend our results to with-replacement SGD, proving that the
same asymptotic bounds hold after $O(n \log n)$ steps. Finally, we also prove a
lower bound of $\Omega(\eta \sqrt{n})$ on the generalization gap of one-pass
SGD in dimension $d = \smash{\widetilde O}(n)$, improving on recent results of
Koren et al.(2022) and Schliserman et al.(2024).

Result: 在节点分类和鲁棒性认证方面达到SOTA性能，并首次实现严格超越1-WL的通用逼近。

Conclusion: SpecSphere证明了高表达性、异质适应性及可证明鲁棒性可在单一可扩展架构中并存。

Abstract: We introduce SpecSphere, the first dual-pass spectral-spatial GNN that
certifies every prediction against both $\ell\_{0}$ edge flips and
$\ell\_{\infty}$ feature perturbations, adapts to the full
homophily-heterophily spectrum, and surpasses the expressive power of
1-Weisfeiler-Lehman while retaining linear-time complexity. Our model couples a
Chebyshev-polynomial spectral branch with an attention-gated spatial branch and
fuses their representations through a lightweight MLP trained in a
cooperative-adversarial min-max game. We further establish (i) a uniform
Chebyshev approximation theorem, (ii) minimax-optimal risk across the
homophily-heterophily spectrum, (iii) closed-form robustness certificates, and
(iv) universal approximation strictly beyond 1-WL. SpecSphere achieves
state-of-the-art node-classification accuracy and delivers tighter certified
robustness guarantees on real-world benchmarks. These results demonstrate that
high expressivity, heterophily adaptation, and provable robustness can coexist
within a single, scalable architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据通常规模庞大且分散存储，由于数据共享限制和隐私问题，集中式模型训练难以实现。联邦学习（FL）虽提供解决方案，但现有研究缺乏真实的联邦数据集和基准测试。手动划分的单数据集无法捕捉真实遥感数据的异构性和规模，且实验设置不一致，阻碍公平比较。

Method: 作者提出FedRS数据集，包含八个涵盖不同传感器和分辨率的子集，构建了135个客户端，模拟真实场景中的标签分布倾斜、数据量不均衡和跨客户端域异构性。基于FedRS，开发了FedRSBench，实现了10种基线FL算法和评估指标。

Conclusion: FedRS-Bench通过提供丰富的数据集和基准测试，有望加速遥感领域的联邦学习研究，支持公平比较和规模化验证。相关代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images are usually produced at an unprecedented scale,
yet they are geographically and institutionally distributed, making centralized
model training challenging due to data-sharing restrictions and privacy
concerns. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative
model training across decentralized RS data sources without exposing raw data.
However, there lacks a realistic federated dataset and benchmark in RS. Prior
works typically rely on manually partitioned single dataset, which fail to
capture the heterogeneity and scale of real-world RS data, and often use
inconsistent experimental setups, hindering fair comparison. To address this
gap, we propose a realistic federated RS dataset, termed FedRS. FedRS consists
of eight datasets that cover various sensors and resolutions and builds 135
clients, which is representative of realistic operational scenarios. Data for
each client come from the same source, exhibiting authentic federated
properties such as skewed label distributions, imbalanced client data volumes,
and domain heterogeneity across clients. These characteristics reflect
practical challenges in federated RS and support evaluation of FL methods at
scale. Based on FedRS, we implement 10 baseline FL algorithms and evaluation
metrics to construct the comprehensive FedRS-Bench. The experimental results
demonstrate that FL can consistently improve model performance over training on
isolated data silos, while revealing performance trade-offs of different
methods under varying client heterogeneity and availability conditions. We hope
FedRS-Bench will accelerate research on large-scale, realistic FL in RS by
providing a standardized, rich testbed and facilitating fair comparisons across
future works. The source codes and dataset are available at
https://fedrs-bench.github.io/.

Motivation: 持续学习需要在稳定性和可塑性之间取得平衡，但现有大型预训练模型的高计算成本限制了实际应用。因此，研究如何通过模型压缩技术降低成本，同时保持性能。

Method: 提出了两种框架：1) 基于剪枝的框架，包含预剪枝和后剪枝策略，在不同训练阶段应用压缩；2) 基于知识蒸馏的框架，采用教师-学生架构，将预训练教师模型的知识迁移到紧凑的学生模型。

Result: 在多个类增量学习基准测试中，提出的框架在准确性和推理复杂度之间取得了更好的权衡，表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 模型压缩技术可以有效降低持续学习的计算成本，同时保持性能。两种框架在不同场景下各有优势，为实际应用提供了灵活的选择。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can learn a sequence of
tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A core challenge in CL
is balancing stability -- preserving performance on old tasks -- and plasticity
-- adapting to new ones. Recently, large pre-trained models have been widely
adopted in CL for their ability to support both, offering strong generalization
for new tasks and resilience against forgetting. However, their high
computational cost at inference time limits their practicality in real-world
applications, especially those requiring low latency or energy efficiency. To
address this issue, we explore model compression techniques, including pruning
and knowledge distillation (KD), and propose two efficient frameworks tailored
for class-incremental learning (CIL), a challenging CL setting where task
identities are unavailable during inference. The pruning-based framework
includes pre- and post-pruning strategies that apply compression at different
training stages. The KD-based framework adopts a teacher-student architecture,
where a large pre-trained teacher transfers downstream-relevant knowledge to a
compact student. Extensive experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed frameworks achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and
inference complexity, consistently outperforming strong baselines. We further
analyze the trade-offs between the two frameworks in terms of accuracy and
efficiency, offering insights into their use across different scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨RL-based HVAC控制在建筑节能中的潜力，并研究其在不同气候条件下的效果、对室内及局部城市气候的影响，以及策略在城市间的可转移性。

Method: 提出一个集成框架，结合强化学习和城市气候模型（包含建筑能耗模型），评估RL策略在多种背景气候下的表现及其对气候的影响。

Result: 不同气候城市的奖励（能耗与热舒适的平衡）及RL策略影响差异显著；热气候城市在多数奖励权重下表现更优，气温变化大的城市策略可转移性更强。

Conclusion: 需在多样化气候背景下全面评估RL-based HVAC控制策略；城市间学习可能助力RL策略的部署。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building
energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the
efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their
implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban
climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban
climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the
efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts
of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the
transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the
reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal
comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban
climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background
climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL
strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in
hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight
configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those
cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL
strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of
thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic
contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning
will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于当前最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合结构-时间耦合信息，显著提升了异常检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Detecting anomalous edges in dynamic graphs is an important task in many
applications over evolving triple-based data, such as social networks,
transaction management, and epidemiology. A major challenge with this task is
the absence of structural-temporal coupling information, which decreases the
ability of the representation to distinguish anomalies from normal instances.
Existing methods focus on handling independent structural and temporal features
with embedding models, which ignore the deep interaction between these two
types of information. In this paper, we propose a structural-temporal coupling
anomaly detection architecture with a dynamic graph transformer model.
Specifically, we introduce structural and temporal features from two
integration levels to provide anomaly-aware graph evolutionary patterns. Then,
a dynamic graph transformer enhanced by two-dimensional positional encoding is
implemented to capture both discrimination and contextual consistency signals.
Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
current state-of-the-art models. Finally, a case study illustrates the strength
of our method when applied to a real-world task.

Conclusion: 数据工程选择对解释方法具有不可忽视的影响，需警惕其潜在滥用风险，并呼吁进一步研究解释方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Local feature-based explanations are a key component of the XAI toolkit.
These explanations compute feature importance values relative to an
``interpretable'' feature representation. In tabular data, feature values
themselves are often considered interpretable. This paper examines the impact
of data engineering choices on local feature-based explanations. We demonstrate
that simple, common data engineering techniques, such as representing age with
a histogram or encoding race in a specific way, can manipulate feature
importance as determined by popular methods like SHAP. Notably, the sensitivity
of explanations to feature representation can be exploited by adversaries to
obscure issues like discrimination. While the intuition behind these results is
straightforward, their systematic exploration has been lacking. Previous work
has focused on adversarial attacks on feature-based explainers by biasing data
or manipulating models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating that explainers can be misled by standard, seemingly innocuous
data engineering techniques.

Motivation: 薄壁结构中的冲击会激发Lamb波，其分散特性使得传统方法难以精确定位冲击位置，因此需要一种更高效的方法来评估结构完整性。

Result: 即使在较小的数据集下，该方法仍能实现较高的冲击位置估计精度。

Conclusion: 基于GRU的RNNs结合真实物理数据训练，为薄壁结构冲击定位提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Today, machine learning is ubiquitous, and structural health monitoring (SHM)
is no exception. Specifically, we address the problem of impact localization on
shell-like structures, where knowledge of impact locations aids in assessing
structural integrity. Impacts on thin-walled structures excite Lamb waves,
which can be measured with piezoelectric sensors. Their dispersive
characteristics make it difficult to detect and localize impacts by
conventional methods. In the present contribution, we explore the localization
of impacts using neural networks. In particular, we propose to use {recurrent
neural networks} (RNNs) to estimate impact positions end-to-end, i.e., directly
from {sequential sensor data}. We deal with comparatively long sequences of
thousands of samples, since high sampling rate are needed to accurately capture
elastic waves. For this reason, the proposed approach builds upon Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are less prone to vanishing gradients as compared
to conventional RNNs. Quality and quantity of data are crucial when training
neural networks. Often, synthetic data is used, which inevitably introduces a
reality gap. Here, by contrast, we train our networks using {physical data from
experiments}, which requires automation to handle the large number of
experiments needed. For this purpose, a {robot is used to drop steel balls}
onto an {aluminum plate} equipped with {piezoceramic sensors}. Our results show
remarkable accuracy in estimating impact positions, even with a comparatively
small dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束或分数类方法在二元数据中效果不佳，无法公平比较不同类型变量的因果方向，需要一种无强分布假设且减少信息差异偏差的新方法。

Method: 通过分析连续变量在不同离散变量值下的条件密度比的单调性，判断因果方向，理论证明单调性仅在连续变量导致离散变量时存在。

Result: 实验证明该方法在合成和真实数据集中优于现有方法，准确识别因果方向。

Conclusion: 提出的方法解决了混合二元数据因果发现的挑战，无需强假设且避免信息偏差，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a causal discovery method for mixed bivariate data
consisting of one continuous and one discrete variable. Existing
constraint-based approaches are ineffective in the bivariate setting, as they
rely on conditional independence tests that are not suited to bivariate data.
Score-based methods either impose strong distributional assumptions or face
challenges in fairly comparing causal directions between variables of different
types, due to differences in their information content. We introduce a novel
approach that determines causal direction by analyzing the monotonicity of the
conditional density ratio of the continuous variable, conditioned on different
values of the discrete variable. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
conditional density ratio exhibits monotonicity when the continuous variable
causes the discrete variable, but not in the reverse direction. This property
provides a principled basis for comparing causal directions between variables
of different types, free from strong distributional assumptions and bias
arising from differences in their information content. We demonstrate its
effectiveness through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
showing superior accuracy compared to existing methods.

posterior approximation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency and
stability in model training. ConDiSim offers a robust and extensible framework
for simulation-based inference, particularly suitable for parameter inference
workflows requiring fast inference methods.

*Adel Ammar,Anis Koubaa,Omer Nacar,Wadii Boulila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了检索增强生成（RAG）系统中超参数对速度和性能的影响，发现速度与精度之间存在权衡，并提出优化配置可实现近乎完美的检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在任务表现中存在的幻觉或依赖过时知识的问题，通过检索增强生成技术提升生成内容的准确性和时效性。

Method: 分析了Chroma和Faiss向量存储、分块策略、交叉编码器重排序及温度等超参数的影响，并评估了六项指标：忠实性、答案正确性、答案相关性、上下文精确性、上下文召回率和答案相似性。

Result: Chroma查询速度快13%，Faiss检索精度更高；固定长度分块策略效率最佳；重排序略微提升质量但显著增加运行时；通过优化配置实现99%的上下文精确性。

Conclusion: RAG系统可通过合理配置超参数在高检索精度和计算成本间取得平衡，对下游任务（如医疗临床决策）有重要影响。

Abstract: Large language models achieve high task performance yet often hallucinate or
rely on outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses
these gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how
hyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and
Faiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and
temperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness,
answer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity.
Chroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval
precision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length
chunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic
segmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest
gains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so
its usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners
balance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for
transparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top
configurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages
persist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence. We obtain a
near-perfect context precision (99%), which demonstrates that RAG systems can
achieve extremely high retrieval accuracy with the right combination of
hyperparameters, with significant implications for applications where retrieval
quality directly impacts downstream task performance, such as clinical decision
support in healthcare.

*Chetra Mang,Axel TahmasebiMoradi,David Danan,Mouadh Yagoubi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应采样算法（ASADG）来生成更具代表性的输入数据，以解决传统方法在数据不平衡时难以准确建模的问题。该算法通过迭代添加输入数据点，优化响应流形的表示，并在谐波运输问题的元模型构建中表现优于LHS方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理模型使用偏微分方程（PDE）求解计算成本高，而基于数据的替代模型在输入数据分布不平衡时难以准确学习响应流形，导致预测精度不足。

Method: 提出自适应采样算法（ASADG），通过迭代向初始输入数据中添加新的数据点（基于单纯复形的重心和阈值条件），优化响应流形的表示。

Result: ASADG在谐波运输问题的元模型构建中，比LHS方法生成相同数量输入数据时能更准确地表示响应流形。

Conclusion: ASADG算法能有效改善输入数据的代表性，提升替代模型的预测精度，尤其在复杂物理模型的数据生成中具有优势。

Abstract: Physical models classically involved Partial Differential equations (PDE) and
depending of their underlying complexity and the level of accuracy required,
and known to be computationally expensive to numerically solve them. Thus, an
idea would be to create a surrogate model relying on data generated by such
solver. However, training such a model on an imbalanced data have been shown to
be a very difficult task. Indeed, if the distribution of input leads to a poor
response manifold representation, the model may not learn well and
consequently, it may not predict the outcome with acceptable accuracy. In this
work, we present an Adaptive Sampling Algorithm for Data Generation (ASADG)
involving a physical model. As the initial input data may not accurately
represent the response manifold in higher dimension, this algorithm iteratively
adds input data into it. At each step the barycenter of each simplicial
complex, that the manifold is discretized into, is added as new input data, if
a certain threshold is satisfied. We demonstrate the efficiency of the data
sampling algorithm in comparison with LHS method for generating more
representative input data. To do so, we focus on the construction of a harmonic
transport problem metamodel by generating data through a classical solver. By
using such algorithm, it is possible to generate the same number of input data
as LHS while providing a better representation of the response manifold.

*Adam Ulrich,Jan Krňávek,Roman Šenkeřík,Zuzana Komínková Oplatková,Radek Vala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的Half-Space Tree（HST）算法，专门用于新颖性检测任务，通过理论分析和比较验证了其高效性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的新颖性检测算法如One-Class SVM和LOF缺乏可解释性和可扩展性，因此需要一种更高效且易于解释的方法。

Result: 改进后的HST算法在新颖性检测中表现出更高的孤立性，优于原始Isolation Forest。

Conclusion: HST算法经过适当调整后，可作为高效且可解释的新颖性检测工具，为后续应用和实验提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Data mining offers a diverse toolbox for extracting meaningful structures
from complex datasets, with anomaly detection emerging as a critical subfield
particularly in the context of streaming or real-time data. Within anomaly
detection, novelty detection focuses on identifying previously unseen patterns
after training solely on regular data. While classic algorithms such as
One-Class SVM or Local Outlier Factor (LOF) have been widely applied, they
often lack interpretability and scalability. In this work, we explore the
Half-Space Tree (HST) algorithm, originally proposed for streaming anomaly
detection, and propose a novel theoretical modification to adapt it
specifically for novelty detection tasks. Our approach is grounded in the idea
that anomalies i.e., novelties tend to appear in the higher leaves of the tree,
which are less frequently visited by regular instances. We analytically
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using probabilistic analysis,
expected depth (EXD) calculations, and combinatorial reasoning. A comparative
analysis of expected depths between our modified HST and the original Isolation
Forest highlights that novelty points are significantly more isolated in our
approach. This supports the hypothesis that HSTs, with appropriate structural
adaptation, can serve as interpretable and efficient novelty detectors. The
paper contributes a theoretical foundation and supporting analysis for this
adaptation, setting the stage for further application and experimentation.

component analysis, the high dimension manifold is reduced to the lower
dimension manifold. Moreover, two approaches are developed to reconstruct the
inverse projector to project from the lower data component to the original one.
Afterward, we provide a detailed strategy to decompose the parametric domain
based on the low dimension manifold. Finally, numerical examples of harmonic
transport problem are given to illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of
the proposed method comparing to the classical meta-models such as neural
networks.

Motivation: 现有基于Bradley-Terry模型的偏好优化方法容易过拟合且在推理任务中表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效且不依赖强假设的方法来优化语言模型的偏好对齐。

Method: 提出InfoPO算法，通过避免对Bradley-Terry模型的依赖并防止选中回复的似然下降，更高效地利用偏好数据对齐语言模型。

Result: 实验表明，InfoPO在多个公开基准测试中表现优于现有基线方法，尤其在推理任务中效果显著。

Conclusion: InfoPO提供了一种更有效和稳定的偏好微调方法，尤其在提升推理能力方面具有优势。

Abstract: We study the post-training of large language models (LLMs) with human
preference data. Recently, direct preference optimization and its variants have
shown considerable promise in aligning language models, eliminating the need
for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, these methods
rely on explicit assumptions about the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, which makes
them prone to overfitting and results in suboptimal performance, particularly
on reasoning-heavy tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a principled
preference fine-tuning algorithm called InfoPO, which effectively and
efficiently aligns large language models using preference data. InfoPO
eliminates the reliance on the BT model and prevents the likelihood of the
chosen response from decreasing. Extensive experiments confirm that InfoPO
consistently outperforms established baselines on widely used open benchmarks,
particularly in reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AGF的新方法，将自注意力机制解释为图信号处理中的图滤波器学习，以线性复杂度在多项任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自注意力机制作为低通滤波器设计过于简化，无法有效利用多种频率信息，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Result: 实验表明，AGF在长序列基准和时间序列分类等任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AGF通过更高效地利用图信号处理的频率信息，显著提升了自注意力机制的性能。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains.
The key component of Transformers is self-attention, which learns the
relationship between any two tokens in the input sequence. Recent studies have
revealed that the self-attention can be understood as a normalized adjacency
matrix of a graph. Notably, from the perspective of graph signal processing
(GSP), the self-attention can be equivalently defined as a simple graph filter,
applying GSP using the value vector as the signal. However, the self-attention
is a graph filter defined with only the first order of the polynomial matrix,
and acts as a low-pass filter preventing the effective leverage of various
frequency information. Consequently, existing self-attention mechanisms are
designed in a rather simplified manner. Therefore, we propose a novel method,
called \underline{\textbf{A}}ttentive \underline{\textbf{G}}raph
\underline{\textbf{F}}ilter (AGF), interpreting the self-attention as learning
the graph filter in the singular value domain from the perspective of graph
signal processing for directed graphs with the linear complexity w.r.t. the
input length $n$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nd^2)$. In our experiments, we demonstrate
that AGF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including Long
Range Arena benchmark and time series classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习中，现有方法通常使用经验回放技术，但随机混合样本可能会损害先前任务的知识并导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出了GradMix方法，通过基于梯度和类别的选择性混合策略，仅混合有益类别对的样本。

Result: 实验表明，GradMix在多个真实数据集上通过最小化知识遗忘，在准确性上优于其他数据增强基准方法。

Conclusion: GradMix作为一种鲁棒的数据增强方法，显著减轻了类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: In the context of continual learning, acquiring new knowledge while
maintaining previous knowledge presents a significant challenge. Existing
methods often use experience replay techniques that store a small portion of
previous task data for training. In experience replay approaches, data
augmentation has emerged as a promising strategy to further improve the model
performance by mixing limited previous task data with sufficient current task
data. However, we theoretically and empirically analyze that training with
mixed samples from random sample pairs may harm the knowledge of previous tasks
and cause greater catastrophic forgetting. We then propose GradMix, a robust
data augmentation method specifically designed for mitigating catastrophic
forgetting in class-incremental learning. GradMix performs gradient-based
selective mixup using a class-based criterion that mixes only samples from
helpful class pairs and not from detrimental class pairs for reducing
catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments on various real datasets show that
GradMix outperforms data augmentation baselines in accuracy by minimizing the
forgetting of previous knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端事件对人类和生态系统构成重大风险，基础模型在灾害管理中表现潜力，但其训练数据的偏差可能影响性能。

Method: 引入 ExEBench 数据集，包含七种极端事件类别，覆盖全球、多源数据，并设计多种机器学习任务。

Result: ExEBench 旨在评估模型泛化性、促进新方法开发，并分析极端事件的交互作用。

Conclusion: 该数据集和代码公开，为气候变化下的地球系统研究提供了重要平台。

Abstract: Our planet is facing increasingly frequent extreme events, which pose major
risks to human lives and ecosystems. Recent advances in machine learning (ML),
especially with foundation models (FMs) trained on extensive datasets, excel in
extracting features and show promise in disaster management. Nevertheless,
these models often inherit biases from training data, challenging their
performance over extreme values. To explore the reliability of FM in the
context of extreme events, we introduce \textbf{ExE}Bench (\textbf{Ex}treme
\textbf{E}arth Benchmark), a collection of seven extreme event categories
across floods, wildfires, storms, tropical cyclones, extreme precipitation,
heatwaves, and cold waves. The dataset features global coverage, varying data
volumes, and diverse data sources with different spatial, temporal, and
spectral characteristics. To broaden the real-world impact of FMs, we include
multiple challenging ML tasks that are closely aligned with operational needs
in extreme events detection, monitoring, and forecasting. ExEBench aims to (1)
assess FM generalizability across diverse, high-impact tasks and domains, (2)
promote the development of novel ML methods that benefit disaster management,
and (3) offer a platform for analyzing the interactions and cascading effects
of extreme events to advance our understanding of Earth system, especially
under the climate change expected in the decades to come. The dataset and code
are public https://github.com/zhaoshan2/EarthExtreme-Bench.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于线性变换的多变量时间序列预测模型OLinear，通过正交变换解决时间序列依赖性问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测中，时间域的直接编码和解码可能因步骤依赖性而影响性能，因此需要更有效的数据变换方法。

Method: 采用正交矩阵变换（OrthoTrans）对时间序列进行解耦，并结合标准化线性层（NormLin）捕捉多变量依赖关系。

Result: 在24个基准和140个预测任务中，OLinear表现优异且高效，NormLin模块在计算量减半的情况下优于多头自注意力。

Conclusion: OLinear作为可插拔模块显著提升了现有模型性能，尤其适用于Transformer架构的改进。

Abstract: This paper presents $\mathbf{OLinear}$, a $\mathbf{linear}$-based
multivariate time series forecasting model that operates in an
$\mathbf{o}$rthogonally transformed domain. Recent forecasting models typically
adopt the temporal forecast (TF) paradigm, which directly encode and decode
time series in the time domain. However, the entangled step-wise dependencies
in series data can hinder the performance of TF. To address this, some
forecasters conduct encoding and decoding in the transformed domain using
fixed, dataset-independent bases (e.g., sine and cosine signals in the Fourier
transform). In contrast, we utilize $\mathbf{OrthoTrans}$, a data-adaptive
transformation based on an orthogonal matrix that diagonalizes the series'
temporal Pearson correlation matrix. This approach enables more effective
encoding and decoding in the decorrelated feature domain and can serve as a
plug-in module to enhance existing forecasters. To enhance the representation
learning for multivariate time series, we introduce a customized linear layer,
$\mathbf{NormLin}$, which employs a normalized weight matrix to capture
multivariate dependencies. Empirically, the NormLin module shows a surprising
performance advantage over multi-head self-attention, while requiring nearly
half the FLOPs. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks and 140 forecasting
tasks demonstrate that OLinear consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance with high efficiency. Notably, as a plug-in replacement for
self-attention, the NormLin module consistently enhances Transformer-based
forecasters. The code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了两种在线学习-遗忘算法（被动OLU和主动OLU），基于在线梯度下降（OGD），在保证统计不可区分性的同时实现与标准OGD相当的遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决在线学习中数据点删除后模型需保持统计不可区分性的问题，提出了一种新的学习-遗忘框架，确保后续输出与从未使用该数据的训练结果无法区分。

Method: 提出两种算法：1) 被动OLU，利用OGD的收缩特性并在遗忘时注入噪声；2) 主动OLU，结合离线遗忘算法调整模型以排除删除数据。两种方法均在凸性和平滑性假设下实现。

Result: 两种算法在标准假设下均达到与OGD相当的遗憾界，证明在提供遗忘保证的同时仍能保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了在线学习-遗忘的可行性，并为实际应用提供了高效且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We formalize the problem of online learning-unlearning, where a model is
updated sequentially in an online setting while accommodating unlearning
requests between updates. After a data point is unlearned, all subsequent
outputs must be statistically indistinguishable from those of a model trained
without that point. We present two online learner-unlearner (OLU) algorithms,
both built upon online gradient descent (OGD). The first, passive OLU,
leverages OGD's contractive property and injects noise when unlearning occurs,
incurring no additional computation. The second, active OLU, uses an offline
unlearning algorithm that shifts the model toward a solution excluding the
deleted data. Under standard convexity and smoothness assumptions, both methods
achieve regret bounds comparable to those of standard OGD, demonstrating that
one can maintain competitive regret bounds while providing unlearning
guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着法律框架对"被遗忘权"的要求增加，机器遗忘技术成为重要解决方案。但现有研究多局限于简化场景，缺乏统一评估框架，促使开发MUBox平台。

Method: MUBox整合23种先进遗忘方法，在6种实际场景中通过11项不同指标进行评估，支持方法对比、度量影响分析和统一框架下的比较研究。

Result: 研究发现：(a) 顶级遗忘方法在不同场景中表现不一致；(b) 需多种度量综合评估；(c) 去毒化效果高度依赖攻击类型。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘评估需要更全面的场景和多维度指标，MUBox为未来研究提供了标准化平台，揭示了当前技术的局限性。

Abstract: Recent legal frameworks have mandated the right to be forgotten, obligating
the removal of specific data upon user requests. Machine Unlearning has emerged
as a promising solution by selectively removing learned information from
machine learning models. This paper presents MUBox, a comprehensive platform
designed to evaluate unlearning methods in deep learning. MUBox integrates 23
advanced unlearning techniques, tested across six practical scenarios with 11
diverse evaluation metrics. It allows researchers and practitioners to (1)
assess and compare the effectiveness of different machine unlearning methods
across various scenarios; (2) examine the impact of current evaluation metrics
on unlearning performance; and (3) conduct detailed comparative studies on
machine unlearning in a unified framework. Leveraging MUBox, we systematically
evaluate these unlearning methods in deep learning and uncover several key
insights: (a) Even state-of-the-art unlearning methods, including those
published in top-tier venues and winners of unlearning competitions,
demonstrate inconsistent effectiveness across diverse scenarios. Prior research
has predominantly focused on simplified settings, such as random forgetting and
class-wise unlearning, highlighting the need for broader evaluations across
more difficult unlearning tasks. (b) Assessing unlearning performance remains a
non-trivial problem, as no single evaluation metric can comprehensively capture
the effectiveness, efficiency, and preservation of model utility. Our findings
emphasize the necessity of employing multiple metrics to achieve a balanced and
holistic assessment of unlearning methods. (c) In the context of depoisoning,
our evaluation reveals significant variability in the effectiveness of existing
approaches, which is highly dependent on the specific type of poisoning
attacks.

Abstract: There are various approaches to graph learning for data clustering,
incorporating different spectral and structural constraints through diverse
graph structures. Some methods rely on bipartite graph models, where nodes are
divided into two classes: centers and members. These models typically require
access to data for the center nodes in addition to observations from the member
nodes. However, such additional data may not always be available in many
practical scenarios. Moreover, popular Gaussian models for graph learning have
demonstrated limited effectiveness in modeling data with heavy-tailed
distributions, which are common in financial markets. In this paper, we propose
a clustering method based on a bipartite graph model that addresses these
challenges. First, it can infer clusters from incomplete data without requiring
information about the center nodes. Second, it is designed to effectively
handle heavy-tailed data. Numerical experiments using real financial data
validate the efficiency of the proposed method for data clustering.

Method: 采用迭代式最大熵逆向强化学习框架，引入权重优化步骤和自适应性步长调整策略。通过求解最优控制问题生成样本轨迹，而非随机采样，以提高信息量。

Result: 相比两种先进算法，提出的方法在多个模拟环境中表现更优，学习速度更快且样本效率更高，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法不仅解决了现有方法的局限性，还通过创新性设计（如自适应步长和最优控制采样）显著提升了性能，为连续空间中的逆向强化学习提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We present an iterative inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to infer
optimal cost functions in continuous spaces. Based on a popular maximum entropy
criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes
a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function
features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to
similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of
each observation for the partition function and does not need a large sample
set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an
optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative
trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art
algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments.

Abstract: Training cooperative agents in sparse-reward scenarios poses significant
challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Without clear
feedback on actions at each step in sparse-reward setting, previous methods
struggle with precise credit assignment among agents and effective exploration.
In this paper, we introduce a novel method to deal with both credit assignment
and exploration problems in reward-sparse domains. Accordingly, we propose an
algorithm that calculates the Influence Scope of Agents (ISA) on states by
taking specific value of the dimensions/attributes of states that can be
influenced by individual agents. The mutual dependence between agents' actions
and state attributes are then used to calculate the credit assignment and to
delimit the exploration space for each individual agent. We then evaluate ISA
in a variety of sparse-reward multi-agent scenarios. The results show that our
method significantly outperforms the state-of-art baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed machine learning training while
preserving privacy, representing a paradigm shift for data-sensitive and
decentralized environments. Despite its rapid advancements, FL remains a
complex and multifaceted field, requiring a structured understanding of its
methodologies, challenges, and applications. In this survey, we introduce a
meta-framework perspective, conceptualising FL as a composition of modular
components that systematically address core aspects such as communication,
optimisation, security, and privacy. We provide a historical contextualisation
of FL, tracing its evolution from distributed optimisation to modern
distributed learning paradigms. Additionally, we propose a novel taxonomy
distinguishing Aggregation from Alignment, introducing the concept of alignment
as a fundamental operator alongside aggregation. To bridge theory with
practice, we explore available FL frameworks in Python, facilitating real-world
implementation. Finally, we systematise key challenges across FL sub-fields,
providing insights into open research questions throughout the meta-framework
modules. By structuring FL within a meta-framework of modular components and
emphasising the dual role of Aggregation and Alignment, this survey provides a
holistic and adaptable foundation for understanding and advancing FL research

### [127] [AC-PKAN: Attention-Enhanced and Chebyshev Polynomial-Based Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08687)
*Hangwei Zhang,Zhimu Huang,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了AC-PKAN，一种增强的KAN架构，通过结合小波激活MLP和内外注意力机制，解决了Chebyshev1KAN的秩坍塌问题，并在多个基准任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始的KAN和Chebyshev1KAN在计算效率和表达能力上存在局限，尤其是秩坍塌问题限制了其解决PDE的能力。

Method: 引入小波激活MLP和内部注意力机制保持雅可比矩阵满秩，并采用RGA机制动态调整损失权重。

Result: 在9个基准任务中，AC-PKAN表现优于或匹配现有最佳模型（如PINNsFormer）。

Conclusion: AC-PKAN显著提升了KAN的表达能力，是解决复杂工程问题的有效工具。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently shown promise for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs). Yet their original formulation is
computationally and memory intensive, motivating the introduction of Chebyshev
Type-I-based KANs (Chebyshev1KANs). Although Chebyshev1KANs have outperformed
the vanilla KANs architecture, our rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that
they still suffer from rank collapse, ultimately limiting their expressive
capacity. To overcome these limitations, we enhance Chebyshev1KANs by
integrating wavelet-activated MLPs with learnable parameters and an internal
attention mechanism. We prove that this design preserves a full-rank Jacobian
and is capable of approximating solutions to PDEs of arbitrary order.
Furthermore, to alleviate the loss instability and imbalance introduced by the
Chebyshev polynomial basis, we externally incorporate a Residual Gradient
Attention (RGA) mechanism that dynamically re-weights individual loss terms
according to their gradient norms and residual magnitudes. By jointly
leveraging internal and external attention, we present AC-PKAN, a novel
architecture that constitutes an enhancement to weakly supervised
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and extends the expressive power of
KANs. Experimental results from nine benchmark tasks across three domains show
that AC-PKAN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such
as PINNsFormer, establishing it as a highly effective tool for solving complex
real-world engineering problems in zero-data or data-sparse regimes. The code
will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

*Yang Su,Na Yan,Yansha Deng,Robert Schober*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PWC-MoE的框架，通过动态路由敏感和非敏感数据到本地和云端专家模型，平衡计算成本、性能与隐私保护，适合带宽受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决云服务器上大型语言模型(LLMs)的隐私与带宽问题，以及本地小型语言模型(SLMs)性能不足的痛点。

Method: 采用稀疏隐私感知门控网络动态路由数据，结合负载均衡机制和带宽自适应的token卸载方案。

Result: 实验表明PWC-MoE在保护隐私的同时保持高性能，适用于带宽受限场景。

Conclusion: PWC-MoE为隐私敏感且带宽受限的环境提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud servers alleviate the
computational and storage burdens on local devices but raise privacy concerns
due to sensitive data transmission and require substantial communication
bandwidth, which is challenging in constrained environments. In contrast, small
language models (SLMs) running locally enhance privacy but suffer from limited
performance on complex tasks. To balance computational cost, performance, and
privacy protection under bandwidth constraints, we propose a privacy-aware
wireless collaborative mixture of experts (PWC-MoE) framework. Specifically,
PWC-MoE employs a sparse privacy-aware gating network to dynamically route
sensitive tokens to privacy experts located on local clients, while
non-sensitive tokens are routed to non-privacy experts located at the remote
base station. To achieve computational efficiency, the gating network ensures
that each token is dynamically routed to and processed by only one expert. To
enhance scalability and prevent overloading of specific experts, we introduce a
group-wise load-balancing mechanism for the gating network that evenly
distributes sensitive tokens among privacy experts and non-sensitive tokens
among non-privacy experts. To adapt to bandwidth constraints while preserving
model performance, we propose a bandwidth-adaptive and importance-aware token
offloading scheme. This scheme incorporates an importance predictor to evaluate
the importance scores of non-sensitive tokens, prioritizing the most important
tokens for transmission to the base station based on their predicted importance
and the available bandwidth. Experiments demonstrate that the PWC-MoE framework
effectively preserves privacy and maintains high performance even in
bandwidth-constrained environments, offering a practical solution for deploying
LLMs in privacy-sensitive and bandwidth-limited scenarios.

*Fangyuan Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出信息瓶颈语言建模（IBLM）目标，通过压缩内部表征提升泛化能力，并提出GAPT训练算法，动态切换记忆和压缩阶段，显著降低表征熵并提升泛化表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现数据规模和表征压缩均能提升泛化能力，通过模拟生物学习过程中的记忆-睡眠循环，提出优化训练方法。

Method: 引入IBLM目标，最小化表征熵的同时保持预测性能；设计GAPT算法，动态调整训练阶段以平衡记忆和压缩。

Result: 实验显示GAPT在GPT-2预训练中降低表征熵50%，提升交叉熵4.8%，OOD泛化提升35%，并显著减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GAPT通过模拟生物学习机制，有效优化预训练过程，为提升模型泛化和减少干扰提供新思路。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data
scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize
this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)
objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization
problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction
performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle
during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient
alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of
representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive
trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation
between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation,
we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively
switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2
pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves
cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining
task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate
catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and
separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation -
paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.

Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在组合优化中存在奖励信号衰减和组合动作空间探索效率低的问题，导致效率不佳。为了解决这些问题，论文提出了一种新的方法。

Method: 基于统计比较建模将定量奖励转化为偏好信号，重新参数化策略的奖励函数，并提出一种熵正则化的强化学习目标，同时结合局部搜索技术优化偏好对生成。

Result: 在TSP、CVRP和FFSP等基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有强化学习算法，收敛效率和解决方案质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Preference Optimization方法有效解决了强化学习在组合优化中的核心挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful tool for neural
combinatorial optimization, enabling models to learn heuristics that solve
complex problems without requiring expert knowledge. Despite significant
progress, existing RL approaches face challenges such as diminishing reward
signals and inefficient exploration in vast combinatorial action spaces,
leading to inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Preference Optimization, a
novel method that transforms quantitative reward signals into qualitative
preference signals via statistical comparison modeling, emphasizing the
superiority among sampled solutions. Methodologically, by reparameterizing the
reward function in terms of policy and utilizing preference models, we
formulate an entropy-regularized RL objective that aligns the policy directly
with preferences while avoiding intractable computations. Furthermore, we
integrate local search techniques into the fine-tuning rather than
post-processing to generate high-quality preference pairs, helping the policy
escape local optima. Empirical results on various benchmarks, such as the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem
(CVRP) and the Flexible Flow Shop Problem (FFSP), demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing RL algorithms, achieving superior
convergence efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: We present a (proto) Foundation Model for Nuclear Physics, capable of
operating on low-level detector inputs from Imaging Cherenkov Detectors at the
future Electron Ion Collider. To address limitations in existing next-token
prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack
of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate
vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined
via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic
conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and
simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint
vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel
and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in
the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction
tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to
leverage fine-tuning.

Motivation: 参数微分方程在科学和工程中非常重要，现有的深度学习方法如FNO在解决逆问题和灵敏度估计时表现不佳。

Method: 引入基于灵敏度的正则化策略SC-FNO，优化了FNO的性能。

Result: SC-FNO在预测解路径和参数反演任务中表现优于标准FNO，且适应高维参数空间。

Conclusion: SC-FNO有效提升了FNO的性能，适用于多种微分方程和神经算子。

Abstract: Parametric differential equations of the form du/dt = f(u, x, t, p) are
fundamental in science and engineering. While deep learning frameworks such as
the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) can efficiently approximate solutions, they
struggle with inverse problems, sensitivity estimation (du/dp), and concept
drift. We address these limitations by introducing a sensitivity-based
regularization strategy, called Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural
Operators (SC-FNO). SC-FNO achieves high accuracy in predicting solution paths
and consistently outperforms standard FNO and FNO with physics-informed
regularization. It improves performance in parameter inversion tasks, scales to
high-dimensional parameter spaces (tested with up to 82 parameters), and
reduces both data and training requirements. These gains are achieved with a
modest increase in training time (30% to 130% per epoch) and generalize across
various types of differential equations and neural operators. Code and selected
experiments are available at: https://github.com/AMBehroozi/SC_Neural_Operators

Abstract: Explainability in time series models is crucial for fostering trust,
facilitating debugging, and ensuring interpretability in real-world
applications. In this work, we introduce Implet, a novel post-hoc explainer
that generates accurate and concise subsequence-level explanations for time
series models. Our approach identifies critical temporal segments that
significantly contribute to the model's predictions, providing enhanced

Conclusion: SPAT证明了保留关键注意力机制的重要性，同时显著提升效率和性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Attention-based architectures have achieved superior performance in
multivariate time series forecasting but are computationally expensive.
Techniques such as patching and adaptive masking have been developed to reduce
their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning
method, SPAT ($\textbf{S}$ensitivity $\textbf{P}$runer for
$\textbf{At}$tention), which selectively removes redundant attention mechanisms
and yields highly effective models. Different from previous approaches, SPAT
aims to remove the entire attention module, which reduces the risk of
overfitting and enables speed-up without demanding specialized hardware. We
propose a dynamic sensitivity metric, $\textbf{S}$ensitivity
$\textbf{E}$nhanced $\textbf{N}$ormalized $\textbf{D}$ispersion (SEND) that
measures the importance of each attention module during the pre-training phase.
Experiments on multivariate datasets demonstrate that SPAT-pruned models
achieve reductions of 2.842% in MSE, 1.996% in MAE, and 35.274% in FLOPs.
Furthermore, SPAT-pruned models outperform existing lightweight, Mamba-based
and LLM-based SOTA methods in both standard and zero-shot inference,
highlighting the importance of retaining only the most effective attention
mechanisms. We have made our code publicly available

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds significant promise for solving
computational challenges across diverse domains. However, its practical
deployment is constrained by the limitations of noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, including noise, limited scalability, and trainability
issues in variational quantum circuits (VQCs). We introduce the multi-chip
ensemble VQC framework, which partitions high-dimensional computations across
smaller quantum chips to enhance scalability, trainability, and noise
resilience. We show that this approach mitigates barren plateaus, reduces
quantum error bias and variance, and maintains robust generalization through
controlled entanglement. Designed to align with current and emerging quantum
hardware, the framework demonstrates strong potential for enabling scalable QML
on near-term devices, as validated by experiments on standard benchmark
datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10) and real world dataset (PhysioNet
EEG).

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to modeling physical
systems, yet solving them remains a complex challenge. Traditional numerical
solvers rely on expert knowledge to implement and are computationally
expensive, while neural-network-based solvers require large training datasets
and often lack interpretability. In this work, we frame PDE solving as a code
generation task and introduce CodePDE, the first inference framework for
generating PDE solvers using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging advanced
inference-time algorithms and scaling strategies, CodePDE unlocks critical
capacities of LLM for PDE solving: reasoning, debugging, selfrefinement, and
test-time scaling -- all without task-specific tuning. CodePDE achieves
superhuman performance across a range of representative PDE problems. We also
present a systematic empirical analysis of LLM generated solvers, analyzing
their accuracy, efficiency, and numerical scheme choices. Our findings
highlight the promise and the current limitations of LLMs in PDE solving,
offering a new perspective on solver design and opportunities for future model
development. Our code is available at https://github.com/LithiumDA/CodePDE.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多路径优化算法，用于公共场所枪击事件中的紧急疏散，通过考虑路径容量减少拥挤和瓶颈，从而显著降低伤亡率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国2016至2022年发生3400多起公共场所枪击事件，其中教育机构、办公场所、零售店和餐厅占比高。紧急疏散时，压力和信息不足可能导致错误决策，亟需优化疏散策略。

Method: 开发了一种多路径路由优化算法，为每个疏散者提供多条最优安全路线，同时考虑路径容量以减少拥挤和瓶颈。

Result: 相比无容量约束的旧算法和专家建议策略，新算法分别减少34.16%和53.3%的伤亡率，关键瓶颈节点占用率降低约50%。

Conclusion: 多路径优化算法能有效提升紧急疏散效率，显著减少伤亡和拥挤，为公共安全提供技术解决方案。

Abstract: A total of more than 3400 public shootings have occurred in the United States
between 2016 and 2022. Among these, 25.1% of them took place in an educational
institution, 29.4% at the workplace including office buildings, 19.6% in retail
store locations, and 13.4% in restaurants and bars. During these critical
scenarios, making the right decisions while evacuating can make the difference
between life and death. However, emergency evacuation is intensely stressful,
which along with the lack of verifiable real-time information may lead to fatal
incorrect decisions. To tackle this problem, we developed a multi-route routing
optimization algorithm that determines multiple optimal safe routes for each
evacuee while accounting for available capacity along the route, thus reducing
the threat of crowding and bottlenecking. Overall, our algorithm reduces the
total casualties by 34.16% and 53.3%, compared to our previous routing
algorithm without capacity constraints and an expert-advised routing strategy
respectively. Further, our approach to reduce crowding resulted in an
approximate 50% reduction in occupancy in key bottlenecking nodes compared to
both of the other evacuation algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的RAN AI模块缺乏对历史事件的记忆，导致无法利用网络动态的重复模式优化决策。

Method: 设计了包含上下文编码器、向量存储、召回引擎和策略接口的模块化架构，兼容O-RAN标准。

Result: 在体育场流量缓解和无人机走廊移动管理等案例中，上下文记忆显著提升了RAN的适应性和连续性。

Conclusion: RAN Cortex为AI原生RAN设计引入了内存机制，无需重新训练即可实现学习型代理。

Abstract: As Radio Access Networks (RAN) evolve toward AI-native architectures,
intelligent modules such as xApps and rApps are expected to make increasingly
autonomous decisions across scheduling, mobility, and resource management
domains. However, these agents remain fundamentally stateless, treating each
decision as isolated, lacking any persistent memory of prior events or
outcomes. This reactive behavior constrains optimization, especially in
environments where network dynamics exhibit episodic or recurring patterns. In
this work, we propose RAN Cortex, a memory-augmented architecture that enables
contextual recall in AI-based RAN decision systems. RAN Cortex introduces a
modular layer composed of four elements: a context encoder that transforms
network state into high-dimensional embeddings, a vector-based memory store of
past network episodes, a recall engine to retrieve semantically similar
situations, and a policy interface that supplies historical context to AI
agents in real time or near-real time. We formalize the retrieval-augmented
decision problem in the RAN, present a system architecture compatible with
O-RAN interfaces, and analyze feasible deployments within the Non-RT and
Near-RT RIC domains. Through illustrative use cases such as stadium traffic
mitigation and mobility management in drone corridors, we demonstrate how
contextual memory improves adaptability, continuity, and overall RAN
intelligence. This work introduces memory as a missing primitive in AI-native
RAN designs and provides a framework to enable "learning agents" without the
need for retraining or centralized inference

Motivation: 研究前沿LLMs在面对不可能任务时的行为，揭示潜在的安全和对齐问题，为AI安全提供警示。

Method: 采用文本模拟方法，测试三种主流LLMs在无解井字棋场景中的行为，分析其利用漏洞的倾向。

Result: 新型推理模型（o3-mini）的漏洞利用倾向是旧模型（o1）的两倍；提示方式对行为影响显著，要求“创意”时漏洞利用率飙升至77.3%。

Conclusion: 即使无执行能力，LLMs仍能通过漏洞提出复杂攻击策略，凸显AI对齐的紧迫性，尤其随着模型能力提升。

Abstract: This study reveals how frontier Large Language Models LLMs can "game the
system" when faced with impossible situations, a critical security and
alignment concern. Using a novel textual simulation approach, we presented
three leading LLMs (o1, o3-mini, and r1) with a tic-tac-toe scenario designed
to be unwinnable through legitimate play, then analyzed their tendency to
exploit loopholes rather than accept defeat. Our results are alarming for
security researchers: the newer, reasoning-focused o3-mini model showed nearly
twice the propensity to exploit system vulnerabilities (37.1%) compared to the
older o1 model (17.5%). Most striking was the effect of prompting. Simply
framing the task as requiring "creative" solutions caused gaming behaviors to
skyrocket to 77.3% across all models. We identified four distinct exploitation
strategies, from direct manipulation of game state to sophisticated
modification of opponent behavior. These findings demonstrate that even without
actual execution capabilities, LLMs can identify and propose sophisticated
system exploits when incentivized, highlighting urgent challenges for AI
alignment as models grow more capable of identifying and leveraging
vulnerabilities in their operating environments.

Method: 通过逻辑与形式化方法，定义了多代理动态社交世界的概念，包括代理的不确定性、意图状态、能力与沟通的语义和语用关系，并形式化了代理能力和意图的逻辑。

Result: 提出了社交代理的最小架构，定义了群体战略状态的熵，揭示了信息、意图与战略思维之间的非经典逻辑联系。

Conclusion: 社交智能的逻辑超越了经典逻辑，通过将信息与战略思维结合，为多代理社会的协调与合作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: What makes a society possible at all? How is coordination and cooperation in
social activity possible? What is the minimal mental architecture of a social
agent? How is the information about the state of the world related to the
agents intentions? How are the intentions of agents related? What role does
communication play in this coordination process? This essay explores the
conceptual and logical foundations of artificial social intelligence in the
context of a society of multiple agents that communicate and cooperate to
achieve some end. An attempt is made to provide an introduction to some of the
key concepts, their formal definitions and their interrelationships. These
include the notion of a changing social world of multiple agents. The logic of
social intelligence goes beyond classical logic by linking information with
strategic thought. A minimal architecture of social agents is presented. The
agents have different dynamically changing, possible choices and abilities. The
agents also have uncertainty, lacking perfect information about their physical
state as well as their dynamic social state. The social state of an agent
includes the intentional state of that agent, as well as, that agent's
representation of the intentional states of other agents. Furthermore, it
includes the evaluations agents make of their physical and social condition.
Communication, semantic and pragmatic meaning and their relationship to
intention and information states are investigated. The logic of agent abilities
and intentions are motivated and formalized. The entropy of group strategic
states is defined.

Collaborative Multi-dimensional Course Learning (CCL), a novel curriculum
learning framework that addresses this by (1) refining intermediate tasks for
individual agents, (2) using a variational evolutionary algorithm to generate
informative subtasks, and (3) co-evolving agents with their environment to
enhance training stability. Experiments on five cooperative tasks in the MPE
and Hide-and-Seek environments show that CCL outperforms existing methods in
sparse reward settings.

*Takamitsu Omasa,Ryo Koshihara,Masumi Morishige*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种七阶段流程，通过箭头感知检测、OCR文本提取和结构化提示构建，显著提高了视觉语言模型对流程图的解析准确率，特别是针对下一步查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型常误解流程图的方向箭头和拓扑结构，导致解析不准确，需要一种改进方法。

Method: 采用七阶段流程，分为箭头感知检测、OCR文本提取和结构化提示构建三部分，无需任务特定微调。

Result: 在90个问题的基准测试中，准确率从80%提升至89%，尤其在下一步查询中表现突出（100%准确率）。

Conclusion: 显式编码箭头能显著提升模型表现，未来将扩展基准测试并评估其他建模语言的应用。

Abstract: Flowcharts are indispensable tools in software design and business-process
analysis, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) frequently misinterpret the
directional arrows and graph topology that set these diagrams apart from
natural images. We introduce a seven-stage pipeline grouped into three broader
processes: (1) arrow-aware detection of nodes and arrow endpoints; (2) optical
character recognition (OCR) to extract node text; and (3) construction of a
structured prompt that guides the VLMs. Tested on a 90-question benchmark
distilled from 30 annotated flowcharts, the method raises overall accuracy from
80 % to 89 % (+9 percentage points) without any task-specific fine-tuning. The
gain is most pronounced for next-step queries (25/30 -> 30/30; 100 %, +17 pp);
branch-result questions improve more modestly, and before-step questions remain
difficult. A parallel evaluation with an LLM-as-a-Judge protocol shows the same
trends, reinforcing the advantage of explicit arrow encoding. Limitations
include dependence on detector and OCR precision, the small evaluation set, and
residual errors at nodes with multiple incoming edges. Future work will enlarge
the benchmark with synthetic and handwritten flowcharts and assess the approach
on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language
(UML).

Abstract: Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) operate in dynamic, open, and
multi-domain networks, rendering them vulnerable to various threats. Trust
Management Systems (TMS) systematically organize essential steps in the trust
mechanism, identifying malicious nodes against internal threats and external
threats, as well as ensuring reliable decision-making for more cooperative
tasks. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer significant potential to
enhance TMS, especially for the strict requirements of CAVs, such as CAV nodes
moving at varying speeds, and opportunistic and intermittent network behavior.
Those features distinguish ML-based TMS from social networks, static IoT, and
Social IoT. This survey proposes a novel three-layer ML-based TMS framework for
CAVs in the vehicle-road-cloud integration system, i.e., trust data layer,
trust calculation layer and trust incentive layer. A six-dimensional taxonomy
of objectives is proposed. Furthermore, the principles of ML methods for each
module in each layer are analyzed. Then, recent studies are categorized based
on traffic scenarios that are against the proposed objectives. Finally, future
directions are suggested, addressing the open issues and meeting the research
trend. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature and
open-source projects at

Motivation: 理解GNN的表达能力是一个重要问题，本文旨在通过将GNN与一阶逻辑片段对应来解决这一问题。

Method: 应用有限模型理论的方法和工具，将GNN的表达能力映射到一阶逻辑的特定片段，包括模态逻辑（ML）、分级模态逻辑（GML）等。

Result: 证明了有界GNN架构对应于特定的一阶逻辑片段，为GNN的逻辑表达能力提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 本文为GNN的逻辑表达能力提供了一个统一的理论框架，有助于进一步理解和设计GNN模型。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) address two key challenges in applying deep
learning to graph-structured data: they handle varying size input graphs and
ensure invariance under graph isomorphism. While GNNs have demonstrated broad
applicability, understanding their expressive power remains an important
question. In this paper, we show that bounded GNN architectures correspond to
specific fragments of first-order logic (FO), including modal logic (ML),
graded modal logic (GML), modal logic with the universal modality (ML(A)), the
two-variable fragment (FO2) and its extension with counting quantifiers (C2).
To establish these results, we apply methods and tools from finite model theory
of first-order and modal logics to the domain of graph representation learning.
This provides a unifying framework for understanding the logical expressiveness
of GNNs within FO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出，人类在两臂伯努利多臂老虎机任务中的行为看似存在确认偏误和积极性偏误，但实际上即使通过贝叶斯推断更新信念，标准的Q学习模型仍会恢复这些偏误。研究通过主方程分析发现，确认偏误与无偏但递减的学习率会表现出相同的行为特征，并提出了区分两者影响的实验方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究认为人类在两臂伯努利多臂老虎机任务中表现出确认偏误和积极性偏误，但作者质疑这些偏误是否真的源于认知偏差，还是统计建模的结果。

Method: 研究通过贝叶斯推断将问题转化为Q学习算法，分析学习率的对称性与递减性，并用主方程对学习系统的随机动态进行建模。

Result: 研究发现，即使学习是无偏的（基于贝叶斯推断），递减的学习率也会导致行为数据中出现类似确认偏误的特征。

Conclusion: 论文提出需要通过实验设计区分真正的认知偏误和学习率递减造成的统计假象。

Abstract: Recent studies claim that human behavior in a two-armed Bernoulli bandit
(TABB) task is described by positivity and confirmation biases, implying that
humans do not integrate new information objectively. However, we find that even
if the agent updates its belief via objective Bayesian inference, fitting the
standard Q-learning model with asymmetric learning rates still recovers both
biases. Bayesian inference cast as an effective Q-learning algorithm has
symmetric, though decreasing, learning rates. We explain this by analyzing the
stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using master equations. We find
that both confirmation bias and unbiased but decreasing learning rates yield
the same behavioral signatures. Finally, we propose experimental protocols to
disentangle true cognitive biases from artifacts of decreasing learning rates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用世界模型（World Models）和反向世界模型（Reverse World Model）为基于模型的深度强化学习（RL）代理生成解释的方法，以帮助非AI专家理解代理行为并学习如何通过环境控制代理的执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释AI（XAI）系统旨在帮助人们理解AI系统的决策行为，但在强化学习（RL）中，由于序列决策的时序性，解释更为复杂。现有方法未能充分解释代理行为背后的原因，也无法帮助用户学习如何通过环境操控代理。

Method: 通过结合世界模型（预测行动后世界状态）和反向世界模型（预测代理偏好某行动所需的世界状态），为基于模型的RL代理生成解释，包括反事实轨迹和代理行为的潜在原因。

Result: 实验表明，展示用户“世界本应是怎样”的解释显著提升了他们对代理策略的理解，并能帮助用户学习如何通过环境调整控制代理行为。

Conclusion: 反向世界模型增强的解释方法有效提升了强化学习代理的可解释性，为非AI专家理解并操控代理行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) systems have been proposed to help people understand how
AI systems produce outputs and behaviors. Explainable Reinforcement Learning
(XRL) has an added complexity due to the temporal nature of sequential
decision-making. Further, non-AI experts do not necessarily have the ability to
alter an agent or its policy. We introduce a technique for using World Models
to generate explanations for Model-Based Deep RL agents. World Models predict
how the world will change when actions are performed, allowing for the
generation of counterfactual trajectories. However, identifying what a user
wanted the agent to do is not enough to understand why the agent did something
else. We augment Model-Based RL agents with a Reverse World Model, which
predicts what the state of the world should have been for the agent to prefer a
given counterfactual action. We show that explanations that show users what the
world should have been like significantly increase their understanding of the
agent policy. We hypothesize that our explanations can help users learn how to
control the agents execution through by manipulating the environment.

### [147] [Lost in Transmission: When and Why LLMs Fail to Reason Globally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08140)
*Tobias Schnabel,Kiran Tomlinson,Adith Swaminathan,Jennifer Neville*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Transformer-based LLMs struggle with complex reasoning due to limited information bandwidth in attention heads, formalized by the BAPO model. Tasks like graph reachability are 'BAPO-hard' and fail in models like GPT-4, but CoT can make them 'BAPO-easy'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing LLMs' limitations in complex reasoning tasks caused by constrained internal communication bandwidth.

Method: Introduces the BAPO model to quantify attention head bandwidth constraints and tests on tasks like graph reachability.

Result: LLMs fail on BAPO-hard tasks but succeed when CoT is applied, converting them to BAPO-easy.

Conclusion: BAPO explains key LLM failures and suggests CoT as a solution, guiding future architecture improvements.

Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs)
continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts
of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on
the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we
introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational
framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism
for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning
problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs
to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our
theoretical predictions: GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks
and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another
benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT
can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer
principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for
architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

Conclusion: 该策略成功实现了零样本泛化的电池退化预测，并通过知识蒸馏解决了大模型部署的挑战，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical
for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional
expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations.
With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of
general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However,
foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain
largely unexplored. To enable zero-shot generalization in battery degradation
prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a
degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We
apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of
open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released
CycleLife-SJTUIE dataset demonstrates that the fine-tuned Battery-Timer
possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation
forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models,
we further propose a knowledge distillation framework that transfers the
knowledge of pre-trained foundation models into compact expert models.
Distillation results across several state-of-the-art time-series expert models
confirm that foundation model knowledge significantly improves the
multi-condition generalization of expert models.

<details>

Motivation: 当前神经符号搜索方法在知识图推理中虽然准确性高，但由于数据复杂度和查询复杂度的瓶颈，难以扩展到大型知识图和复杂查询。

Method: 作者提出了两种约束策略用于计算神经逻辑索引以缩小变量域，从而降低符号搜索的数据复杂度，并引入基于局部搜索的近似算法处理循环查询的NP复杂度问题。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多个CQA基准测试中将符号方法的计算负载降低了90%，同时保持几乎相同的性能，显著缓解了效率和可扩展性问题。

Conclusion: 该框架通过优化符号搜索的计算复杂度，为解决知识图推理中的效率和可扩展性挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Complex Query Answering (CQA) aims to retrieve answer sets for complex
logical formulas from incomplete knowledge graphs, which is a crucial yet
challenging task in knowledge graph reasoning. While neuro-symbolic search
utilized neural link predictions achieve superior accuracy, they encounter
significant complexity bottlenecks: (i) Data complexity typically scales
quadratically with the number of entities in the knowledge graph, and (ii)
Query complexity becomes NP-hard for cyclic queries. Consequently, these
approaches struggle to effectively scale to larger knowledge graphs and more
complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and
scalable symbolic search framework. First, we propose two constraint strategies
to compute neural logical indices to reduce the domain of variables, thereby
decreasing the data complexity of symbolic search. Additionally, we introduce
an approximate algorithm based on local search to tackle the NP query
complexity of cyclic queries. Experiments on various CQA benchmarks demonstrate
that our framework reduces the computational load of symbolic methods by 90\%
while maintaining nearly the same performance, thus alleviating both efficiency
and scalability issues.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了用大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT和Gemini来解码社区环境的可行性，通过训练YOLOv11模型取得了99.13%的准确率，并结合多数表决法在四个LLMs中实现了88%的准确率，显示了LLMs的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估社区环境的方法（如实地调查和GIS）资源密集且难以扩展，而机器学习虽能自动化分析，但数据标注和模型可用性问题限制了其扩展性，因此研究转向探索LLMs的可行性。

Method: 研究训练了一个YOLOv11模型检测六类环境指标（如人行道、电线），并评估四个LLMs（ChatGPT、Gemini、Claude、Grok）的表现，关注提示策略和微调的影响，最后用多数表决法结合前三名LLMs提升准确率。

Result: YOLOv11模型在六类指标检测上平均准确率达99.13%，四个LLMs经多数表决后整体准确率超过88%。

Conclusion: LLMs无需训练即可用于社区环境解码，尽管存在局限性，但仍展现了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Neighborhood environments include physical and environmental conditions such
as housing quality, roads, and sidewalks, which significantly influence human
health and well-being. Traditional methods for assessing these environments,
including field surveys and geographic information systems (GIS), are
resource-intensive and challenging to evaluate neighborhood environments at
scale. Although machine learning offers potential for automated analysis, the
laborious process of labeling training data and the lack of accessible models
hinder scalability. This study explores the feasibility of large language
models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini as tools for decoding neighborhood
environments (e.g., sidewalk and powerline) at scale. We train a robust
YOLOv11-based model, which achieves an average accuracy of 99.13% in detecting
six environmental indicators, including streetlight, sidewalk, powerline,
apartment, single-lane road, and multilane road. We then evaluate four LLMs,
including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok, to assess their feasibility,
robustness, and limitations in identifying these indicators, with a focus on
the impact of prompting strategies and fine-tuning. We apply majority voting
with the top three LLMs to achieve over 88% accuracy, which demonstrates LLMs
could be a useful tool to decode the neighborhood environment without any
training effort.

Result: 在真实地球生物化学成像数据中验证有效，能可靠降噪并揭示空间和化学特征。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现高效降噪，还能驱动有意义表征的涌现，支持资源受限下的实验设计。

Abstract: Scientific imaging often involves long acquisition times to obtain
high-quality data, especially when probing complex, heterogeneous systems.
However, reducing acquisition time to increase throughput inevitably introduces
significant noise into the measurements. We present a machine learning approach
that not only denoises low-quality measurements with calibrated uncertainty
bounds, but also reveals emergent structure in the latent space. By using
ensembles of lightweight, randomly structured neural networks trained via
conformal quantile regression, our method performs reliable denoising while
uncovering interpretable spatial and chemical features -- without requiring
labels or segmentation. Unlike conventional approaches focused solely on image
restoration, our framework leverages the denoising process itself to drive the
emergence of meaningful representations. We validate the approach on real-world
geobiochemical imaging data, showing how it supports confident interpretation
and guides experimental design under resource constraints.

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
variety of downstream tasks, including speech intelligibility prediction for
hearing-impaired people (SIP-HI). However, optimizing SFMs for SIP-HI has been
insufficiently explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to
identify key design factors affecting SIP-HI performance with 5 SFMs, focusing
on encoder layer selection, prediction head architecture, and ensemble
configurations. Our findings show that, contrary to traditional use-all-layers
methods, selecting a single encoder layer yields better results. Additionally,
temporal modeling is crucial for effective prediction heads. We also
demonstrate that ensembling multiple SFMs improves performance, with stronger
individual models providing greater benefit. Finally, we explore the
relationship between key SFM attributes and their impact on SIP-HI performance.
Our study offers practical insights into effectively adapting SFMs for speech
intelligibility prediction for hearing-impaired populations.

Conclusion: 结论强调需要开发更贴近真实使用场景的评估基准，并证实了以用户为中心的实用性指标对模型比较的价值。

Abstract: As generative AI becomes increasingly embedded in everyday workflows, it is
important to evaluate its performance in ways that reflect real-world usage
rather than abstract notions of intelligence. Unlike many existing benchmarks
that assess general intelligence, our approach focuses on real-world utility,
evaluating how well models support users in everyday tasks. While current
benchmarks emphasize code generation or factual recall, users rely on AI for a
much broader range of activities-from writing assistance and summarization to
citation formatting and stylistic feedback. In this paper, we analyze
large-scale survey data and usage logs to identify six core capabilities that
represent how people commonly use Large Language Models (LLMs): Summarization,
Technical Assistance, Reviewing Work, Data Structuring, Generation, and
Information Retrieval. We then assess the extent to which existing benchmarks
cover these capabilities, revealing significant gaps in coverage, efficiency
measurement, and interpretability. Drawing on this analysis, we use
human-centered criteria to identify gaps in how well current benchmarks reflect
common usage that is grounded in five practical criteria: coherence, accuracy,
clarity, relevance, and efficiency. For four of the six capabilities, we
identify the benchmarks that best align with real-world tasks and use them to
compare leading models. We find that Google Gemini outperforms other
models-including OpenAI's GPT, xAI's Grok, Meta's LLaMA, Anthropic's Claude,
DeepSeek, and Qwen from Alibaba-on these utility-focused metrics.

Abstract: The rise of large language models and multi-agent systems has sparked growing
interest in AI scientists capable of autonomous biological research. However,
existing benchmarks either focus on reasoning without data or on data analysis
with predefined statistical answers, lacking realistic, data-driven evaluation
settings. Here, we introduce the Biological AI Scientist Benchmark (BaisBench),
a benchmark designed to assess AI scientists' ability to generate biological
discoveries through data analysis and reasoning with external knowledge.
BaisBench comprises two tasks: cell type annotation on 31 expert-labeled
single-cell datasets, and scientific discovery through answering 198
multiple-choice questions derived from the biological insights of 41 recent
single-cell studies. Systematic experiments on state-of-the-art AI scientists
and LLM agents showed that while promising, current models still substantially
underperform human experts on both tasks. We hope BaisBench will fill this gap
and serve as a foundation for advancing and evaluating AI models for scientific
discovery. The benchmark can be found at: https://github.com/EperLuo/BaisBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于反事实推理的最小成本因果决策框架（MiCCD），用于在异常条件下优化决策，考虑了动作成本并整合了因果机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策框架在异常条件下常忽视动作成本或因果机制，导致效率低下。

Method: 通过因果图构建替代模型，利用异常模式聚类标签进行监督，识别因果结构并优化干预策略。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于传统方法，F1分数、成本效率和nDCG@k值均有提升。

Conclusion: MiCCD框架有效且适用性广，为异常决策提供了更优方案。

Abstract: Decision making under abnormal conditions is a critical process that involves
evaluating the current state and determining the optimal action to restore the
system to a normal state at an acceptable cost. However, in such scenarios,
existing decision-making frameworks highly rely on reinforcement learning or
root cause analysis, resulting in them frequently neglecting the cost of the
actions or failing to incorporate causal mechanisms adequately. By relaxing the
existing causal decision framework to solve the necessary cause, we propose a
minimum-cost causal decision (MiCCD) framework via counterfactual reasoning to
address the above challenges. Emphasis is placed on making counterfactual
reasoning processes identifiable in the presence of a large amount of mixed
anomaly data, as well as finding the optimal intervention state in a continuous
decision space. Specifically, it formulates a surrogate model based on causal
graphs, using abnormal pattern clustering labels as supervisory signals. This
enables the approximation of the structural causal model among the variables
and lays a foundation for identifiable counterfactual reasoning. With the
causal structure approximated, we then established an optimization model based
on counterfactual estimation. The Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP)
algorithm is further employed to optimize intervention strategies while taking
costs into account. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world
datasets reveal that MiCCD outperforms conventional methods across multiple
metrics, including F1-score, cost efficiency, and ranking quality(nDCG@k
values), thus validating its efficacy and broad applicability.

Modeling with Compositional Causal Components (WM3C). This novel framework
enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal
components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation
learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among
composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach
integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space
into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique
identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a
masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity
regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively
disentangle transition dynamics. Experiments on numerical simulations and
real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that WM3C significantly
outperforms existing methods in identifying latent processes, improving policy
learning, and generalizing to unseen tasks.

*Enci Zhang,Xingang Yan,Wei Lin,Tianxiang Zhang,Qianchun Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新策略（ADCL和EGSR）来提升大语言模型解决复杂问题的能力，实验表明这些策略显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学推理等领域取得了进展，但在解决复杂问题时仍面临挑战。论文受人类学习策略启发，希望通过自适应难度课程学习和专家引导的自我重构来提升模型能力。

Method: 提出了两种策略：自适应难度课程学习（ADCL）和专家引导的自我重构（EGSR）。ADCL通过动态调整问题难度与模型能力对齐，EGSR通过引导模型从专家解决方案中重构而非直接模仿来促进知识吸收。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准测试中，组合应用这两种策略比标准Zero-RL基线分别提升了10%和16.6%的性能。

Conclusion: 这些人类启发的策略能显著提升大语言模型在复杂任务中的表现，展示了其在数学推理等领域的潜力。

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in areas like mathematical reasoning, large
language models still face significant challenges in consistently solving
complex problems. Drawing inspiration from key human learning strategies, we
propose two novel strategies to enhance the capability of large language models
to solve these complex problems. First, Adaptive Difficulty Curriculum Learning
(ADCL) is a novel curriculum learning strategy that tackles the Difficulty
Shift phenomenon (i.e., a model's perception of problem difficulty dynamically
changes during training) by periodically re-estimating difficulty within
upcoming data batches to maintain alignment with the model's evolving
capabilities. Second, Expert-Guided Self-Reformulation (EGSR) is a novel
reinforcement learning strategy that bridges the gap between imitation learning
and pure exploration by guiding models to reformulate expert solutions within
their own conceptual framework, rather than relying on direct imitation,
fostering deeper understanding and knowledge assimilation. Extensive
experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using Qwen2.5-7B
as the base model, demonstrate that these human-inspired strategies
synergistically and significantly enhance performance. Notably, their combined
application improves performance over the standard Zero-RL baseline by 10% on
the AIME24 benchmark and 16.6% on AIME25.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种后处理、模型无关的解决方案，为城市环境中自动驾驶车辆行为提供目的论解释，旨在提升社会信任与监管接受度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶的快速发展因AI决策不透明而面临社会信任与监管障碍，需提高其可解释性。

Method: 基于意图感知策略图（Intention-aware Policy Graphs），从全局和局部视角提取可解释的行为解释。

Result: 方法在nuScenes数据集上验证，能评估车辆行为是否符合法律界限并识别数据集与模型潜在漏洞。

Conclusion: 所提解释性方案有助于增强自动驾驶系统的透明度和可靠性，推动其社会与监管认可。

Abstract: The potential to improve road safety, reduce human driving error, and promote
environmental sustainability have enabled the field of autonomous driving to
progress rapidly over recent decades. The performance of autonomous vehicles
has significantly improved thanks to advancements in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly Deep Learning. Nevertheless, the opacity of their decision-making,
rooted in the use of accurate yet complex AI models, has created barriers to
their societal trust and regulatory acceptance, raising the need for
explainability. We propose a post-hoc, model-agnostic solution to provide
teleological explanations for the behaviour of an autonomous vehicle in urban
environments. Building on Intention-aware Policy Graphs, our approach enables
the extraction of interpretable and reliable explanations of vehicle behaviour
in the nuScenes dataset from global and local perspectives. We demonstrate the
potential of these explanations to assess whether the vehicle operates within
acceptable legal boundaries and to identify possible vulnerabilities in
autonomous driving datasets and models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Agent Network的服务导向范式AaaS-AN，通过动态Agent网络和服务导向agent，解决了多Agent系统中agent级协作的问题，并在数学推理和代码生成任务上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型AI agent的兴起引发了多Agent系统（MAS）的研究兴趣，但现有的Model Context Protocol（MCP）在agent级协作方面存在不足，因此需要提出新的解决方案。

Method: 论文提出了AaaS-AN，基于Role-Goal-Process-Service（RGPS）标准，通过动态Agent网络和服务导向agent（包括服务发现、注册和互操作协议）来统一agent的生命周期。

Result: AaaS-AN在数学推理和应用级代码生成任务上表现优于现有方法，并构建了一个包含100多个agent服务的MAS系统，同时发布了包含10,000个长视野多Agent工作流的数据集。

Conclusion: AaaS-AN通过动态Agent网络和服务导向agent的设计，显著提升了多Agent系统的协作效率和任务性能，为长链协作研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: The rise of large model-based AI agents has spurred interest in Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) for their capabilities in decision-making, collaboration, and
adaptability. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses tool invocation
and data exchange challenges via a unified protocol, it lacks support for
organizing agent-level collaboration. To bridge this gap, we propose
Agent-as-a-Service based on Agent Network (AaaS-AN), a service-oriented
paradigm grounded in the Role-Goal-Process-Service (RGPS) standard. AaaS-AN
unifies the entire agent lifecycle, including construction, integration,
interoperability, and networked collaboration, through two core components: (1)
a dynamic Agent Network, which models agents and agent groups as vertexes that
self-organize within the network based on task and role dependencies; (2)
service-oriented agents, incorporating service discovery, registration, and
interoperability protocols. These are orchestrated by a Service Scheduler,
which leverages an Execution Graph to enable distributed coordination, context
tracking, and runtime task management. We validate AaaS-AN on mathematical
reasoning and application-level code generation tasks, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, we constructed a MAS based on AaaS-AN
containing agent groups, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) workflows, and MCP
servers over 100 agent services. We also release a dataset containing 10,000
long-horizon multi-agent workflows to facilitate future research on long-chain
collaboration in MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于广义嵌套滚动策略适应（GNRPA）的新算法，用于解决柔性作业车间调度问题（FJSSP）。实验表明，该算法优于其他基于蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）的方法，但在大规模实例中与已知上限仍有差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性作业车间调度问题是一个NP难组合优化问题，在制造等领域有广泛应用。目标是高效调度多工序到不同机器上，属于典型的生产优化需求。

Method: 论文提出了一种改进的广义嵌套滚动策略适应（GNRPA）算法，针对FJSSP问题优化调度策略。

Result: 实验结果显示，该算法性能优于其他基于MCTS的方法，但在大规模实例中仍未能达到已知最优上限。

Conclusion: 改进的GNRPA算法在解决FJSSP问题上表现出潜力，但未来仍需进一步优化以缩小与理论上限的差距。

Abstract: The Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem, with several application domains, especially for
manufacturing purposes. The objective is to
  efficiently schedule multiple operations on dissimilar machines. These
operations are gathered into jobs, and operations pertaining to the same job
need to be scheduled sequentially. Different methods have been previously
tested to solve this problem, such as Constraint Solving, Tabu Search, Genetic
Algorithms, or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We propose a novel algorithm
derived from the Generalized Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation, developed to
solve the FJSSP. We report encouraging experimental results, as our algorithm
performs better than other MCTS-based approaches, even if makespans obtained on
large instances are still far from known upper bounds.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SAP的两阶段框架，通过策略评估网络（SEN）增强LLM在对抗领域中的对手建模能力，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对抗领域中有效建模和利用对手是一项长期挑战。尽管LLM在通用任务中表现出色，但在缺乏领域专业知识时直接生成决策存在局限。

Method: 采用两阶段SAP框架：离线阶段构建策略空间并训练SEN；在线阶段动态识别对手策略并通过SEN搜索最优响应，最终通过精心设计的提示将策略转化为行动。

Result: SAP展现出强大的泛化能力，在MicroRTS环境中性能提升85.35%，与基于规则的SOTA AI表现相当。

Conclusion: SAP框架显著提升了LLM在对手建模中的能力，为对抗性任务提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Efficiently modeling and exploiting opponents is a long-standing challenge in
adversarial domains. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive textual
data have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in general tasks,
introducing new research directions for opponent modeling. Some studies
primarily focus on directly using LLMs to generate decisions based on the
elaborate prompt context that incorporates opponent descriptions, while these
approaches are limited to scenarios where LLMs possess adequate domain
expertise. To address that, we introduce a two-stage Strategy-Augmented
Planning (SAP) framework that significantly enhances the opponent exploitation
capabilities of LLM-based agents by utilizing a critical component, the
Strategy Evaluation Network (SEN). Specifically, in the offline stage, we
construct an explicit strategy space and subsequently collect strategy-outcome
pair data for training the SEN network. During the online phase, SAP
dynamically recognizes the opponent's strategies and greedily exploits them by
searching best response strategy on the well-trained SEN, finally translating
strategy to a course of actions by carefully designed prompts. Experimental
results show that SAP exhibits robust generalization capabilities, allowing it
to perform effectively not only against previously encountered opponent
strategies but also against novel, unseen strategies. In the MicroRTS
environment, SAP achieves a 85.35\% performance improvement over baseline
methods and matches the competitiveness of reinforcement learning approaches
against state-of-the-art (SOTA) rule-based AI.

Abstract: The optimization of bidding strategies for online advertising slot auctions
presents a critical challenge across numerous digital marketplaces. A
significant obstacle to the development, evaluation, and refinement of
real-time autobidding algorithms is the scarcity of comprehensive datasets and
standardized benchmarks.
  To address this deficiency, we present an auction benchmark encompassing the
two most prevalent auction formats. We implement a series of robust baselines
on a novel dataset, addressing the most salient Real-Time Bidding (RTB) problem
domains: budget pacing uniformity and Cost Per Click (CPC) constraint
optimization. This benchmark provides a user-friendly and intuitive framework
for researchers and practitioners to develop and refine innovative autobidding
algorithms, thereby facilitating advancements in the field of programmatic
advertising. The implementation and additional resources can be accessed at the

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Gideon框架，通过本地小型LLM解决PDDL任务规划中的可扩展性和多域支持问题，实验显示在多域任务中规划有效性达70.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL符号任务规划在动态人机协作中存在可扩展性差、重规划需求高和规划延迟问题。现有神经符号框架依赖闭源远程LLM，存在第三方依赖、响应时间不稳定、规划长度和复杂性受限等问题。

Method: Gideon框架结合新型问题生成器，为任何领域生成大规模域-问题-规划元组数据集，并适配本地LLM实现设备端执行和多域支持。实验基于Qwen-2.5 1.5B模型，训练样本量8k-32k。

Result: 单域实验中32k模型规划有效率为66.1%；多域16k样本测试中规划有效率达70.6%，表明数据多样性可提升学习效率。模型体积仅为基线的1/120，推理效率和可扩展性显著优于大型LLM基线。

Conclusion: Gideon通过本地小型LLM实现了高效的多域任务规划，数据生成流水线可缓解训练效率问题，为人机协作中的规划问题提供了轻量化解决方案。

Abstract: PDDL-based symbolic task planning remains pivotal for robot autonomy yet
struggles with dynamic human-robot collaboration due to scalability,
re-planning demands, and delayed plan availability. Although a few
neurosymbolic frameworks have previously leveraged LLMs such as GPT-3 to
address these challenges, reliance on closed-source, remote models with limited
context introduced critical constraints: third-party dependency, inconsistent
response times, restricted plan length and complexity, and multi-domain
scalability issues. We present Gideon, a novel framework that enables the
transition to modern, smaller, local LLMs with extended context length. Gideon
integrates a novel problem generator to systematically generate large-scale
datasets of realistic domain-problem-plan tuples for any domain, and adapts
neurosymbolic planning for local LLMs, enabling on-device execution and
extended context for multi-domain support. Preliminary experiments in
single-domain scenarios performed on Qwen-2.5 1.5B and trained on 8k-32k
samples, demonstrate a valid plan percentage of 66.1% (32k model) and show that
the figure can be further scaled through additional data. Multi-domain tests on
16k samples yield an even higher 70.6% planning validity rate, proving
extensibility across domains and signaling that data variety can have a
positive effect on learning efficiency. Although long-horizon planning and
reduced model size make Gideon training much less efficient than baseline
models based on larger LLMs, the results are still significant considering that
the trained model is about 120x smaller than baseline and that significant
advantages can be achieved in inference efficiency, scalability, and
multi-domain adaptability, all critical factors in human-robot collaboration.
Training inefficiency can be mitigated by Gideon's streamlined data generation
pipeline.

retrieved within the top 20 recommendations. Evaluation across synthetic and
real clinical datasets confirmed state-of-the-art performance, with expert
assessment validating over 90 percent accuracy in criterion-level eligibility
classification, particularly excelling in biomarker-driven matches. Designed
for modularity and privacy, TrialMatchAI supports Phenopackets-standardized

Method: 通过理论分析，提出直观条件验证优先推理的System~P满足性，并扩展至团队语义和非团队语义的比较。

Result: 发现优先团队推理违反System~P，且直观条件的适用性存在语义差异；同时给出了两类表达式的复杂性结果。

Conclusion: 团队语义下的优先推理与经典优先推理在行为上存在显著差异，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper considers the complexity and properties of KLM-style preferential
reasoning in the setting of propositional logic with team semantics and
dependence atoms, also known as propositional dependence logic. Preferential
team-based reasoning is shown to be cumulative, yet violates System~P. We give
intuitive conditions that fully characterise those cases where preferential
propositional dependence logic satisfies System~P. We show that these
characterisations do, surprisingly, not carry over to preferential team-based
propositional logic. Furthermore, we show how classical entailment and
dependence logic entailment can be expressed in terms of non-trivial
preferential models. Finally, we present the complexity of preferential
team-based reasoning for two natural representations. This includes novel
complexity results for classical (non-team-based) preferential reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，FSM-SCG将智能合约代码的编译成功率最高提升48%，平均漏洞风险评分降低约68%。

Conclusion: FSM-SCG框架有效解决了智能合约生成的效率和安全问题，为自动化代码生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Smart contract is a kind of self-executing code based on blockchain
technology with a wide range of application scenarios, but the traditional
generation method relies on manual coding and expert auditing, which has a high
threshold and low efficiency. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show great
potential in programming tasks, they still face challenges in smart contract
generation w.r.t. effectiveness and security. To solve these problems, we
propose FSM-SCG, a smart contract generation framework based on finite state
machine (FSM) and LLMs, which significantly improves the quality of the
generated code by abstracting user requirements to generate FSM, guiding LLMs
to generate smart contracts, and iteratively optimizing the code with the
feedback of compilation and security checks. The experimental results show that
FSM-SCG significantly improves the quality of smart contract generation.
Compared to the best baseline, FSM-SCG improves the compilation success rate of
generated smart contract code by at most 48%, and reduces the average
vulnerability risk score by approximately 68%.

Motivation: 由于现有的提示反转方法（如软提示和硬提示技术）因可解释性有限和不连贯的提示生成而效果不佳，作者旨在解决文本提示创作过程中的挑战。

Result: 实验证明，VGD在生成可理解和上下文相关的提示方面优于现有技术，提升了与文本到图像模型的交互直观性和可控性。

Conclusion: VGD通过结合LLMs和CLIP评分，显著改善了提示生成的可解释性和灵活性，无需额外训练即可实现更优效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have
revolutionized visual content creation across various applications, including
advertising, personalized media, and design prototyping. However, crafting
effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often
requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such
as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited
interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we
propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages
large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and
semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text
generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by
employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts,
VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt
generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments
demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in
generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more
intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.

Motivation: 代谢综合征（MetS）全球患病率高且诊断常被低估，标准诊断需医疗机构血液检测。研究旨在利用日常生活中易获取的数据（如运动相关文本和生理指标）实现低成本早期诊断。

Method: 研究收集了40名志愿者的数据，采用数据增强解决不平衡问题，并提出了结合自然语言处理（NLP）和运动监测的深度学习框架。通过3折交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 最佳模型的AUC为0.806，召回率达76.3%。特征重要性分析显示，日常文本和最低心率对分类贡献最大。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用日常易测数据可实现MetS早期诊断，有望降低筛查和管理成本，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a medication condition characterized by
abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. It
increases the risk of majority of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and affects about one quarter of the global population. Therefore,
early detection and timely intervention for MetS are crucial. Standard
diagnosis for MetS components requires blood tests conducted within medical
institutions. However, it is frequently underestimated, leading to unmet need
for care for MetS population. This study aims to use the least physiological
data and free texts about exercises related activities, which are obtained
easily in daily life, to diagnosis MetS. We collected the data from 40
volunteers in a nursing home and used data augmentation to reduce the
imbalance. We propose a deep learning framework for classifying MetS that
integrates natural language processing (NLP) and exercise monitoring. The
results showed that the best model reported a high positive result (AUROC=0.806
and REC=76.3%) through 3-fold cross-validation. Feature importance analysis
revealed that text and minimum heart rate on a daily basis contribute the most
in the classification of MetS. This study demonstrates the potential
application of data that are easily measurable in daily life for the early
diagnosis of MetS, which could contribute to reducing the cost of screening and
management for MetS population.

Conclusion: 公开数据集和代码以推动代理工作流的可扩展评估研究，强调需要更强大的动态评估工具。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a
critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these
systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific
human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale
with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in
these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs
and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional
software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and
dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal
taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set
of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and
grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we
curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world
applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WixQA，一个基于Wix.com客户支持交互和知识库（KB）构建的问答（QA）基准套件，用于全面评估检索增强生成（RAG）系统在真实企业环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放领域数据集无法满足企业QA系统对具体、领域特定问题的需求，且缺乏包含知识库快照的端到端评估基准。

Method: 构建了三个不同的QA数据集：WixQA-ExpertWritten（真实用户查询与专家编写答案）、WixQA-Simulated（专家验证的模拟QA对）和WixQA-Synthetic（基于知识库文章生成的QA对）。同时发布了KB快照和基线结果。

Result: 推出了WixQA基准套件，包括数据集和KB快照，为评估企业RAG系统提供了全面支持。

Conclusion: WixQA填补了企业RAG评估的空白，提供了一个实用且可扩展的基准，适用于真实企业环境。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cornerstone of modern question
answering (QA) systems, enabling grounded answers based on external knowledge.
Although recent progress has been driven by open-domain datasets, enterprise QA
systems need datasets that mirror the concrete, domain-specific issues users
raise in day-to-day support scenarios. Critically, evaluating end-to-end RAG
systems requires benchmarks comprising not only question--answer pairs but also
the specific knowledge base (KB) snapshot from which answers were derived. To
address this need, we introduce WixQA, a benchmark suite featuring QA datasets
precisely grounded in the released KB corpus, enabling holistic evaluation of
retrieval and generation components. WixQA includes three distinct QA datasets
derived from Wix.com customer support interactions and grounded in a snapshot
of the public Wix Help Center KB: (i) WixQA-ExpertWritten, 200 real user
queries with expert-authored, multi-step answers; (ii) WixQA-Simulated, 200
expert-validated QA pairs distilled from user dialogues; and (iii)
WixQA-Synthetic, 6,222 LLM-generated QA pairs, with one pair systematically
derived from each article in the knowledge base. We release the KB snapshot
alongside the datasets under MIT license and provide comprehensive baseline
results, forming a unique benchmark for evaluating enterprise RAG systems in
realistic enterprise environments.

Abstract: This paper shows a comprehensive analysis of three algorithms (Time Series,
Random Forest (RF) and Deep Reinforcement Learning) into three inventory models
(the Lost Sales, Dual-Sourcing and Multi-Echelon Inventory Model). These
methodologies are applied in the supermarket context. The main purpose is to
analyse efficient methods for the data-driven. Their possibility, potential and
current challenges are taken into consideration in this report. By comparing
the results in each model, the effectiveness of each algorithm is evaluated
based on several key performance indicators, including forecast accuracy,
adaptability to market changes, and overall impact on inventory costs and
customer satisfaction levels. The data visualization tools and statistical
metrics are the indicators for the comparisons and show some obvious trends and
patterns that can guide decision-making in inventory management. These tools
enable managers to not only track the performance of different algorithms in
real-time but also to drill down into specific data points to understand the
underlying causes of inventory fluctuations. This level of detail is crucial
for pinpointing inefficiencies and areas for improvement within the supply
chain.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLM）在数学创造力方面仍有不足，DeepMath团队提出新评估标准并发布DeepMath-Creative基准，主流LLM在复杂问题上的表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学LLM主要关注推理能力，而创造力评估不足，缺乏相关数据集。DeepMath团队旨在填补这一空白，推动数学LLM的创造力发展。

Method: 提出数学创造力评估标准，构建DeepMath-Creative基准（涵盖代数、几何等领域的构造性问题），并系统评估主流LLM的创造力表现。

Result: 最佳模型O3 Mini在基础本科级任务中准确率仅70%，复杂问题表现更差，模型无法解决开放性问题，表明其创造力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的构造能力可能基于记忆模式重组，而非真正的创造性洞察，数学创造力仍需显著提升。

Abstract: To advance the mathematical proficiency of large language models (LLMs), the
DeepMath team has launched an open-source initiative aimed at developing an
open mathematical LLM and systematically evaluating its mathematical
creativity. This paper represents the initial contribution of this initiative.
While recent developments in mathematical LLMs have predominantly emphasized
reasoning skills, as evidenced by benchmarks on elementary to
undergraduate-level mathematical tasks, the creative capabilities of these
models have received comparatively little attention, and evaluation datasets
remain scarce. To address this gap, we propose an evaluation criteria for
mathematical creativity and introduce DeepMath-Creative, a novel, high-quality
benchmark comprising constructive problems across algebra, geometry, analysis,
and other domains. We conduct a systematic evaluation of mainstream LLMs'
creative problem-solving abilities using this dataset. Experimental results
show that even under lenient scoring criteria -- emphasizing core solution
components and disregarding minor inaccuracies, such as small logical gaps,
incomplete justifications, or redundant explanations -- the best-performing
model, O3 Mini, achieves merely 70% accuracy, primarily on basic
undergraduate-level constructive tasks. Performance declines sharply on more
complex problems, with models failing to provide substantive strategies for
open problems. These findings suggest that, although current LLMs display a
degree of constructive proficiency on familiar and lower-difficulty problems,
such performance is likely attributable to the recombination of memorized
patterns rather than authentic creative insight or novel synthesis.

Motivation: ARC-AGI是人工通用智能（AGI）的核心挑战，当前AI系统难以应对，但人类却能轻松解决。本文旨在通过开发性方法提升AI的问题解决能力。

Method: 采用标准神经细胞自动机（NCA）及增强版隐藏记忆NCA（EngramNCA），模拟生物系统中的复杂动态和涌现模式。

Result: ARC-NCA在少数示例下展现出与ChatGPT 4.5相当甚至更优的性能，且成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 通过整合开发性原则，ARC-NCA为AI超越训练数据外推提供了新思路，展示了自适应推理的潜力。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.

Motivation: 标准A/B测试在大规模工业应用中通常基于t检验，但由于小样本、非高斯分布或ROI考虑，统计功效较低。

Method: 提出了回归调整、广义估计方程、Man-Whitney U和Zero-Trimmed U等方法，以及一种新型双重鲁棒广义U框架。

Result: 提供了渐近正态性和效率界限的理论结果，并通过模拟研究和实际A/B测试验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了统计功效，适用于多种复杂商业场景。

Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale
industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low
statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or
non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this
paper, we propose several approaches to addresses these challenges: (i)
regression adjustment, generalized estimating equation, Man-Whitney U and
Zero-Trimmed U that addresses each of these issues separately, and (ii) a novel
doubly robust generalized U that handles ROI consideration, distribution
robustness and small samples in one framework. We provide theoretical results
on asymptotic normality and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the
efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive
simulation studies and apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests.

Motivation: 解决传统太赫兹单像素成像技术因长波长限制的分辨率问题，以及苛刻的实验条件和耗时过程。

Result: 实现了亚衍射成像，空间分辨率达λ0/7，压缩比低至1.5625%，且无需超薄光调制器。

Conclusion: 该技术为太赫兹显微成像和其他逆成像问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Terahertz single-pixel imaging (TSPI) has garnered significant attention due
to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, the relatively long
wavelength of THz waves limits sub-diffraction-scale imaging resolution.
Although TSPI technique can achieve sub-wavelength resolution, it requires
harsh experimental conditions and time-consuming processes. Here, we propose a
sub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We
illuminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The
transmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back
surface of a 500-{\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited
carriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a
single-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively
reconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625%
under a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To
further suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular
spectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during
propagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object,
enabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\lambda}0/7
({\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin
photomodulators. This approach provides an efficient solution for advancing THz
microscopic imaging and addressing other inverse imaging challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICE导管导航依赖易受干扰的电磁跟踪或手动调整，需设计无外部传感器的自动定位方法。

Method: 使用ViT模型处理ICE图像，通过16x16分块嵌入和独立线性层预测位置与方向，基于851例临床数据训练。

Conclusion: AI系统可独立或结合现有技术实现无跟踪导管定位，降低操作负担，推动ICE引导手术变革。

Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a crucial role in
Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by
providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of cardiac structures. However,
existing navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is
susceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments
based on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
anatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position
and orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external
tracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep
learning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and
anatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of
851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels
normalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16
embeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token
independently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers. The
model is optimized using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, balancing
positional and orientational accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate an
average positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98
deg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy.
Qualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target
views within 3D cardiac meshes. This AI-driven system enhances procedural
efficiency, reduces operator workload, and enables real-time ICE catheter
localization for tracking-free procedures. The proposed method can function
independently or complement existing mapping systems like CARTO, offering a
transformative approach to ICE-guided interventions.

Abstract: The diffusion model has recently emerged as a potent approach in computer
vision, demonstrating remarkable performances in the field of generative
artificial intelligence. Capable of producing high-quality synthetic images,
diffusion models have been successfully applied across a range of applications.
However, a significant challenge remains with the high computational cost
associated with training and generating these models. This study focuses on the
efficiency and inference time of diffusion-based generative models,
highlighting their applications in both natural and medical imaging. We present
the most recent advances in diffusion models by categorizing them into three
key models: the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), the Latent
Diffusion Model (LDM), and the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM). These models play
a crucial role in medical imaging, where producing fast, reliable, and
high-quality medical images is essential for accurate analysis of abnormalities
and disease diagnosis. We first investigate the general framework of DDPM, LDM,
and WDM and discuss the computational complexity gap filled by these models in
natural and medical imaging. We then discuss the current limitations of these
models as well as the opportunities and future research directions in medical
imaging.

Abstract: Keratoconus (KC) is a progressive corneal disorder characterized by localized
thinning and protrusion, leading to visual distortion. While Placido disc-based
topography remains a standard in clinical diagnostics, its dependence on
specialized equipment limits accessibility. In this paper, we propose a
portable, smartphone-based diagnostic framework that captures corneal
reflections of a Placido disc displayed on a phone screen and applies a
two-stage detection pipeline, then validate on 3D-printed emulated eyeball
models that simulate normal, moderate, and severe KC stages based on anterior
chamber depth (ACD). The first step of the two-stage detection pipeline is
classifying different stages of KC with features including height and width of
extracted reflections using weighted support vector machine (WSVM). It achieves
a maximum accuracy of 92.93%, and maintains over 90% accuracy across multiple
smartphone models, including the Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16
Pro. For the second step, we visualize the KC-affected protrusion regions on
the corneas with color maps based on inter-disc distance, that provides an
intuitive representation of disease severity and localization. Moreover, we
validate the ability of the extracted features to differentiate between KC
stages with ANOVA and Omega Squared, with significant p-values (e.g., $p <
10^{-6}$) and large effect sizes ($\\omega^2$ up to 0.8398) among classes.

Abstract: Semantic anomalies are contextually invalid or unusual combinations of
familiar visual elements that can cause undefined behavior and failures in
system-level reasoning for autonomous systems. This work explores semantic
anomaly detection by leveraging the semantic priors of state-of-the-art vision
foundation models, operating directly on the image. We propose a framework that
compares local vision embeddings from runtime images to a database of nominal
scenarios in which the autonomous system is deemed safe and performant. In this
work, we consider two variants of the proposed framework: one using raw
grid-based embeddings, and another leveraging instance segmentation for
object-centric representations. To further improve robustness, we introduce a
simple filtering mechanism to suppress false positives. Our evaluations on
CARLA-simulated anomalies show that the instance-based method with filtering
achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, while providing precise anomaly
localization. These results highlight the potential utility of vision
embeddings from foundation models for real-time anomaly detection in autonomous
systems.

Conclusion: JSover为单能CT多材料分解提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案，扩大了临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Multi-material decomposition (MMD) enables quantitative reconstruction of
tissue compositions in the human body, supporting a wide range of clinical
applications. However, traditional MMD typically requires spectral CT scanners
and pre-measured X-ray energy spectra, significantly limiting clinical
applicability. To this end, various methods have been developed to perform MMD
using conventional (i.e., single-energy, SE) CT systems, commonly referred to
as SEMMD. Despite promising progress, most SEMMD methods follow a two-step
image decomposition pipeline, which first reconstructs monochromatic CT images
using algorithms such as FBP, and then performs decomposition on these images.
The initial reconstruction step, however, neglects the energy-dependent
attenuation of human tissues, introducing severe nonlinear beam hardening
artifacts and noise into the subsequent decomposition. This paper proposes
JSover, a fundamentally reformulated one-step SEMMD framework that jointly
reconstructs multi-material compositions and estimates the energy spectrum
directly from SECT projections. By explicitly incorporating physics-informed
spectral priors into the SEMMD process, JSover accurately simulates a virtual
spectral CT system from SE acquisitions, thereby improving the reliability and
accuracy of decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce implicit neural
representation (INR) as an unsupervised deep learning solver for representing
the underlying material maps. The inductive bias of INR toward continuous image
patterns constrains the solution space and further enhances estimation quality.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and real CT datasets show that JSover
outperforms state-of-the-art SEMMD methods in accuracy and computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 大规模机器人应用（如搜救、智慧城市、采矿）需要快速且可扩展的场景编码，但部署在有限计算资源的机器人上是挑战。

Method: 集成SAM和CLIP的2D视觉语言特征到3D场景，通过归一化加权平均从高斯参数提取语言嵌入，引入向量数据库优化存储与检索。

Result: 在16-GPU设置下比OpenGaussian快18倍，ScanNet和LERF数据集上保持嵌入质量。

Conclusion: SLAG高效解决语言增强场景表示的实时性与扩展性问题，适合资源受限的机器人部署。

Abstract: Language-augmented scene representations hold great promise for large-scale
robotics applications such as search-and-rescue, smart cities, and mining. Many
of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while
also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these
representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to
the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for
language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability
of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model
features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG
eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language
embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters
via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding.
Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage
and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in
embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while
preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets. For more

However, deploying high-performance models like Point Transformer V3 in
resource-constrained environments remains challenging due to their high
computational and memory demands. This work introduces a novel distillation
framework that leverages topology-aware representations and gradient-guided
knowledge distillation to effectively transfer knowledge from a high-capacity
teacher to a lightweight student model. Our approach captures the underlying
geometric structures of point clouds while selectively guiding the student
model's learning process through gradient-based feature alignment. Experimental
results in the Nuscenes, SemanticKITTI, and Waymo datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves competitive performance, with an approximately 16x
reduction in model size and a nearly 1.9x decrease in inference time compared
to its teacher model. Notably, on NuScenes, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among knowledge distillation techniques trained
solely on LiDAR data, surpassing prior knowledge distillation baselines in
segmentation performance. Our implementation is available publicly at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于扩散模型的图像修复方法，用于单张图像中的雨滴去除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雨滴去除是图像处理中的一项挑战性任务，尤其是在仅依赖单张图像的情况下，现有方法通常依赖GAN进行背景修复。

Method: 采用了基于扩散模型的图像修复技术，作为单张图像雨滴去除的新方法。

Result: 通过扩散模型，实现了高效的雨滴去除效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在单张图像雨滴去除任务上表现出色，提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: Raindrop removal is a challenging task in image processing. Removing
raindrops while relying solely on a single image further increases the
difficulty of the task. Common approaches include the detection of raindrop
regions in the image, followed by performing a background restoration process
conditioned on those regions. While various methods can be applied for the
detection step, the most common architecture used for background restoration is
the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Recent advances in the use of
diffusion models have led to state-of-the-art image inpainting techniques. In
this paper, we introduce a novel technique for raindrop removal from a single
image using diffusion-based image inpainting.

Method: 提出了GVN框架及其高效版本E-GVN，将视觉感知能力整合到MPNNs中。

Result: 实验表明，GVN在七个链接预测数据集（包括大规模图）上均受益于视觉增强，且与现有SOTA方法兼容，达到了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: GVN展示了视觉感知在链接预测中的潜力，为这一领域开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) and structural features (SFs)
are cornerstones for the link prediction task. However, as a common and
intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been
overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with
vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph
Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive
empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN
consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction
datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are
compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new
SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link
prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统艺术研究依赖主观判断，机器学习可定量揭示人眼难发现的特征，尤其是东方绘画缺乏全面分析。

Method: 基于11,000张高清浮世绘图像，利用网络计算模型量化艺术创造力。

Result: 浮世绘整体创造力随文化成熟下降，但风格细分保持高创新性，为东方艺术分析提供新视角。

Conclusion: 研究不仅深化了浮世绘理解，还展示了其在文化史中的演变，对东方艺术分析具有重要文化意义。

Abstract: Artwork research has long relied on human sensibility and subjective
judgment, but recent developments in machine learning have enabled the
quantitative assessment of features that humans could not discover. In Western
paintings, comprehensive analyses have been conducted from various perspectives
in conjunction with large databases, but such extensive analysis has not been
sufficiently conducted for Eastern paintings. Then, we focus on Ukiyo-e, a
traditional Japanese art form, as a case study of Eastern paintings, and
conduct a quantitative analysis of creativity in works of art using 11,000
high-resolution images. This involves using the concept of calculating
creativity from networks to analyze both the creativity of the artwork and that
of the artists. As a result, In terms of Ukiyo-e as a whole, it was found that
the creativity of its appearance has declined with the maturation of culture,
but in terms of style, it has become more segmented with the maturation of
culture and has maintained a high level of creativity. This not only provides
new insights into the study of Ukiyo-e but also shows how Ukiyo-e has evolved
within the ongoing cultural history, playing a culturally significant role in
the analysis of Eastern art.

### [189] [Removing Watermarks with Partial Regeneration using Semantic Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08234)
*Krti Tallam,John Kevin Cava,Caleb Geniesse,N. Benjamin Erichson,Michael W. Mahoney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了一种名为SemanticRegen的新型攻击方法，能有效擦除最先进的语义和隐形水印，同时保持图像的表观意义。通过三阶段的标签无关攻击流程，该攻击在四种水印系统上表现优于现有方法，并引入了新的评估指标mSSIM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的普及，隐形水印成为版权保护的主要手段。然而，现有的语义水印对适应性攻击的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。本文旨在揭示当前水印方法的脆弱性，并提出一种更有效的攻击方法。

Method: 提出SemanticRegen攻击方法，包含三个阶段：(i)使用视觉-语言模型获取细粒度描述，(ii)通过零样本分割提取前景掩模，(iii)利用LLM引导的扩散模型仅修复背景，保留显著对象和风格。

Result: 在四种水印系统（TreeRing、StegaStamp、StableSig、DWT/DCT）上测试，SemanticRegen首次成功击败语义TreeRing水印，并将其他方案的比特准确率降至0.75以下，同时保持高感知质量（mSSIM=0.94）。

Conclusion: 研究表明当前水印防御与适应性攻击能力之间存在显著差距，亟需开发能抵抗内容保留再生攻击的鲁棒水印算法。

Abstract: As AI-generated imagery becomes ubiquitous, invisible watermarks have emerged
as a primary line of defense for copyright and provenance. The newest
watermarking schemes embed semantic signals - content-aware patterns that are
designed to survive common image manipulations - yet their true robustness
against adaptive adversaries remains under-explored. We expose a previously
unreported vulnerability and introduce SemanticRegen, a three-stage, label-free
attack that erases state-of-the-art semantic and invisible watermarks while
leaving an image's apparent meaning intact. Our pipeline (i) uses a
vision-language model to obtain fine-grained captions, (ii) extracts foreground
masks with zero-shot segmentation, and (iii) inpaints only the background via
an LLM-guided diffusion model, thereby preserving salient objects and style
cues. Evaluated on 1,000 prompts across four watermarking systems - TreeRing,
StegaStamp, StableSig, and DWT/DCT - SemanticRegen is the only method to defeat
the semantic TreeRing watermark (p = 0.10 > 0.05) and reduces bit-accuracy
below 0.75 for the remaining schemes, all while maintaining high perceptual
quality (masked SSIM = 0.94 +/- 0.01). We further introduce masked SSIM (mSSIM)
to quantify fidelity within foreground regions, showing that our attack
achieves up to 12 percent higher mSSIM than prior diffusion-based attackers.
These results highlight an urgent gap between current watermark defenses and
the capabilities of adaptive, semantics-aware adversaries, underscoring the
need for watermarking algorithms that are resilient to content-preserving
regenerative attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统吸入性损伤诊断方法（如AIS）依赖主观评估且与临床结果相关性弱，需要更客观准确的分级方法。

Method: 引入改良的StarGAN（结合Patch Loss和SSIM Loss）生成高质量合成支气管镜图像，并用Swin Transformer进行分类评估。

Result: 改良StarGAN生成的图像在FID得分（30.06）和分类准确率（77.78%，提升11.11%）上优于基线模型，且临床专家认可其真实性和结构保留。

Conclusion: 改良StarGAN能有效解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，提升吸入性损伤分级的准确性和临床实用性。

Abstract: Inhalation injuries face a challenge in clinical diagnosis and grading due to
the limitations of traditional methods, such as Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS),
which rely on subjective assessments and show weak correlations with clinical
outcomes. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based framework for
grading inhalation injuries using bronchoscopy images with the duration of
mechanical ventilation as an objective metric. To address the scarcity of
medical imaging data, we propose enhanced StarGAN, a generative model that
integrates Patch Loss and SSIM Loss to improve synthetic images' quality and
clinical relevance. The augmented dataset generated by enhanced StarGAN
significantly improved classification performance when evaluated using the Swin
Transformer, achieving an accuracy of 77.78%, an 11.11% improvement over the
original dataset. Image quality was assessed using the Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (FID), where Enhanced StarGAN achieved the lowest FID of 30.06,
outperforming baseline models. Burn surgeons confirmed the realism and clinical
relevance of the generated images, particularly the preservation of bronchial
structures and color distribution. These results highlight the potential of
enhanced StarGAN in addressing data limitations and improving classification
accuracy for inhalation injury grading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC系统基于固定时间表运行，未考虑占用情况。RGB图像占用检测引发隐私问题，而低分辨率热成像提供了非侵入式解决方案。

Method: 研究采用低分辨率热成像和CV技术，通过迁移学习微调YOLOv5模型，开发占用检测模型。

Result: 模型性能出色，精确度、召回率、mAP50等指标接近1.000，同时减少隐私问题和计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅缓解了隐私问题，还降低了计算需求，为HVAC系统的占用检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Occupancy plays an essential role in influencing the energy consumption and
operation of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.
Traditional HVAC typically operate on fixed schedules without considering
occupancy. Advanced occupant-centric control (OCC) adopted occupancy status in
regulating HVAC operations. RGB images combined with computer vision (CV)
techniques are widely used for occupancy detection, however, the detailed
facial and body features they capture raise significant privacy concerns.
Low-resolution thermal images offer a non-invasive solution that mitigates
privacy issues. The study developed an occupancy detection model utilizing
low-resolution thermal images and CV techniques, where transfer learning was
applied to fine-tune the You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) model. The
developed model ultimately achieved satisfactory performance, with precision,
recall, mAP50, and mAP50 values approaching 1.000. The contributions of this
model lie not only in mitigating privacy concerns but also in reducing
computing resource demands.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具的普及，视觉艺术作品的版权侵权和伪造问题日益严重。现有的生成模型容易记忆训练数据，可能导致不同程度的版权侵犯。因此，需要一种有效的方法来检测此类侵权行为。

Method: 基于DeepfakeArt Challenge基准，作者提出了DFA-CON框架，通过对比学习学习判别性表示空间，并在多种攻击类型（如修复、风格迁移、对抗扰动和cutmix）上进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，DFA-CON在大多数攻击类型上表现出鲁棒的检测性能，优于现有的预训练基础模型。

Conclusion: DFA-CON为解决AI生成艺术作品的版权侵权和伪造问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，其性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent proliferation of generative AI tools for visual content
creation-particularly in the context of visual artworks-has raised serious
concerns about copyright infringement and forgery. The large-scale datasets
used to train these models often contain a mixture of copyrighted and
non-copyrighted artworks. Given the tendency of generative models to memorize
training patterns, they are susceptible to varying degrees of copyright
violation. Building on the recently proposed DeepfakeArt Challenge benchmark,
this work introduces DFA-CON, a contrastive learning framework designed to
detect copyright-infringing or forged AI-generated art. DFA-CON learns a
discriminative representation space, posing affinity among original artworks
and their forged counterparts within a contrastive learning framework. The
model is trained across multiple attack types, including inpainting, style
transfer, adversarial perturbation, and cutmix. Evaluation results demonstrate
robust detection performance across most attack types, outperforming recent
pretrained foundation models. Code and model checkpoints will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Elevation Semantic Segmentation Image (MESSI)
dataset comprising 2525 images taken by a drone flying over dense urban
environments. MESSI is unique in two main features. First, it contains images
from various altitudes, allowing us to investigate the effect of depth on
semantic segmentation. Second, it includes images taken from several different
urban regions (at different altitudes). This is important since the variety
covers the visual richness captured by a drone's 3D flight, performing
horizontal and vertical maneuvers. MESSI contains images annotated with
location, orientation, and the camera's intrinsic parameters and can be used to
train a deep neural network for semantic segmentation or other applications of
interest (e.g., localization, navigation, and tracking). This paper describes
the dataset and provides annotation details. It also explains how semantic
segmentation was performed using several neural network models and shows
several relevant statistics. MESSI will be published in the public domain to
serve as an evaluation benchmark for semantic segmentation using images
captured by a drone or similar vehicle flying over a dense urban environment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FAD的频率感知框架，通过频谱域分析和分频带适配，显著提升了跨域小样本学习的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注空间域而忽略了频谱域的变化，导致在分布偏移场景下泛化能力受限。FAD通过频谱分析和分频带适配解决了这一问题。

Method: FAD采用Fourier变换将特征转换为频谱域，分解为低频、中频和高频子带，并为每个频带设计独立的卷积适配分支。

Result: 在Meta-Dataset基准测试中，FAD在已知和未知域上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 频谱域表征和分频带适配可有效提升跨域小样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) requires models to generalize from
limited labeled samples under significant distribution shifts. While recent
methods enhance adaptability through lightweight task-specific modules, they
operate solely in the spatial domain and overlook frequency-specific variations
that are often critical for robust transfer. We observe that spatially similar
images across domains can differ substantially in their spectral
representations, with low and high frequencies capturing complementary semantic
information at coarse and fine levels. This indicates that uniform spatial
adaptation may overlook these spectral distinctions, thus constraining
generalization. To address this, we introduce Frequency Adaptation and
Diversion (FAD), a frequency-aware framework that explicitly models and
modulates spectral components. At its core is the Frequency Diversion Adapter,
which transforms intermediate features into the frequency domain using the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT), partitions them into low, mid, and
high-frequency bands via radial masks, and reconstructs each band using inverse
DFT (IDFT). Each frequency band is then adapted using a dedicated convolutional
branch with a kernel size tailored to its spectral scale, enabling targeted and
disentangled adaptation across frequencies. Extensive experiments on the
Meta-Dataset benchmark demonstrate that FAD consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both seen and unseen domains, validating the
utility of frequency-domain representations and band-wise adaptation for
improving generalization in CD-FSL.

Conclusion: StoryAnchors为故事驱动的帧生成提供了可扩展、灵活且高度可编辑的基础，推动了该领域的边界。

Abstract: This paper introduces StoryAnchors, a unified framework for generating
high-quality, multi-scene story frames with strong temporal consistency. The
framework employs a bidirectional story generator that integrates both past and
future contexts to ensure temporal consistency, character continuity, and
smooth scene transitions throughout the narrative. Specific conditions are
introduced to distinguish story frame generation from standard video synthesis,
facilitating greater scene diversity and enhancing narrative richness. To
further improve generation quality, StoryAnchors integrates Multi-Event Story
Frame Labeling and Progressive Story Frame Training, enabling the model to
capture both overarching narrative flow and event-level dynamics. This approach
supports the creation of editable and expandable story frames, allowing for
manual modifications and the generation of longer, more complex sequences.
Extensive experiments show that StoryAnchors outperforms existing open-source
models in key areas such as consistency, narrative coherence, and scene
diversity. Its performance in narrative consistency and story richness is also
on par with GPT-4o. Ultimately, StoryAnchors pushes the boundaries of
story-driven frame generation, offering a scalable, flexible, and highly
editable foundation for future research.

Abstract: Event cameras have emerged as promising sensors for 3D reconstruction due to
their ability to capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously. Unlike
conventional frame-based cameras, they produce sparse and temporally rich data
streams, which enable more accurate 3D reconstruction and open up the
possibility of performing reconstruction in extreme environments such as
high-speed motion, low light, or high dynamic range scenes. In this survey, we
provide the first comprehensive review focused exclusively on 3D reconstruction
using event cameras. The survey categorises existing works into three major
types based on input modality - stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and
further classifies them by reconstruction approach, including geometry-based,
deep learning-based, and recent neural rendering techniques such as Neural
Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Methods with a similar research
focus were organised chronologically into the most subdivided groups. We also
summarise public datasets relevant to event-based 3D reconstruction. Finally,
we highlight current research limitations in data availability, evaluation,
representation, and dynamic scene handling, and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference and
a roadmap for future developments in event-driven 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Recently, the application of deep learning in image colorization has received
widespread attention. The maturation of diffusion models has further advanced
the development of image colorization models. However, current mainstream image
colorization models still face issues such as color bleeding and color binding
errors, and cannot colorize images at the instance level. In this paper, we
propose a diffusion-based colorization method MT-Color to achieve precise
instance-aware colorization with use-provided guidance. To tackle color
bleeding issue, we design a pixel-level mask attention mechanism that
integrates latent features and conditional gray image features through
cross-attention. We use segmentation masks to construct cross-attention masks,
preventing pixel information from exchanging between different instances. We
also introduce an instance mask and text guidance module that extracts instance
masks and text representations of each instance, which are then fused with
latent features through self-attention, utilizing instance masks to form
self-attention masks to prevent instance texts from guiding the colorization of
other areas, thus mitigating color binding errors. Furthermore, we apply a
multi-instance sampling strategy, which involves sampling each instance region
separately and then fusing the results. Additionally, we have created a
specialized dataset for instance-level colorization tasks, GPT-color, by
leveraging large visual language models on existing image datasets. Qualitative
and quantitative experiments show that our model and dataset outperform
previous methods and datasets.

Motivation: 营养估计对健康饮食和降低饮食相关健康风险很重要，但缺乏带营养标注的数据集限制了进展。因此，作者提出了FastFood数据集和相关方法。

Method: 提出了VIF$^2$方法，通过视觉-食材特征融合提升营养估计。包括食材鲁棒性增强、特征融合模块，并使用多模态模型优化测试阶段的食材预测。

Result: 在FastFood和Nutrition5k数据集上的实验表明，该方法在不同骨干网络（如Resnet、InceptionV3和ViT）中均有效，证明了食材信息对营养估计的重要性。

Abstract: Nutrition estimation is an important component of promoting healthy eating
and mitigating diet-related health risks. Despite advances in tasks such as
food classification and ingredient recognition, progress in nutrition
estimation is limited due to the lack of datasets with nutritional annotations.
To address this issue, we introduce FastFood, a dataset with 84,446 images
across 908 fast food categories, featuring ingredient and nutritional
annotations. In addition, we propose a new model-agnostic Visual-Ingredient
Feature Fusion (VIF$^2$) method to enhance nutrition estimation by integrating
visual and ingredient features. Ingredient robustness is improved through
synonym replacement and resampling strategies during training. The
ingredient-aware visual feature fusion module combines ingredient features and
visual representation to achieve accurate nutritional prediction. During
testing, ingredient predictions are refined using large multimodal models by
data augmentation and majority voting. Our experiments on both FastFood and
Nutrition5k datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method built in
different backbones (e.g., Resnet, InceptionV3 and ViT), which demonstrates the
importance of ingredient information in nutrition estimation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CityAVOS数据集和PRPSearcher方法，用于无人机在复杂城市环境中自主搜索目标物体，并展示了其优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机在城市环境中自主搜索目标物体时面临的语义冗余、相似物体区分和探索-利用困境等问题。

Method: 提出了PRPSearcher方法，利用多模态大语言模型构建三种专用地图（动态语义地图、3D认知地图和不确定性地图），并结合去噪机制和IPT提示机制。

Result: PRPSearcher在成功率和搜索效率上显著优于现有基线方法（平均提高37.69% SR和28.96% SPL，降低30.69% MSS和46.40% NE）。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来的目标搜索研究奠定了基础，但性能与人类相比仍有差距，需进一步改进语义推理和空间探索能力。

Abstract: Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target
objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing
approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic
processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation
dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS,
the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This
dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying
difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search
capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher
(Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier
cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an
object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D
cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a
3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our
approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from
similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting
mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS
demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate
and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and
-46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights
the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in
AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied
target search. Dataset and source code are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多模态检索增强生成（RAG）系统，通过从粗到细的多步检索协调多模态和多粒度信息，显著提升了知识库视觉问答（KB-VQA）的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在多模态检索中未能充分利用查询和知识库中多模态和多粒度信息的潜在交互，限制了KB-VQA系统的效能。

Method: 系统采用从粗到细的多步检索：首先进行粗粒度对齐的跨模态检索，然后通过多模态融合重新排序捕捉细粒度信息，最后用文本重新排序筛选最相关的片段用于生成。

Result: 在InfoSeek和Encyclopedic-VQA基准测试中，该方法实现了最先进的检索性能和极具竞争力的回答效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过协调多模态和多粒度信息，有效提升了KB-VQA系统的表现，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an effective
approach for tackling Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), which
requires external knowledge beyond the visual content presented in images. The
effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval,
which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge
granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not
fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a
multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that
harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our
system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for
cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the
nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then
filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation.
Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our
method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive
answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.

Motivation: 生物医学问答系统需要高效且准确的检索和生成组件，但现有方法在检索深度、效率和可扩展性上的权衡尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究评估了BM25、BioBERT、MedCPT及混合检索方法，比较了不同数据存储工具在PubMed子集和完整数据集上的表现。

Result: 使用BM25检索50篇文档后用MedCPT重排，系统在准确率（0.90）、召回率（0.90）和响应时间（1.91秒）上达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了生物医学QA中检索深度与效率的权衡，并为开源系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Biomedical question-answering (QA) systems require effective retrieval and
generation components to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. This
study systematically examines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for
biomedical QA, evaluating retrieval strategies and response time trade-offs. We
first assess state-of-the-art retrieval methods, including BM25, BioBERT,
MedCPT, and a hybrid approach, alongside common data stores such as
Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and FAISS, on a ~10% subset of PubMed (2.4M documents)
to measure indexing efficiency, retrieval latency, and retriever performance in
the end-to-end RAG system. Based on these insights, we deploy the final RAG
system on the full 24M PubMed corpus, comparing different retrievers' impact on
overall performance. Evaluations of the retrieval depth show that retrieving 50
documents with BM25 before reranking with MedCPT optimally balances accuracy
(0.90), recall (0.90), and response time (1.91s). BM25 retrieval time remains
stable (82ms), while MedCPT incurs the main computational cost. These results
highlight previously not well-known trade-offs in retrieval depth, efficiency,
and scalability for biomedical QA. With open-source code, the system is fully
reproducible and extensible.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于双曲对比学习和模型增强的知识感知推荐方法，通过Lorentzian知识聚合机制和模型级增强技术，有效捕捉用户-物品二分图和知识图谱的层次结构，避免了传统结构增强导致的学习偏好偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于对比学习的GNN方法难以有效捕捉用户-物品二分图和知识图谱的层次结构，且传统的图结构扰动生成正样本可能导致用户偏好学习偏移。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了双曲对比学习与模型增强相结合的方法。

Method: 首先设计了一种新颖的Lorentzian知识聚合机制，以更有效地表示用户和物品；然后提出了三种模型级增强技术来辅助双曲对比学习，避免了传统结构增强（如边丢弃）可能导致的偏好偏移。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提方法的优越性，相较于现有基线方法，改进幅度最高达11.03%。

Conclusion: 论文提出的双曲对比学习与模型增强方法在知识感知推荐中表现优异，能够更好地捕捉层次结构并避免偏好偏移，为相关领域提供了新的技术思路。

Abstract: Benefiting from the effectiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs) and
contrastive learning, GNN-based contrastive learning has become mainstream for
knowledge-aware recommendation. However, most existing contrastive
learning-based methods have difficulties in effectively capturing the
underlying hierarchical structure within user-item bipartite graphs and
knowledge graphs. Moreover, they commonly generate positive samples for
contrastive learning by perturbing the graph structure, which may lead to a
shift in user preference learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose
hyperbolic contrastive learning with model-augmentation for knowledge-aware
recommendation. To capture the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures, we
first design a novel Lorentzian knowledge aggregation mechanism, which enables
more effective representations of users and items. Then, we propose three
model-level augmentation techniques to assist Hyperbolic contrastive learning.
Different from the classical structure-level augmentation (e.g., edge
dropping), the proposed model-augmentations can avoid preference shifts between
the augmented positive pair. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the superiority (maximum improvement of $11.03\%$) of proposed
methods over existing baselines.

*Kuan-Cheng Chen,Chen-Yu Liu,Yu Shang,Felix Burt,Kin K. Leung*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种分布式量子-经典框架，结合光子量子神经网络(QNN)和矩阵乘积态(MPS)，实现了参数高效的经典神经网络训练。该方法在MNIST分类任务中表现优异，展示了量子计算的实用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是利用量子计算的优势（如高维表达和并行性）来优化经典神经网络的参数效率，同时解决量子硬件在实际部署中的限制。

Method: 方法是通过光子QNN生成高维概率分布，再通过MPS映射为经典网络权重，形成混合量子-经典工作流。实验验证了噪声鲁棒性和量子必要性。

Result: 结果在MNIST分类中达到95.50%准确率（参数减少50%），量子压缩比经典方法高6-12%。噪声实验表明框架对硬件缺陷鲁棒。

Conclusion: 结论是这种框架为分布式量子机器学习提供了实用路径，结合了光子希尔伯特空间的表达能力和经典神经网络的可部署性。

Abstract: We introduce a distributed quantum-classical framework that synergizes
photonic quantum neural networks (QNNs) with matrix-product-state (MPS) mapping
to achieve parameter-efficient training of classical neural networks. By
leveraging universal linear-optical decompositions of $M$-mode interferometers
and photon-counting measurement statistics, our architecture generates neural
parameters through a hybrid quantum-classical workflow: photonic QNNs with
$M(M+1)/2$ trainable parameters produce high-dimensional probability
distributions that are mapped to classical network weights via an MPS model
with bond dimension $\chi$. Empirical validation on MNIST classification
demonstrates that photonic QT achieves an accuracy of $95.50\% \pm 0.84\%$
using 3,292 parameters ($\chi = 10$), compared to $96.89\% \pm 0.31\%$ for
classical baselines with 6,690 parameters. Moreover, a ten-fold compression
ratio is achieved at $\chi = 4$, with a relative accuracy loss of less than
$3\%$. The framework outperforms classical compression techniques (weight
sharing/pruning) by 6--12\% absolute accuracy while eliminating quantum
hardware requirements during inference through classical deployment of
compressed parameters. Simulations incorporating realistic photonic noise
demonstrate the framework's robustness to near-term hardware imperfections.
Ablation studies confirm quantum necessity: replacing photonic QNNs with random
inputs collapses accuracy to chance level ($10.0\% \pm 0.5\%$). Photonic
quantum computing's room-temperature operation, inherent scalability through
spatial-mode multiplexing, and HPC-integrated architecture establish a
practical pathway for distributed quantum machine learning, combining the
expressivity of photonic Hilbert spaces with the deployability of classical
neural networks.

Motivation: 块稀疏信号的结构模式未知是结构化稀疏信号重建中的核心挑战，现有方法难以统一且参数估计困难。

Method: 提出方差变换框架，结合空域功率先验和EM算法，开发了SPP-SBL方法，通过高阶方程根求解自适应学习空间耦合参数。

Result: SPP-SBL在多种结构化稀疏信号（如链式结构、多模式信号）及实际多模态信号（图像、音频）恢复中表现优越，恢复精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 学习空间耦合参数的相对值是捕捉未知块稀疏模式和提高恢复精度的关键，SPP-SBL为结构化稀疏信号重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recovery of block-sparse signals with unknown structural patterns remains
a fundamental challenge in structured sparse signal reconstruction. By
proposing a variance transformation framework, this paper unifies existing
pattern-based block sparse Bayesian learning methods, and introduces a novel
space power prior based on undirected graph models to adaptively capture the
unknown patterns of block-sparse signals. By combining the EM algorithm with
high-order equation root-solving, we develop a new structured sparse Bayesian
learning method, SPP-SBL, which effectively addresses the open problem of space
coupling parameter estimation in pattern-based methods. We further demonstrate
that learning the relative values of space coupling parameters is key to
capturing unknown block-sparse patterns and improving recovery accuracy.
Experiments validate that SPP-SBL successfully recovers various challenging
structured sparse signals (e.g., chain-structured signals and multi-pattern
sparse signals) and real-world multi-modal structured sparse signals (images,
audio), showing significant advantages in recovery accuracy across multiple
metrics.

Abstract: Most work in AI music generation focused on audio, which has seen limited use
in the music production industry due to its rigidity. To maximize flexibility
while assuming only textual instructions from producers, we are among the first
to tackle symbolic music editing. We circumvent the known challenge of lack of

drum grooves. The recipe of success is a creatively designed format that
interfaces LLMs and music, while we facilitate evaluation by providing an
evaluation dataset with annotated unit tests that highly aligns with musicians'
judgment.

Motivation: 现有的文本到音频系统推理速度较慢，延迟较高，限制了其在创意应用中的实用性。为了解决这一问题，研究提出了无需蒸馏的对抗性加速算法。

Method: ARC后训练方法结合了相对对抗性训练和新颖的对比判别器目标，以提升提示的依从性，并进一步优化了Stable Audio Open模型。

Result: 在H100上实现了约12秒的44.1kHz立体声音频生成仅需75毫秒，边缘设备上约7秒，是目前最快的文本到音频模型。

Conclusion: ARC后训练方法显著提升了文本到音频系统的推理速度，为创意应用提供了实用化的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference
time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We
present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first
adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on
distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to
compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is
a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial
formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel
contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We
pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and
build a model capable of generating $\approx$12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in
$\approx$75ms on an H100, and $\approx$7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest
text-to-audio model to our knowledge.

Conclusion: SpectMamba通过线性复杂度结构和半监督学习策略，有效解决了歌唱旋律提取中的计算效率和数据稀缺问题，为音乐信息检索领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Singing melody extraction (SME) is a key task in the field of music
information retrieval. However, existing methods are facing several
limitations: firstly, prior models use transformers to capture the contextual
dependencies, which requires quadratic computation resulting in low efficiency
in the inference stage. Secondly, prior works typically rely on
frequencysupervised methods to estimate the fundamental frequency (f0), which
ignores that the musical performance is actually based on notes. Thirdly,
transformers typically require large amounts of labeled data to achieve optimal
performances, but the SME task lacks of sufficient annotated data. To address
these issues, in this paper, we propose a mamba-based network, called
SpectMamba, for semi-supervised singing melody extraction using confidence
binary regularization. In particular, we begin by introducing vision mamba to
achieve computational linear complexity. Then, we propose a novel note-f0
decoder that allows the model to better mimic the musical performance. Further,
to alleviate the scarcity of the labeled data, we introduce a confidence binary
regularization (CBR) module to leverage the unlabeled data by maximizing the
probability of the correct classes. The proposed method is evaluated on several
public datasets and the conducted experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了SciCom Wiki平台，旨在通过FAIR原则和神经符号计算事实检查工具，提升科学传播知识基础设施（SciCom KI）的可扩展性和协作性，以应对视频和播客中的信息泛滥和错误信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 民主社会需要可靠且易获取的信息，但视频和播客作为主要传播媒介也携带大量错误信息，而现有的科学传播知识基础设施（SciCom KI）尚不足以应对这一挑战。

Method: 研究通过调查53位利益相关者的需求，开发了基于Wikibase的SciCom Wiki平台，并采用神经符号计算方法将异构媒体转换为知识图谱以支持事实检查。

Result: 通过对14名参与者的原型评估和43名用户的公开调查，研究验证了平台的必要性和可用性，并发现SciCom KI在FAIR知识和协作系统方面亟待发展。

Conclusion: SciCom Wiki及其事实检查工具能够满足需求，但应对信息泛滥仍需更大规模的协作努力。

Abstract: Democratic societies need accessible, reliable information. Videos and
Podcasts have established themselves as the medium of choice for civic
dissemination, but also as carriers of misinformation. The emerging Science
Communication Knowledge Infrastructure (SciCom KI) curating non-textual media
is still fragmented and not adequately equipped to scale against the content
flood. Our work sets out to support the SciCom KI with a central, collaborative
platform, the SciCom Wiki, to facilitate FAIR (findable, accessible,
interoperable, reusable) media representation and the fact-checking of their
content, particularly for videos and podcasts. Building an open-source service
system centered around Wikibase, we survey requirements from 53 stakeholders,
refine these in 11 interviews, and evaluate our prototype based on these
requirements with another 14 participants. To address the most requested
feature, fact-checking, we developed a neurosymbolic computational
fact-checking approach, converting heterogenous media into knowledge graphs.
This increases machine-readability and allows comparing statements against
equally represented ground-truth. Our computational fact-checking tool was
iteratively evaluated through 10 expert interviews, a public user survey with
43 participants verified the necessity and usability of our tool. Overall, our
findings identified several needs to systematically support the SciCom KI. The
SciCom Wiki, as a FAIR digital library complementing our neurosymbolic
computational fact-checking framework, was found suitable to address the raised
requirements. Further, we identified that the SciCom KI is severely
underdeveloped regarding FAIR knowledge and related systems facilitating its
collaborative creation and curation. Our system can provide a central knowledge
node, yet a collaborative effort is required to scale against the imminent
(mis-)information flood.

Abstract: Microstructure often dictates materials performance, yet it is rarely treated
as an explicit design variable because microstructure is hard to quantify,
predict, and optimize. Here, we introduce an image centric, closed-loop
framework that makes microstructural morphology into a controllable objective
and demonstrate its use case with Li- and Mn-rich layered oxide cathode
precursors. This work presents an integrated, AI driven framework for the
predictive design and optimization of lithium-ion battery cathode precursor
synthesis. This framework integrates a diffusion-based image generation model,
a quantitative image analysis pipeline, and a particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm. By extracting key morphological descriptors such as texture,
sphericity, and median particle size (D50) from SEM images, the platform
accurately predicts SEM like morphologies resulting from specific
coprecipitation conditions, including reaction time-, solution concentration-,
and pH-dependent structural changes. Optimization then pinpoints synthesis
parameters that yield user defined target morphologies, as experimentally
validated by the close agreement between predicted and synthesized structures.
This framework offers a practical strategy for data driven materials design,
enabling both forward prediction and inverse design of synthesis conditions and
paving the way toward autonomous, image guided microstructure engineering.

Abstract: Understanding multicomponent complex material systems is essential for design
of advanced materials for a wide range of technological applications. While
state-of-the-art crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods effectively
identify new structures and assess phase stability, they face fundamental
limitations when applied to complex systems. This challenge stems from the
combinatorial explosion of atomic configurations and the vast stoichiometric
space, both of which contribute to computational demands that rapidly exceed
practical feasibility. In this work, we propose a flexible and automated
workflow to build a highly generalizable and data-efficient machine learning
potential (MLP), effectively unlocking the full potential of CSP algorithms.
The workflow is validated on both Mg-Ca-H ternary and Be-P-N-O quaternary
systems, demonstrating substantial machine learning acceleration in
high-throughput structural optimization and enabling the efficient
identification of promising compounds. These results underscore the
effectiveness of our approach in exploring complex material systems and
accelerating the discovery of new multicomponent materials.

Abstract: Longitudinal imaging analysis tracks disease progression and treatment
response over time, providing dynamic insights into treatment efficacy and
disease evolution. Radiomic features extracted from medical imaging can support
the study of disease progression and facilitate longitudinal prediction of
clinical outcomes. This study presents a probabilistic model for longitudinal
response prediction, integrating baseline features with intermediate
follow-ups. The probabilistic nature of the model naturally allows to handle
the instrinsic uncertainty of the longitudinal prediction of disease
progression. We evaluate the proposed model against state-of-the-art disease
progression models in both a synthetic scenario and using a brain cancer
dataset. Results demonstrate that the approach is competitive against existing
methods while uniquely accounting for uncertainty and controlling the growth of
problem dimensionality, eliminating the need for data from intermediate
follow-ups.

### [213] [Contrastive Normalizing Flows for Uncertainty-Aware Parameter Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08709)
*Ibrahim Elsharkawy,Yonatan Kahn*

Main category: physics.data-an

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于对比归一化流（CNFs）的新方法，用于解决高维参数估计中数据分布偏移导致的系统不确定性问题，并在HiggsML不确定性挑战数据集上取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习的参数估计在物理科学中至关重要，但数据分布偏移（如探测器校准错误）会导致统计精度下降。目前，在高能物理（HEP）和更广泛的机器学习领域，如何在数据分布偏移下实现具有不确定性感知的参数估计仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于对比归一化流（CNFs）的新方法，利用二元分类器近似模型参数似然比，并通过嵌入学习和对比分布生成，解决了高维参数网格模拟的高成本问题。

Result: 该方法在HiggsML不确定性挑战数据集上表现优异，并通过理论分析和实证评估验证了其在数据分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合分类器和经典频域技术，CNFs提供了一种对数据分布偏移鲁棒的参数估计和不确定性量化框架。

Abstract: Estimating physical parameters from data is a crucial application of machine
learning (ML) in the physical sciences. However, systematic uncertainties, such
as detector miscalibration, induce data distribution distortions that can erode
statistical precision. In both high-energy physics (HEP) and broader ML
contexts, achieving uncertainty-aware parameter estimation under these domain
shifts remains an open problem. In this work, we address this challenge of
uncertainty-aware parameter estimation for a broad set of tasks critical for
HEP. We introduce a novel approach based on Contrastive Normalizing Flows
(CNFs), which achieves top performance on the HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge
dataset. Building on the insight that a binary classifier can approximate the
model parameter likelihood ratio, we address the practical limitations of
expressivity and the high cost of simulating high-dimensional parameter grids
by embedding data and parameters in a learned CNF mapping. This mapping yields
a tunable contrastive distribution that enables robust classification under
shifted data distributions. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and
empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that CNFs, when coupled with a classifier
and established frequentist techniques, provide principled parameter estimation
and uncertainty quantification through classification that is robust to data
distribution distortions.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合生成模型,用于高效采样高维多模态概率分布以进行贝叶斯推断。通过分治策略识别模态、训练分类器和扩散模型,最终利用桥接采样调整模态比例,在100维空间内有效处理多模态分布。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统蒙特卡洛方法（如Metropolis-Hastings和Langevin蒙特卡洛）在高维单模态分布中表现良好，但在多模态分布中难以正确采样各模态比例，尤其当模态分离明显时。因此需要新方法解决多模态挑战。

Conclusion: 所提框架通过结合分治策略和生成模型，显著提升了高维多模态分布的采样效率与准确性，为复杂贝叶斯推断问题提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid generative model for efficient sampling of
high-dimensional, multimodal probability distributions for Bayesian inference.
Traditional Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings and Langevin
Monte Carlo sampling methods, are effective for sampling from single-mode
distributions in high-dimensional spaces. However, these methods struggle to
produce samples with the correct proportions for each mode in multimodal
distributions, especially for distributions with well separated modes. To
address the challenges posed by multimodality, we adopt a divide-and-conquer
strategy. We start by minimizing the energy function with initial guesses
uniformly distributed within the prior domain to identify all the modes of the
energy function. Then, we train a classifier to segment the domain
corresponding to each mode. After the domain decomposition, we train a
diffusion-model-assisted generative model for each identified mode within its
support. Once each mode is characterized, we employ bridge sampling to estimate
the normalizing constant, allowing us to directly adjust the ratios between the
modes. Our numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework can
effectively handle multimodal distributions with varying mode shapes in up to
100 dimensions. An application to Bayesian inverse problem for partial
differential equations is also provided.

Motivation: 分布鲁棒优化在模型不确定性下的预测和决策中表现出强大能力，但非参数框架的研究较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，尤其关注模型误设对泛化性能的影响。

Method: 通过分析分布扰动引起的正则化效应，并采用带Lipschitz约束的前馈神经网络，建立了局部最坏情况风险的超量风险的非渐近误差界。

Result: 研究结果表明，不确定性水平和神经网络结构显著影响泛化性能，且在Lipschitz和二次损失函数中均适用。模拟和MNIST数据集应用验证了估计器的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在非参数框架下有效提升了分布鲁棒估计的泛化能力，为模型不确定性下的决策提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization has become a powerful tool for
prediction and decision-making under model uncertainty. By focusing on the
local worst-case risk, it enhances robustness by identifying the most
unfavorable distribution within a predefined ambiguity set. While extensive
research has been conducted in parametric settings, studies on nonparametric
frameworks remain limited. This paper studies the generalization properties of
Wasserstein distributionally robust nonparametric estimators, with particular
attention to the impact of model misspecification, where non-negligible
discrepancies between the estimation function space and target function can
impair generalization performance. We establish non-asymptotic error bounds for
the excess local worst-case risk by analyzing the regularization effects
induced by distributional perturbations and employing feedforward neural
networks with Lipschitz constraints. These bounds illustrate how uncertainty
levels and neural network structures influence generalization performance and
are applicable to both Lipschitz and quadratic loss functions. Furthermore, we
investigate the Lagrangian relaxation of the local worst-case risk and derive
corresponding non-asymptotic error bounds for these estimators. The robustness
of the proposed estimator is evaluated through simulation studies and
illustrated with an application to the MNIST dataset.

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained traction in privacy-sensitive collaborative
environments, with local SGD emerging as a key optimization method in
decentralized settings. While its convergence properties are well-studied,
asymptotic statistical guarantees beyond convergence remain limited. In this
paper, we present two generalized Gaussian approximation results for local SGD
and explore their implications. First, we prove a Berry-Esseen theorem for the
final local SGD iterates, enabling valid multiplier bootstrap procedures.
Second, motivated by robustness considerations, we introduce two distinct
time-uniform Gaussian approximations for the entire trajectory of local SGD.
The time-uniform approximations support Gaussian bootstrap-based tests for
detecting adversarial attacks. Extensive simulations are provided to support
our theoretical results.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for trustworthy
machine learning (ML), particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare
and finance. Shapley value (SV) methods provide a principled framework for
feature attribution in complex models but incur high computational costs,
limiting their scalability in high-dimensional settings. We propose Stochastic
Iterative Momentum for Shapley Value Approximation (SIM-Shapley), a stable and
efficient SV approximation method inspired by stochastic optimization. We
analyze variance theoretically, prove linear $Q$-convergence, and demonstrate
improved empirical stability and low bias in practice on real-world datasets.
In our numerical experiments, SIM-Shapley reduces computation time by up to 85%
relative to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable feature
attribution quality. Beyond feature attribution, our stochastic mini-batch
iterative framework extends naturally to a broader class of sample average
approximation problems, offering a new avenue for improving computational
efficiency with stability guarantees. Code is publicly available at

enforcement of smooth models using vector fields. Finally, we extend work on
symmetry discovery using vector fields by providing both theoretical and
experimental material on the restriction of the symmetry search space to
infinitesimal isometries.

Conclusion: 结论指出，神经网络的优势并非不可替代，核方法在低维和层次学习上同样表现优异，这为机器学习领域提供了更多方法论选择。

Abstract: The impressive practical performance of neural networks is often attributed
to their ability to learn low-dimensional data representations and hierarchical
structure directly from data. In this work, we argue that these two phenomena
are not unique to neural networks, and can be elicited from classical kernel
methods. Namely, we show that the derivative of the kernel predictor can detect
the influential coordinates with low sample complexity. Moreover, by
iteratively using the derivatives to reweight the data and retrain kernel
machines, one is able to efficiently learn hierarchical polynomials with finite
leap complexity. Numerical experiments illustrate the developed theory.

Motivation: 精准医疗中，许多治疗伴随不可忽视的副作用。若患者未从治疗中获益，则会遭受不必要的伤害。因此，需要一种方法在优化治疗方案的同时，确保治疗风险可控。

Conclusion: 该研究为精准医疗中的治疗方案优化提供了一种可靠的方法，尤其在数据有限且治疗风险不确定的情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Learning beneficial treatment allocations for a patient population is an
important problem in precision medicine. Many treatments come with adverse side
effects that are not commensurable with their potential benefits. Patients who
do not receive benefits after such treatments are thereby subjected to
unnecessary harm. This is a `treatment risk' that we aim to control when
learning beneficial allocations. The constrained learning problem is challenged
by the fact that the treatment risk is not in general identifiable using either
randomized trial or observational data. We propose a certifiable learning
method that controls the treatment risk with finite samples in the partially
identified setting. The method is illustrated using both simulated and real
data.

Abstract: Nowadays, Neural Networks are considered one of the most effective methods
for various tasks such as anomaly detection, computer-aided disease detection,
or natural language processing. However, these networks suffer from the
``black-box'' problem which makes it difficult to understand how they make
decisions. In order to solve this issue, an R package called neuralGAM is
introduced. This package implements a Neural Network topology based on
Generalized Additive Models, allowing to fit an independent Neural Network to
estimate the contribution of each feature to the output variable, yielding a
highly accurate and interpretable Deep Learning model. The neuralGAM package
provides a flexible framework for training Generalized Additive Neural
Networks, which does not impose any restrictions on the Neural Network
architecture. We illustrate the use of the neuralGAM package in both synthetic
and real data examples.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在有限时间内实现对计算昂贵模型的可靠、快速和重复的贝叶斯推理。

Conclusion: UA-SABI有效解决了高计算成本模型的贝叶斯推理问题，同时控制了代理模型引入的不确定性。

Abstract: Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to
estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally
challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating
sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which
is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by
providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the
generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced
approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior
estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based
Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) - a framework that combines surrogate
modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate
uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this
approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for
computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.

Abstract: Modeling the continuous--time dynamics of probability distributions from
time--dependent data samples is a fundamental problem in many fields, including
digital health. The aim is to analyze how the distribution of a biomarker, such
as glucose, evolves over time and how these changes may reflect the progression
of chronic diseases such as diabetes. In this paper, we propose a novel
probabilistic model based on a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture how
samples from a continuous-time stochastic process evolve over the time. To
model potential distribution shifts over time, we introduce a time-dependent
function parameterized by a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE)
and estimate it non--parametrically using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).
The proposed model is highly interpretable, detects subtle temporal shifts, and
remains computationally efficient. Through simulation studies, we show that it
performs competitively in terms of estimation accuracy against
state-of-the-art, less interpretable methods such as normalized gradient--flows
and non--parameteric kernel density estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of our method on digital clinical--trial data, showing how the
interventions alters the time-dependent distribution of glucose levels and
enabling a rigorous comparison of control and treatment groups from novel
mathematical and clinical perspectives.

*Abhineet Agarwal,Michael Xiao,Rebecca Barter,Omer Ronen,Boyu Fan,Bin Yu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于PCS框架的不确定性量化方法（PCS-UQ），通过模型筛选和多重引导训练改进传统方法的不足，实验证明其在覆盖率和预测区间宽度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性量化方法依赖生成模型假设，对模型误设不鲁棒；而共形推理虽适用于任意模型，但忽略模型选择导致预测区间过大。因此，需开发一种兼顾鲁棒性和效率的方法。

Method: PCS-UQ结合PCS框架，通过预测检查筛选模型，并在多重引导训练中评估样本间变异性和算法不稳定性，同时提出局部自适应校准方案。针对深度学习模型，设计了计算高效的近似方案。

Result: 在17个回归和6个分类数据集上，PCS-UQ达到目标覆盖率，预测区间宽度比共形方法减少约20%。在计算机视觉任务中，区间大小进一步减少20%，且亚组覆盖更优。

Conclusion: PCS-UQ通过整合模型选择和稳定性评估，显著提升了不确定性量化的可靠性，理论分析表明其改进版本满足数据可交换性下的覆盖保证。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, trustworthy uncertainty quantification (UQ) is critical for ensuring
the safety and reliability of these models. Traditional UQ methods rely on
specifying a true generative model and are not robust to misspecification. On
the other hand, conformal inference allows for arbitrary ML models but does not
consider model selection, which leads to large interval sizes. We tackle these
drawbacks by proposing a UQ method based on the predictability, computability,
and stability (PCS) framework for veridical data science proposed by Yu and
Kumbier. Specifically, PCS-UQ addresses model selection by using a prediction
check to screen out unsuitable models. PCS-UQ then fits these screened
algorithms across multiple bootstraps to assess inter-sample variability and
algorithmic instability, enabling more reliable uncertainty estimates. Further,
we propose a novel calibration scheme that improves local adaptivity of our
prediction sets. Experiments across $17$ regression and $6$ classification
datasets show that PCS-UQ achieves the desired coverage and reduces width over
conformal approaches by $\approx 20\%$. Further, our local analysis shows
PCS-UQ often achieves target coverage across subgroups while conformal methods
fail to do so. For large deep-learning models, we propose computationally
efficient approximation schemes that avoid the expensive multiple bootstrap
trainings of PCS-UQ. Across three computer vision benchmarks, PCS-UQ reduces
prediction set size over conformal methods by $20\%$. Theoretically, we show a
modified PCS-UQ algorithm is a form of split conformal inference and achieves
the desired coverage with exchangeable data.

Abstract: Assessments of trustworthiness have become a cornerstone of responsible AI
development. Especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare, aligning
technical, evidence-based, and ethical practices with forthcoming legal
requirements is increasingly urgent. We argue that developers and deployers of
AI systems for the medical domain should be proactive and take steps to
progressively ensure that such systems, both those currently in use and those
being developed or planned, respect the requirements of the AI Act, which has
come into force in August 2024. This is necessary if full and effective
compliance is to be ensured when the most relevant provisions of the Act become
effective (August 2026). The engagement with the AI Act cannot be viewed as a
formalistic exercise. Compliance with the AI Act needs to be carried out
through the proactive commitment to the ethical principles of trustworthy AI.
These principles provide the background for the Act, which mentions them
several times and connects them to the protection of public interest. They can
be used to interpret and apply the Act's provisions and to identify good

### [227] [Multimodal Assessment of Classroom Discourse Quality: A Text-Centered Attention-Based Multi-Task Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07902)
*Ruikun Hou,Babette Bühler,Tim Fütterer,Efe Bozkir,Peter Gerjets,Ulrich Trautwein,Enkelejda Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的多模态融合架构，用于自动化评估课堂教学中三个关键话语组件的质量，结合文本、音频和视频数据，并通过实验验证了其与人类评分的可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课堂话语质量评估依赖人工编码，效率低且成本高。现有AI技术多限于单句分析，缺乏对整个教学段话语质量的评估方法。

Method: 采用注意力机制捕捉多模态交互，多任务学习联合预测三个话语组件的质量，并将任务建模为有序分类问题。

Result: 在德国GTI数据集上的实验表明，文本模态起主导作用，结合声学特征后模型与人类评分的一致性提高，总体Quadratic Weighted Kappa得分达0.384。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化话语质量评估奠定了基础，未来可通过多维反馈支持教师专业发展。

Abstract: Classroom discourse is an essential vehicle through which teaching and
learning take place. Assessing different characteristics of discursive
practices and linking them to student learning achievement enhances the
understanding of teaching quality. Traditional assessments rely on manual
coding of classroom observation protocols, which is time-consuming and costly.
Despite many studies utilizing AI techniques to analyze classroom discourse at
the utterance level, investigations into the evaluation of discursive practices
throughout an entire lesson segment remain limited. To address this gap, our
study proposes a novel text-centered multimodal fusion architecture to assess
the quality of three discourse components grounded in the Global Teaching
InSights (GTI) observation protocol: Nature of Discourse, Questioning, and
Explanations. First, we employ attention mechanisms to capture inter- and
intra-modal interactions from transcript, audio, and video streams. Second, a
multi-task learning approach is adopted to jointly predict the quality scores
of the three components. Third, we formulate the task as an ordinal
classification problem to account for rating level order. The effectiveness of
these designed elements is demonstrated through an ablation study on the GTI
Germany dataset containing 92 videotaped math lessons. Our results highlight
the dominant role of text modality in approaching this task. Integrating
acoustic features enhances the model's consistency with human ratings,
achieving an overall Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.384, comparable to
human inter-rater reliability (0.326). Our study lays the groundwork for the
future development of automated discourse quality assessment to support teacher
professional development through timely feedback on multidimensional discourse
practices.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出LECTOR模型，结合阅读内容和活动数据提升教育分析，实验显示在信息提取和学生表现预测上有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教育电子书平台主要依赖阅读活动数据，而阅读内容数据常被忽视，研究旨在填补这一空白，提升教育分析的全面性。

Method: 提出LECTOR模型，整合阅读内容数据（如讲座幻灯片）与活动数据，通过NLP技术提取关键信息并进行实验验证。

Result: LECTOR在信息提取上F1-score平均提升5%，学生评估中进一步提升21%；在预测低分学生时，整合LECTOR数据表现出改进趋势。

Conclusion: LECTOR模型证明了阅读内容数据的价值，为个性化教育干预提供了新的数据支持，未来可进一步优化应用。

Abstract: Educational e-book platforms provide valuable information to teachers and
researchers through two main sources: reading activity data and reading content
data. While reading activity data is commonly used to analyze learning
strategies and predict low-performing students, reading content data is often
overlooked in these analyses. To address this gap, this study proposes LECTOR
(Lecture slides and Topic Relationships), a model that summarizes information
from reading content in a format that can be easily integrated with reading
activity data. Our first experiment compared LECTOR to representative Natural
Language Processing (NLP) models in extracting key information from 2,255
lecture slides, showing an average improvement of 5% in F1-score. These results
were further validated through a human evaluation involving 28 students, which
showed an average improvement of 21% in F1-score over a model predominantly
used in current educational tools. Our second experiment compared reading
preferences extracted by LECTOR with traditional reading activity data in
predicting low-performing students using 600,712 logs from 218 students. The
results showed a tendency to improve the predictive performance by integrating
LECTOR. Finally, we proposed examples showing the potential application of the
reading preferences extracted by LECTOR in designing personalized interventions
for students.

### [229] [One Bad NOFO? AI Governance in Federal Grantmaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08133)
*Dan Bateyko,Karen Levy*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 美国联邦机构通过拨款政策间接管理AI，但现有研究不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨联邦机构如何通过拨款政策影响AI的治理，填补研究空白。

Method: 分析2009至2024年间超4万份非国防联邦拨款通知，筛选提及AI的记录并研究其内容。

Result: 发现机构在拨款叙述中推广AI，但少有明确的AI评判标准或限制，尤其在涉及人权领域时监管不足。

Conclusion: 拨款通知是AI政策制定的一个被忽视的领域，需更透明、负责和隐私保护的改进建议。

Abstract: Much scholarship considers how U.S. federal agencies govern artificial
intelligence (AI) through rulemaking and their own internal use policies. But
agencies have an overlooked AI governance role: setting discretionary grant
policy when directing billions of dollars in federal financial assistance.
These dollars enable state and local entities to study, create, and use AI.
This funding not only goes to dedicated AI programs, but also to grantees using
AI in the course of meeting their routine grant objectives. As discretionary
grantmakers, agencies guide and restrict what grant winners do -- a hidden
lever for AI governance. Agencies pull this lever by setting program
objectives, judging criteria, and restrictions for AI use. Using a novel
dataset of over 40,000 non-defense federal grant notices of funding opportunity
(NOFOs) posted to Grants.gov between 2009 and 2024, we analyze how agencies
regulate the use of AI by grantees. We select records mentioning AI and review
their stated goals and requirements. We find agencies promoting AI in notice
narratives, shaping adoption in ways other records of grant policy might fail
to capture. Of the grant opportunities that mention AI, we find only a handful
of AI-specific judging criteria or restrictions. This silence holds even when
agencies fund AI uses in contexts affecting people's rights and which, under an
analogous federal procurement regime, would result in extra oversight. These
findings recast grant notices as a site of AI policymaking -- albeit one that
is developing out of step with other regulatory efforts and incomplete in its
consideration of transparency, accountability, and privacy protections. The
paper concludes by drawing lessons from AI procurement scholarship, while
identifying distinct challenges in grantmaking that invite further study.

### [230] [Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08319)
*Egil Diau*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个三阶段自下而上的框架，用于从最小认知的个体互动中模拟社会结构的涌现，弥补了多智能体AI中社会结构模拟的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的AI和经济社会学中，社会结构（如制度与规范）往往被静态描述，缺乏对其自下而上涌现过程的模拟。本文旨在通过基于个体行为的框架填补这一空白。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：互惠动态（个体交换）、规范稳定化（共享期望）、制度构建（模式外化为结构）。通过最小认知的互动模拟社会结构的涌现。

Result: 框架能够系统性地探索道德、文化和制度结构如何从个体互动中涌现，为相关研究提供可操作的模型基础。

Conclusion: 基于个体互惠行为的框架实现了社会结构的动态重建，为理论与应用研究开辟了新路径。

Abstract: A major bottleneck in multi-agent AI is the lack of simulateable models for
the bottom-up emergence of social structure under realistic behavioral
constraints. Similarly, many foundational theories in economics and sociology
including the concepts of "institutions" and "norms" tend to describe social
structures post hoc, often relying on implicit assumptions of shared culture,
morality, or symbolic agreement. These concepts are often treated as primitives
rather than reconstructed from agent-level behavior, leaving both their origins
and operational definitions under-specified. To address this, we propose a
three-stage bottom-up framework: Reciprocal Dynamics, capturing
individual-level reciprocal exchanges; Norm Stabilization, the consolidation of
shared expectations; and Institutional Construction, the externalization of
stable patterns into scalable structures. By grounding social emergence in
agent-level reciprocity, our framework enables the systematic exploration of
how moral, cultural, and institutional structures emerge from cognitively
minimal interactions.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了14,904个自定义GPT，发现95%以上存在安全漏洞，包括角色扮演攻击、系统提示泄露等。研究发现OpenAI的基础模型存在固有安全弱点，呼吁加强安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自定义GPT的广泛使用，其安全漏洞问题日益突出。现有研究多为理论探讨，缺乏大规模实证分析，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 研究者分析了14,904个自定义GPT，评估其对七种可攻击威胁的易感性，并引入多指标排名系统评估其安全风险。

Result: 研究发现95%以上的自定义GPT缺乏足够安全保护，主要漏洞包括角色扮演攻击(96.51%)、系统提示泄露(92.20%)和钓鱼(91.22%)。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自定义GPT的严重安全风险，呼吁加强安全措施和内容审核，以确保GPT应用的安全部署。

Abstract: Millions of users leverage generative pretrained transformer (GPT)-based
language models developed by leading model providers for a wide range of tasks.
To support enhanced user interaction and customization, many platforms-such as
OpenAI-now enable developers to create and publish tailored model instances,
known as custom GPTs, via dedicated repositories or application stores. These
custom GPTs empower users to browse and interact with specialized applications
designed to meet specific needs. However, as custom GPTs see growing adoption,
concerns regarding their security vulnerabilities have intensified. Existing
research on these vulnerabilities remains largely theoretical, often lacking
empirical, large-scale, and statistically rigorous assessments of associated
risks.
  In this study, we analyze 14,904 custom GPTs to assess their susceptibility
to seven exploitable threats, such as roleplay-based attacks, system prompt
leakage, phishing content generation, and malicious code synthesis, across
various categories and popularity tiers within the OpenAI marketplace. We
introduce a multi-metric ranking system to examine the relationship between a
custom GPT's popularity and its associated security risks.
  Our findings reveal that over 95% of custom GPTs lack adequate security
protections. The most prevalent vulnerabilities include roleplay-based
vulnerabilities (96.51%), system prompt leakage (92.20%), and phishing
(91.22%). Furthermore, we demonstrate that OpenAI's foundational models exhibit
inherent security weaknesses, which are often inherited or amplified in custom
GPTs. These results highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures
and stricter content moderation to ensure the safe deployment of GPT-based
applications.

Motivation: 智能电表数据虽具分析价值，但存在隐私风险，需在加州严格隐私法规下实现数据效用最大化。

Method: 结合数据匿名化、隐私保护机器学习（差分隐私/联邦学习）、合成数据生成及加密技术（安全多方计算/同态加密），设计混合架构。

Result: 提出的架构在满足法规的同时支持高级分析（如预测、个性化洞察），通过数学证明确保隐私性与实用性。

Conclusion: 研究为公用事业数据科学家提供了隐私优先的AMIDATA处理蓝图，兼顾创新与合规。

Abstract: Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data from smart electric and gas
meters enables valuable insights for utilities and consumers, but also raises
significant privacy concerns. In California, regulatory decisions (CPUC
D.11-07-056 and D.11-08-045) mandate strict privacy protections for customer
energy usage data, guided by the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs).
We comprehensively explore solutions drawn from data anonymization,
privacy-preserving machine learning (differential privacy and federated
learning), synthetic data generation, and cryptographic techniques (secure
multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption). This allows advanced
analytics, including machine learning models, statistical and econometric
analysis on energy consumption data, to be performed without compromising
individual privacy.
  We evaluate each technique's theoretical foundations, effectiveness, and
trade-offs in the context of utility data analytics, and we propose an
integrated architecture that combines these methods to meet real-world needs.
The proposed hybrid architecture is designed to ensure compliance with
California's privacy rules and FIPPs while enabling useful analytics, from
forecasting and personalized insights to academic research and econometrics,
while strictly protecting individual privacy. Mathematical definitions and
derivations are provided where appropriate to demonstrate privacy guarantees
and utility implications rigorously. We include comparative evaluations of the
techniques, an architecture diagram, and flowcharts to illustrate how they work
together in practice. The result is a blueprint for utility data scientists and
engineers to implement privacy-by-design in AMI data handling, supporting both
data-driven innovation and strict regulatory compliance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG技术的广泛应用，如何保护敏感数据和服务安全成为关键问题，本文旨在解决其安全与隐私挑战。

Method: 论文首先分析了RAG管道的漏洞和攻击面，然后提出了一个结合RAG特定安全考量和现有标准的安全框架。

Result: 论文提出了一种结构化的安全框架，能够帮助实现稳健、合规、安全和可信的RAG系统。

Conclusion: 通过结合RAG特定安全考量和现有标准，本文为解决RAG系统的安全和隐私问题提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry
standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate
data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This
capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces
novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is
integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has
become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG
pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data
storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then
paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second
step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security
considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards,
and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of
robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态策略成功结合了结构化生物数据和语言模型，提升了单细胞数据分析的生物学解释性和适用性。

Abstract: Understanding cell identity and function through single-cell level sequencing
data remains a key challenge in computational biology. We present a novel
framework that leverages gene-specific textual annotations from the NCBI Gene
database to generate biologically contextualized cell embeddings. For each cell
in a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, we rank genes by
expression level, retrieve their NCBI Gene descriptions, and transform these
descriptions into vector embedding representations using large language models
(LLMs). The models used include OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002,
text-embedding-3-small, and text-embedding-3-large (Jan 2024), as well as
domain-specific models BioBERT and SciBERT. Embeddings are computed via an
expression-weighted average across the top N most highly expressed genes in
each cell, providing a compact, semantically rich representation. This
multimodal strategy bridges structured biological data with state-of-the-art
language modeling, enabling more interpretable downstream applications such as
cell-type clustering, cell vulnerability dissection, and trajectory inference.

Abstract: As large-scale social data explode and machine-learning methods evolve,
scholars of entrepreneurship and innovation face new research opportunities but
also unique challenges. This chapter discusses the difficulties of leveraging
large-scale data to identify technological and commercial novelty, document new
venture origins, and forecast competition between new technologies and
commercial forms. It suggests how scholars can take advantage of new text,
network, image, audio, and video data in two distinct ways that advance
innovation and entrepreneurship research. First, machine-learning models,
combined with large-scale data, enable the construction of precision
measurements that function as system-level observatories of innovation and
entrepreneurship across human societies. Second, new artificial intelligence
models fueled by big data generate 'digital doubles' of technology and
business, forming laboratories for virtual experimentation about innovation and
entrepreneurship processes and policies. The chapter argues for the advancement
of theory development and testing in entrepreneurship and innovation by
coupling big data with big models.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been a long-standing candidate for
processing of temporal sequence data, especially in memory-constrained systems
that one may find in embedded edge computing environments. Recent advances in
training paradigms have now inspired new generations of efficient RNNs. We
introduce a streamlined and hardware-compatible architecture based on minimal
gated recurrent units (GRUs), and an accompanying efficient mixed-signal
hardware implementation of the model. The proposed design leverages
switched-capacitor circuits not only for in-memory computation (IMC), but also
for the gated state updates. The mixed-signal cores rely solely on commodity
circuits consisting of metal capacitors, transmission gates, and a clocked
comparator, thus greatly facilitating scaling and transfer to other technology
nodes.
  We benchmark the performance of our architecture on time series data,
introducing all constraints required for a direct mapping to the hardware
system. The direct compatibility is verified in mixed-signal simulations,
reproducing data recorded from the software-only network model.

Motivation: 随着AI在训练、摘要生成和内容修改等任务中频繁与在线内容交互，现有监管方法（如robots.txt）缺乏足够的精细度和语义表达能力，难以确保AI行为的合规性，因此需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: 设计了ai.txt这一DSL，扩展了基于URL的访问控制，支持元素级精准调控和可被AI解析的自然语言指令；开发了集成开发环境（IDE），提供代码补全和自动XML生成；提出两种合规机制：基于XML的程序化执行和自然语言提示集成。

Abstract: We introduce ai.txt, a novel domain-specific language (DSL) designed to
explicitly regulate interactions between AI models, agents, and web content,
addressing critical limitations of the widely adopted robots.txt standard. As
AI increasingly engages with online materials for tasks such as training,
summarization, and content modification, existing regulatory methods lack the
necessary granularity and semantic expressiveness to ensure ethical and legal
compliance. ai.txt extends traditional URL-based access controls by enabling
precise element-level regulations and incorporating natural language
instructions interpretable by AI systems. To facilitate practical deployment,
we provide an integrated development environment with code autocompletion and
automatic XML generation. Furthermore, we propose two compliance mechanisms:
XML-based programmatic enforcement and natural language prompt integration, and
demonstrate their effectiveness through preliminary experiments and case
studies. Our approach aims to aid the governance of AI-Internet interactions,
promoting responsible AI use in digital ecosystems.

Conclusion: 智能产品3.0通过结合区块链和AI技术，为未来智能产品的发展提供了新方向，强调了去中心化和自主性的重要性。

Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, the specification of the Intelligent Product was
established, envisaging real-time connectivity that not only enables products
to gather accurate data about themselves but also allows them to assess and
influence their own destiny. Early work by the Auto-ID project focused on
creating a single, open-standard repository for storing and retrieving product
information, laying a foundation for scalable connectivity. A decade later, the
approach was revisited in light of low-cost RFID systems that promised a
low-cost link between physical goods and networked information environments.
Since then, advances in blockchain, Web3, and artificial intelligence have
introduced unprecedented levels of resilience, consensus, and autonomy. By
leveraging decentralised identity, blockchain-based product information and
history, and intelligent AI-to-AI collaboration, this paper examines these
developments and outlines a new specification for the Intelligent Product 3.0,
illustrating how decentralised and AI-driven capabilities facilitate seamless
interaction between physical AI and everyday products.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型（LLMs）在电信等专业领域的实际应用中表现不佳，需要针对性优化以满足高精度需求。

Method: 采用Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA)技术，结合10万条电信领域样本数据对TSLAM-Mini进行微调，并通过自动化评估框架验证性能。

Result: 微调后的TSLAM-Mini在电信应用中表现优异，证明了领域专属数据和高效微调方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过领域专属数据和参数高效微调技术，可以显著提升小型语言模型在专业任务中的表现，为智能网络管理提供新思路。

Abstract: General-purpose large language models (LLMs), despite their broad
capabilities accrued from open-world data, frequently exhibit suboptimal
performance when confronted with the nuanced and specialized demands inherent
in real-time telecommunications applications. This investigation addresses this
critical limitation through the meticulous fine-tuning of TSLAM-Mini developed
by NetoAI, a compact (3.8-billion parameter) causal language model
architecturally derived from Phi-4 Mini Instruct 4B. The fine-tuning regimen
leverages a bespoke dataset comprising 100,000 samples, strategically
engineered to address 20 pivotal telecommunications use-cases, encompassing
domains such as Network Fundamentals, IP Routing, MPLS, Network Security,
Automation, OSS/BSS, RAN, Mobile Core, Satellite Communications, and Ethical
AI. This dataset was curated utilizing NetoAI's DigiTwin platform, enriched
with granular insights from venerated network Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and
authoritative RFC documents, thereby capturing high-fidelity representations of
real-world network dynamics through simulations inspired by digital twin
paradigms. Employing Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), a state-of-the-art
Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) technique, we achieved substantial
training efficiency and enabled prospective deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. A novel evaluation framework, predicated on a high-capacity LLM
(Qwen3-235B-A22B) functioning as an automated adjudicator, was instituted to
rigorously assess instruction-following fidelity and response quality across
the specified telecom use-cases. Empirical results unequivocally demonstrate
TSLAM-Mini's superior aptitude in telecom-centric applications, underscoring
the profound efficacy of domain-specific datasets and PEFT methodologies for
advancing intelligent network management.

Abstract: Advanced fifth generation (5G) and beyond (B5G) communication networks have
revolutionized wireless technologies, supporting ultra-high data rates, low
latency, and massive connectivity. However, they also introduce
vulnerabilities, particularly in decentralized Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT) environments. Traditional cryptographic methods struggle with
scalability and complexity, leading researchers to explore Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-driven physical layer techniques for secure communications.
In this context, this paper focuses on the utilization of Machine and Deep
Learning (ML/DL) techniques to tackle with the common problem of eavesdropping
detection. To this end, a simulated industrial B5G heterogeneous wireless
network is used to evaluate the performance of various ML/DL models, including
Random Forests (RF), Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models classify users as either
legitimate or malicious ones based on channel state information (CSI), position
data, and transmission power. According to the presented numerical results,
DCNN and RF models achieve a detection accuracy approaching 100\% in
identifying eavesdroppers with zero false alarms. In general, this work
underlines the great potential of combining AI and Physical Layer Security
(PLS) for next-generation wireless networks in order to address evolving
security threats.

Abstract: The proliferation of intelligent applications at the wireless edge, alongside
the exponential growth of multimodal data, poses challenges for deploying
multimodal large models (MLMs) in resource-constrained networks. These
constraints manifest as limited bandwidth, computational capacity, and
stringent latency requirements, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a token
communication paradigm that facilitates the decentralized deployment of MLMs
across user devices and edge infrastructure (e.g., base stations). In this
paradigm, task-relevant tokens are extracted from multimodal inputs and serve
as the primary medium for communication between distributed model components.
To align semantics and optimize transmission efficiency, we propose a
dual-pronged approach: 1) We design a contrastive split fine-tuning method to
project heterogeneous modalities into a shared feature space, enabling seamless
interaction between model components while preserving modal-specific semantics.
2) We employ a lightweight compression technique to reduce the size of
transmitted tokens, minimizing bandwidth consumption without sacrificing
task-critical information. The proposed framework integrates collaborative
fine-tuning of both the foundation model and multimodal transceivers, ensuring
that token generation and utilization are tailored to specific downstream
tasks. Simulation experiments conducted under different SNR conditions
demonstrate that our method results in a $13.7\%$ improvement in test accuracy.
Furthermore, our approach exhibits quicker convergence rates, even with reduced
token lengths, highlighting the promise of token communication for facilitating
more scalable and resilient MLM implementations in practical multiuser
networks.

Abstract: The vision of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks paves the way for the
seamless integration of digital twins into vehicular networks, giving rise to a
Vehicular Digital Twin Network (VDTN). The large amount of computing resources

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于实际传感节点和测试车辆的成本限制，现有的信道指纹（CF）通常为粗粒度，无法满足无线收发器设计需求，因此需要一种方法将粗粒度CF转化为高精度的细粒度CF。

Method: 使用条件生成扩散模型（CGDM）作为核心计算框架，结合变分推断技术，通过学习目标数据的复杂分布，将粗粒度CF作为辅助信息引导细粒度CF的生成。采用一次性剪枝策略和多目标知识蒸馏技术降低模型复杂度。

Conclusion: CGDM和CF双子方案有效解决了粗粒度CF到细粒度CF的转换问题，为智能环境感知通信提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition for massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is essential for future mobile
communication networks. Channel fingerprint (CF), also referred to as channel
knowledge map, is a key enabler for intelligent environment-aware communication
and can facilitate CSI acquisition. However, due to the cost limitations of
practical sensing nodes and test vehicles, the resulting CF is typically
coarse-grained, making it insufficient for wireless transceiver design. In this
work, we introduce the concept of CF twins and design a conditional generative
diffusion model (CGDM) with strong implicit prior learning capabilities as the
computational core of the CF twin to establish the connection between coarse-
and fine-grained CFs. Specifically, we employ a variational inference technique
to derive the evidence lower bound (ELBO) for the log-marginal distribution of
the observed fine-grained CF conditioned on the coarse-grained CF, enabling the
CGDM to learn the complicated distribution of the target data. During the
denoising neural network optimization, the coarse-grained CF is introduced as
side information to accurately guide the conditioned generation of the CGDM. To
make the proposed CGDM lightweight, we further leverage the additivity of
network layers and introduce a one-shot pruning approach along with a
multi-objective knowledge distillation technique. Experimental results show
that the proposed approach exhibits significant improvement in reconstruction
performance compared to the baselines. Additionally, zero-shot testing on
reconstruction tasks with different magnification factors further demonstrates
the scalability and generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Result: 实验结果表明，CDiff方法在EnvCF构建上的性能显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CDiff通过深度条件生成学习有效提升了环境感知通信中细粒度信息重构的能力，为未来无线通信设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The paradigm shift from environment-unaware communication to intelligent
environment-aware communication is expected to facilitate the acquisition of
channel state information for future wireless communications. Channel
Fingerprint (CF), as an emerging enabling technology for environment-aware
communication, provides channel-related knowledge for potential locations
within the target communication area. However, due to the limited availability
of practical devices for sensing environmental information and measuring
channel-related knowledge, most of the acquired environmental information and
CF are coarse-grained, insufficient to guide the design of wireless
transmissions. To address this, this paper proposes a deep conditional
generative learning approach, namely a customized conditional generative
diffusion model (CDiff). The proposed CDiff simultaneously refines
environmental information and CF, reconstructing a fine-grained CF that
incorporates environmental information, referred to as EnvCF, from its
coarse-grained counterpart. Experimental results show that the proposed
approach significantly improves the performance of EnvCF construction compared
to the baselines.

Motivation: 解决多智能体在复杂动态环境中的路径规划问题，尤其是在去中心化且通信受限的场景下，如何高效协作并避免冲突和死锁。

Method: 采用快速通信策略，通过信息包交换运动约束信息，增强协作路径规划和情境感知。算法确保在可能的情况下解决和避免所有死锁情况。

Result: 在5种环境和25个随机场景中测试，PRISM支持比CBS多3.4倍的智能体，在狭窄通道环境中比TPTS多处理2.5倍的任务，同时在低连接条件下与CBS求解质量相当且计算更快。

Conclusion: PRISM展现出在复杂动态路径规划场景中的鲁棒性、扩展性和高效性，适用于大规模环境。

Abstract: We introduce PRISM (Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion
Constraints), a decentralized algorithm designed to address the multi-task
multi-agent pathfinding (MT-MAPF) problem. PRISM enables large teams of agents
to concurrently plan safe and efficient paths for multiple tasks while avoiding
collisions. It employs a rapid communication strategy that uses information
packets to exchange motion constraint information, enhancing cooperative
pathfinding and situational awareness, even in scenarios without direct
communication. We prove that PRISM resolves and avoids all deadlock scenarios
when possible, a critical challenge in decentralized pathfinding. Empirically,
we evaluate PRISM across five environments and 25 random scenarios,
benchmarking it against the centralized Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and the
decentralized Token Passing with Task Swaps (TPTS) algorithms. PRISM
demonstrates scalability and solution quality, supporting 3.4 times more agents
than CBS and handling up to 2.5 times more tasks in narrow passage environments
than TPTS. Additionally, PRISM matches CBS in solution quality while achieving
faster computation times, even under low-connectivity conditions. Its
decentralized design reduces the computational burden on individual agents,
making it scalable for large environments. These results confirm PRISM's
robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in complex and dynamic pathfinding
scenarios.

Abstract: The ability to learn from large batches of autonomously collected data for
policy improvement -- a paradigm we refer to as batch online reinforcement
learning -- holds the promise of enabling truly scalable robot learning by
significantly reducing the need for human effort of data collection while
getting benefits from self-improvement. Yet, despite the promise of this
paradigm, it remains challenging to achieve due to algorithms not being able to
learn effectively from the autonomous data. For example, prior works have
applied imitation learning and filtered imitation learning methods to the batch
online RL problem, but these algorithms often fail to efficiently improve from
the autonomously collected data or converge quickly to a suboptimal point. This
raises the question of what matters for effective batch online RL in robotics.
Motivated by this question, we perform a systematic empirical study of three
axes -- (i) algorithm class, (ii) policy extraction methods, and (iii) policy
expressivity -- and analyze how these axes affect performance and scaling with
the amount of autonomous data. Through our analysis, we make several
observations. First, we observe that the use of Q-functions to guide batch
online RL significantly improves performance over imitation-based methods.
Building on this, we show that an implicit method of policy extraction -- via
choosing the best action in the distribution of the policy -- is necessary over
traditional policy extraction methods from offline RL. Next, we show that an
expressive policy class is preferred over less expressive policy classes. Based
on this analysis, we propose a general recipe for effective batch online RL. We
then show a simple addition to the recipe of using temporally-correlated noise
to obtain more diversity results in further performance gains. Our recipe
obtains significantly better performance and scaling compared to prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主车辆（AV）在科学任务（如水下跟踪）中具有成本效益，但多智能体强化学习（MARL）在扩展至车队控制时面临计算效率低下的挑战。高保真仿真器（如Gazebo）在多车场景下无法显著加速训练，导致MARL训练不切实际。

Conclusion: 研究填补了大规模MARL训练与高保真部署之间的差距，为现实海上任务中的自主车队控制提供了可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AV) offer a cost-effective solution for scientific
missions such as underwater tracking. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has
emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine
environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for
multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents
significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like
Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations,
they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL
training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative
distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified,
GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach
achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling
efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce
a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent
policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving
sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely
on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our
method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even
in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets. This work bridges the gap
between large-scale MARL training and high-fidelity deployment, providing a
scalable framework for autonomous fleet control in real-world sea missions.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown the great potential of diffusion models in
improving reinforcement learning (RL) by modeling complex policies, expressing
a high degree of multi-modality, and efficiently handling high-dimensional
continuous control tasks. However, there is currently limited research on how
to optimize diffusion-based polices (e.g., Diffusion Policy) fast and stably.
In this paper, we propose an Adam-based Diffusion Policy Optimization (ADPO), a
fast algorithmic framework containing best practices for fine-tuning
diffusion-based polices in robotic control tasks using the adaptive gradient
descent method in RL. Adaptive gradient method is less studied in training RL,
let alone diffusion-based policies. We confirm that ADPO outperforms other
diffusion-based RL methods in terms of overall effectiveness for fine-tuning on
standard robotic tasks. Concretely, we conduct extensive experiments on
standard robotic control tasks to test ADPO, where, particularly, six popular
diffusion-based RL methods are provided as benchmark methods. Experimental
results show that ADPO acquires better or comparable performance than the
baseline methods. Finally, we systematically analyze the sensitivity of
multiple hyperparameters in standard robotics tasks, providing guidance for
subsequent practical applications. Our video demonstrations are released in

Abstract: Multirotors play a significant role in diverse field robotics applications
but remain highly susceptible to actuator failures, leading to rapid
instability and compromised mission reliability. While various fault-tolerant
control (FTC) strategies using reinforcement learning (RL) have been widely
explored, most previous approaches require prior knowledge of the multirotor
model or struggle to adapt to new configurations. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel hybrid RL-based FTC framework integrated with a
transformer-based online adaptation module. Our framework leverages a
transformer architecture to infer latent representations in real time, enabling
adaptation to previously unseen system models without retraining. We evaluate
our method in a PyBullet simulation under loss-of-effectiveness actuator
faults, achieving a 95% success rate and a positional root mean square error
(RMSE) of 0.129 m, outperforming existing adaptation methods with 86% success
and an RMSE of 0.153 m. Further evaluations on quadrotors with varying
configurations confirm the robustness of our framework across untrained
dynamics. These results demonstrate the potential of our framework to enhance
the adaptability and reliability of multirotors, enabling efficient fault
management in dynamic and uncertain environments. Website is available at

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is critical for

B\'ezier curves. We train a reinforcement learning agent using an
action-mapping-based Soft Actor-Critic (AM-SAC) algorithm employing a
self-adaptive curriculum. Experiments on both procedurally generated and
hand-crafted scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning
energy-efficient coverage strategies.

Conclusion: 论文提出了改进因果好奇心方法的建议，以更好地应对现实世界中的复杂场景。

Abstract: Causal understanding is important in many disciplines of science and
engineering, where we seek to understand how different factors in the system
causally affect an experiment or situation and pave a pathway towards creating
effective or optimising existing models. Examples of use cases are autonomous
exploration and modelling of unknown environments or assessing key variables in
optimising large complex systems. In this paper, we analyse a Reinforcement
Learning approach called Causal Curiosity, which aims to estimate as accurately
and efficiently as possible, without directly measuring them, the value of
factors that causally determine the dynamics of a system. Whilst the idea
presents a pathway forward, measurement accuracy is the foundation of
methodology effectiveness. Focusing on the current causal curiosity's robotic
manipulator, we present for the first time a measurement accuracy analysis of
the future potentials and current limitations of this technique and an analysis
of its sensitivity and confounding factor disentanglement capability - crucial
for causal analysis. As a result of our work, we promote proposals for an
improved and efficient design of Causal Curiosity methods to be applied to
real-world complex scenarios.

Conclusion: 自动课程学习能显著增强基于强化学习的自动驾驶代理的鲁棒性和训练效率。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving
agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a
fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in
simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While
domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving
scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal
policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that
dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the
agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that
introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a
``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on
their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's
current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework
enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or
finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning
setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative
results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain
randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization,
achieving higher success rates: +9\% in low traffic density, +21\% in high
traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings
highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of
RL-based autonomous driving agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FSD的新型视觉语言模型，通过空间关系推理生成中间表示，用于机器人操作的细粒度指导，显著提升了零样本任务和真实场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言-动作模型在未见过场景和新任务中零样本性能不足的问题，主要由于实体数据集的稀缺性和异质性，需要更有效的空间推理和表示方法。

Method: 提出FSD模型，采用分层数据训练流程和自一致性机制，对齐视觉信号与空间坐标，通过空间关系推理生成中间表示。

Result: FSD在8个通用空间推理和实体基准测试中表现优异，并在VABench更具挑战性的基准测试中验证了其能力。在零样本机器人操作中，FSD在SimperEnv和现实机器人任务中的成功率分别为54.1%和72%，比基线方法提升了30%。

Conclusion: FSD通过空间关系推理显著提升了机器人操作的零样本性能，展示了其在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical
challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot
performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied
datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing),
a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations
through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for
robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for
training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with
visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated
FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding
performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied
reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark
VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation,
demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in
both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD
achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8
real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人机协作（HRC）中，准确识别人类活动对机器人响应至关重要。现有系统通常仅依赖单一模态数据（如运动或触觉），但多模态数据可能提供更全面的信息。

Method: 研究比较了三种方法：基于IMU数据的运动分类（MBC）、基于触觉传感器的单/双视频流分类（TBC），以及结合两者的多模态分类（MMC）。通过离线和在线验证评估性能。

Result: 多模态方法在精确度和鲁棒性上均优于单模态方法，尤其在连续动作序列中表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 触觉与运动数据的结合显著提升了HAR系统性能，展示了多模态传感在协作机器人中的潜力。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for effective Human-Robot
Collaboration (HRC), enabling robots to interpret and respond to human actions.
This study evaluates the ability of a vision-based tactile sensor to classify
15 activities, comparing its performance to an IMU-based data glove.
Additionally, we propose a multi-modal framework combining tactile and motion
data to leverage their complementary strengths. We examined three approaches:
motion-based classification (MBC) using IMU data, tactile-based classification
(TBC) with single or dual video streams, and multi-modal classification (MMC)
integrating both. Offline validation on segmented datasets assessed each
configuration's accuracy under controlled conditions, while online validation
on continuous action sequences tested online performance. Results showed the
multi-modal approach consistently outperformed single-modality methods,
highlighting the potential of integrating tactile and motion sensing to enhance
HAR systems for collaborative robotics.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用内部语音机制增强社交机器人在饮食建议中的透明度和信任度，通过显式化推理过程提升人机交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗场景中，用户对机器人助手的信任依赖于准确的建议和自然对话，内部语音能结构化思维过程，提升解释性。

Method: 开发了具有内部语音功能的社交机器人，结合大语言模型和知识图谱，验证用户输入、优化推理并生成清晰解释。

Result: 方法提高了决策透明性，用户实验验证了内部语音在解释机器人行为时的可靠性及架构的计算效率。

Conclusion: 内部语音显著增强了人机信任，尤其在医疗领域，透明化推理是关键。

Abstract: We explore the use of inner speech as a mechanism to enhance transparency and
trust in social robots for dietary advice. In humans, inner speech structures
thought processes and decision-making; in robotics, it improves explainability
by making reasoning explicit. This is crucial in healthcare scenarios, where
trust in robotic assistants depends on both accurate recommendations and
human-like dialogue, which make interactions more natural and engaging.
Building on this, we developed a social robot that provides dietary advice, and
we provided the architecture with inner speech capabilities to validate user
input, refine reasoning, and generate clear justifications. The system
integrates large language models for natural language understanding and a
knowledge graph for structured dietary information. By making decisions more
transparent, our approach strengthens trust and improves human-robot
interaction in healthcare. We validated this by measuring the computational
efficiency of our architecture and conducting a small user study, which
assessed the reliability of inner speech in explaining the robot's behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents a modified model predictive control (MPC) framework for
real-time power system operation. The framework incorporates a diffusion model
tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load
forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit
state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive
the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a
renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park
system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to
augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy,
and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation

TL;DR: PosterO利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的布局知识，通过树形SVG结构和意图对齐的示例选择生成多样化海报布局，在有限数据下实现最新性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略布局多样性且无法应对形状多变元素或多样化设计意图，因此提出一种布局中心的方法。

Method: 通过通用形状、设计意图向量化和层次节点表示构建SVG树形结构，利用LLMs推理预测新布局树。

Result: PosterO能生成视觉吸引的布局，在多个基准测试中达到最新性能，并建立了PStylish7数据集验证泛化能力。

Conclusion: PosterO为多样化目的生成高质量海报布局，推动相关研究。

Abstract: In poster design, content-aware layout generation is crucial for
automatically arranging visual-textual elements on the given image. With
limited training data, existing work focused on image-centric enhancement.
However, this neglects the diversity of layouts and fails to cope with
shape-variant elements or diverse design intents in generalized settings. To
this end, we proposed a layout-centric approach that leverages layout knowledge
implicit in large language models (LLMs) to create posters for omnifarious
purposes, hence the name PosterO. Specifically, it structures layouts from
datasets as trees in SVG language by universal shape, design intent
vectorization, and hierarchical node representation. Then, it applies LLMs
during inference to predict new layout trees by in-context learning with
intent-aligned example selection. After layout trees are generated, we can
seamlessly realize them into poster designs by editing the chat with LLMs.
Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that PosterO can generate
visually appealing layouts for given images, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance across various benchmarks. To further explore PosterO's abilities
under the generalized settings, we built PStylish7, the first dataset with
multi-purpose posters and various-shaped elements, further offering a
challenging test for advanced research.

Motivation: 现有系统因手势标记的固定粒度无法建模不同手势模式的多变粒度（即完成一个完整表达手势所需的帧数），导致生成效果受限。

Method: 提出M3G框架，包含MGVQ-VAE用于多粒度运动模式标记与重建，以及多粒度标记预测器从音频提取信息并预测运动标记。

Result: 实验表明，M3G在生成自然且富有表现力的全身手势方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: M3G通过建模手势的多粒度特性，显著提升了音频驱动手势生成的质量和表现力。

Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures encompassing face, body, hands, and
global movements from audio is a valuable yet challenging task in virtual
avatar creation. Previous systems focused on tokenizing the human gestures
framewisely and predicting the tokens of each frame from the input audio.
However, one observation is that the number of frames required for a complete
expressive human gesture, defined as granularity, varies among different human
gesture patterns. Existing systems fail to model these gesture patterns due to
the fixed granularity of their gesture tokens. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel framework named Multi-Granular Gesture Generator (M3G) for
audio-driven holistic gesture generation. In M3G, we propose a novel
Multi-Granular VQ-VAE (MGVQ-VAE) to tokenize motion patterns and reconstruct
motion sequences from different temporal granularities. Subsequently, we
proposed a multi-granular token predictor that extracts multi-granular
information from audio and predicts the corresponding motion tokens. Then M3G
reconstructs the human gestures from the predicted tokens using the MGVQ-VAE.
Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3G
framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generating
natural and expressive full-body human gestures.

Motivation: 传统CAD设计依赖专家手动绘制或修改现有库文件，难以实现快速个性化。尽管生成式AI为个性化CAD生成提供了可能，但现有方法生成的输出缺乏交互编辑性和几何标注，限制了其在制造中的实际应用。

Method: 论文提出了CAD-Coder框架，通过将自然语言指令转换为可执行的CAD脚本代码（Python环境），生成可编辑的CAD文件（.Dxf）。同时构建了一个包含29,130个Dxf文件及其对应脚本代码的数据集，确保生成的草图兼具编辑性和几何标注。

Result: 在多种2D/3D CAD生成任务中，CAD-Coder展示了优于现有方法的交互能力，并能够生成带有几何标注的可编辑草图。

Conclusion: CAD-Coder为CAD设计提供了一种高效的交互式生成方法，解决了现有方法在编辑性和标注信息保留上的不足，具有较高的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is a way to digitally create 2D drawings and 3D
models of real-world products. Traditional CAD typically relies on hand-drawing
by experts or modifications of existing library files, which doesn't allow for
rapid personalization. With the emergence of generative artificial
intelligence, convenient and efficient personalized CAD generation has become
possible. However, existing generative methods typically produce outputs that
lack interactive editability and geometric annotations, limiting their
practical applications in manufacturing. To enable interactive generative CAD,
we propose CAD-Coder, a framework that transforms natural language instructions
into CAD script codes, which can be executed in Python environments to generate
human-editable CAD files (.Dxf). To facilitate the generation of editable CAD
sketches with annotation information, we construct a comprehensive dataset
comprising 29,130 Dxf files with their corresponding script codes, where each
sketch preserves both editability and geometric annotations. We evaluate
CAD-Coder on various 2D/3D CAD generation tasks against existing methods,
demonstrating superior interactive capabilities while uniquely providing
editable sketches with geometric annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOFs的设计空间巨大但传统方法难以应对，生成模型虽具潜力但受限于已知构建块或小单元胞。

Method: 采用SE(3)-equivariant扩散模型，学习3D全原子表示，并基于CoRE-MOF数据库训练。

Result: 模型能生成含1000原子的单元胞，几何有效性、新颖性和多样性接近实验数据库，并成功合成了一种预测的高分MOF。

Conclusion: BBA-Diff为合成高性能MOFs提供了可行路径，大幅扩展了可访问的化学空间。

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) marry inorganic nodes, organic edges, and
topological nets into programmable porous crystals, yet their astronomical
design space defies brute-force synthesis. Generative modeling holds ultimate
promise, but existing models either recycle known building blocks or are
restricted to small unit cells. We introduce Building-Block-Aware MOF Diffusion
(BBA MOF Diffusion), an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that learns 3D
all-atom representations of individual building blocks, encoding
crystallographic topological nets explicitly. Trained on the CoRE-MOF database,
BBA MOF Diffusion readily samples MOFs with unit cells containing 1000 atoms
with great geometric validity, novelty, and diversity mirroring experimental
databases. Its native building-block representation produces unprecedented
metal nodes and organic edges, expanding accessible chemical space by orders of
magnitude. One high-scoring [Zn(1,4-TDC)(EtOH)2] MOF predicted by the model was
synthesized, where powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2
sorption confirm its structural fidelity. BBA-Diff thus furnishes a practical
pathway to synthesizable and high-performing MOFs.

Motivation: 现有研究未系统评估LLMs在语言驱动的单细胞分析任务中的表现，CellVerse填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建CellVerse基准，整合四种单细胞多组学数据，涵盖三个层次的分析任务，并评估14种开源与闭源LLMs的表现。

Result: 发现专业模型表现不佳，通用模型初步具备理解能力，但整体性能远低于预期，尤其在药物反应预测任务中表现接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: LLMs在细胞生物学应用中仍面临巨大挑战，CellVerse为基于自然语言的下一代单细胞分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of modeling single-cell data
as natural languages and the potential of leveraging powerful large language
models (LLMs) for understanding cell biology. However, a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on language-driven single-cell analysis tasks
still remains unexplored. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse,
a unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four
types of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels
of single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response
prediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond
this, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and
closed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse. Remarkably, the
experimental results reveal: (1) Existing specialist models (C2S-Pythia) fail
to make reasonable decisions across all sub-tasks within CellVerse, while
generalist models such as Qwen, Llama, GPT, and DeepSeek family models exhibit
preliminary understanding capabilities within the realm of cell biology. (2)
The performance of current LLMs falls short of expectations and has substantial
room for improvement. Notably, in the widely studied drug response prediction
task, none of the evaluated LLMs demonstrate significant performance
improvement over random guessing. CellVerse offers the first large-scale
empirical demonstration that significant challenges still remain in applying
LLMs to cell biology. By introducing CellVerse, we lay the foundation for
advancing cell biology through natural languages and hope this paradigm could
facilitate next-generation single-cell analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单分子荧光数据分析依赖于人工和经验，难以扩展和复现。现有深度学习方法仍需要手动阈值或大量标注数据，限制了实用性。

Method: 提出DASH架构，实现自动化迹线分类、状态分配和排序，无需人工干预。以Cas12a介导的DNA切割为例验证。

Result: DASH在不同用户和实验条件下表现稳健，适用于平衡和非平衡系统。

Conclusion: DASH为单分子水平生物动力学研究提供了高效、自动化的分析工具。

Abstract: Single-molecule fluorescence assays enable high-resolution analysis of
biomolecular dynamics, but traditional analysis pipelines are labor-intensive
and rely on users' experience, limiting scalability and reproducibility. Recent
deep learning models have automated aspects of data processing, yet many still
require manual thresholds, complex architectures, or extensive labeled data.
Therefore, we present DASH, a fully streamlined architecture for trace
classification, state assignment, and automatic sorting that requires no user
input. DASH demonstrates robust performance across users and experimental
conditions both in equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems such as
Cas12a-mediated DNA cleavage. This paper proposes a novel strategy for the
automatic and detailed sorting of single-molecule fluorescence events. The
dynamic cleavage process of Cas12a is used as an example to provide a
comprehensive analysis. This approach is crucial for studying biokinetic
structural changes at the single-molecule level.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding and integrating more into
daily life to automate tasks, guide decision making, and enhance efficiency.
However, complex AI models, which make decisions without providing clear
explanations (known as the "black-box problem"), currently restrict trust and
widespread adoption of AI. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has
emerged to address the black-box problem of making AI systems more
interpretable and transparent so stakeholders can trust, verify, and act upon
AI-based outcomes. Researchers have developed various techniques to foster XAI
in the Software Development Lifecycle. However, there are gaps in applying XAI
techniques in the Software Engineering phases. Literature review shows that 68%
of XAI in Software Engineering research is focused on maintenance as opposed to
8% on software management and requirements. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey of the applications of XAI methods such as concept-based
explanations, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), rule extraction, attention mechanisms,
counterfactual explanations, and example-based explanations to the different
phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including requirements
elicitation, design and development, testing and deployment, and evolution. To
the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey
of XAI techniques for every phase of the Software Development Life Cycle
(SDLC). This survey aims to promote explainable AI in Software Engineering and

TL;DR: SweRank：一种高效的检索-重排序框架，用于软件问题定位，基于大规模数据集SweLoc。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理方法成本高且延迟大，传统代码排序模型难以处理复杂问题描述，需更高效的方案。

Method: 提出SweRank框架（检索-重排序），并基于公开GitHub仓库构建SweLoc数据集用于训练。

Result: 在SWE-Bench-Lite和LocBench上实现SOTA性能，优于传统模型和基于封闭LLM的系统。

Conclusion: SweRank高效且有效，SweLoc数据集可提升现有模型，为社区提供宝贵资源。

Abstract: Software issue localization, the task of identifying the precise code
locations (files, classes, or functions) relevant to a natural language issue
description (e.g., bug report, feature request), is a critical yet
time-consuming aspect of software development. While recent LLM-based agentic
approaches demonstrate promise, they often incur significant latency and cost
due to complex multi-step reasoning and relying on closed-source LLMs.
Alternatively, traditional code ranking models, typically optimized for
query-to-code or code-to-code retrieval, struggle with the verbose and
failure-descriptive nature of issue localization queries. To bridge this gap,
we introduce SweRank, an efficient and effective retrieve-and-rerank framework
for software issue localization. To facilitate training, we construct SweLoc, a
large-scale dataset curated from public GitHub repositories, featuring
real-world issue descriptions paired with corresponding code modifications.
Empirical results on SWE-Bench-Lite and LocBench show that SweRank achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both prior ranking models and
costly agent-based systems using closed-source LLMs like Claude-3.5. Further,
we demonstrate SweLoc's utility in enhancing various existing retriever and
reranker models for issue localization, establishing the dataset as a valuable
resource for the community.

Abstract: This study conducts a Quantitative Structure Property Relationship (QSPR)
analysis to explore the correlation between the physical properties of drug
molecules and their topological indices using machine learning techniques.
While prior studies in drug design have focused on degree-based topological
indices, this work analyzes a dataset of 166 drug molecules by computing
degree-distance-based topological indices, incorporating vertex-edge weightings
with respect to different six atomic properties (atomic number, atomic radius,
atomic mass, density, electronegativity, ionization). Both linear models
(Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge Regression) and nonlinear approaches
(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks) were employed to predict
molecular properties. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these
indices in predicting specific physicochemical properties and underscore the
practical relevance of computational methods in molecular property estimation.
The study provides an innovative perspective on integrating topological indices
with machine learning to enhance predictive accuracy, highlighting their
potential application in drug discovery and development processes. This
predictive may also explain that establishing a reliable relationship between
topological indices and physical properties enables chemists to gain
preliminary insights into molecular behavior before conducting experimental
analyses, thereby optimizing resource utilization in cheminformatics research.

Abstract: Synthesizability in small molecule generative design remains a bottleneck.
Existing works that do consider synthesizability can output predicted synthesis
routes for generated molecules. However, there has been minimal attention in
addressing the ease of synthesis and enabling flexibility to incorporate
desired reaction constraints. In this work, we propose a small molecule
generative design framework that enables steerable and granular
synthesizability control. Generated molecules satisfy arbitrary multi-parameter
optimization objectives with predicted synthesis routes containing pre-defined
allowed reactions, while optionally avoiding others. One can also enforce that
all reactions belong to a pre-defined set. We show the capability to
mix-and-match these reaction constraints across the most common medicinal
chemistry transformations. Next, we show how our framework can be used to
valorize industrial byproducts towards de novo optimized molecules. Going
further, we demonstrate how granular control over synthesizability constraints
can loosely mimic virtual screening of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries.
Using only a single GPU, we generate and dock 15k molecules to identify
promising candidates in Freedom 4.0 constituting 142B make-on-demand molecules
(assessing only 0.00001% of the library). Generated molecules satisfying the
reaction constraints have > 90% exact match rate. Lastly, we benchmark our
framework against recent synthesizability-constrained generative models and
demonstrate the highest sample efficiency even when imposing the additional
constraint that all molecules must be synthesizable from a single reaction
type. The main theme is demonstrating that a pre-trained generalist molecular
generative model can be incentivized to generate property-optimized small
molecules under challenging synthesizability constraints through reinforcement
learning.

TL;DR: 论文使用可解释机器学习分析银河系外围低金属丰度分子云的分子线比率，发现温度、密度及初始碳丰度是关键影响因素，CN/HCN和HNC/HCN比率对碳丰度敏感，CS/SO对氧丰度敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究银河系外围低金属丰度区域的分子云化学和物理特性，通过分子线比率理解碳氧化学与物理环境的关联。

Method: 结合UCLCHEM生成的大规模天体化学模型网格，采用经典分析和可解释机器学习（SHAP和UMAP）方法。

Result: 温度、密度是主要影响因素，碳氧丰度在部分参数空间中也起关键作用；UMAP可有效分组不同比率类型。

Conclusion: 所选分子线比率主要对碳初始丰度、温度和密度敏感，其中CN/HCN和HNC/HCN是碳丰度的理想探针，仅CS/SO对氧丰度敏感。

Abstract: Context. The outer Milky Way has a lower metallicity than our solar
neighbourhood, but still many molecules are detected in the region. Molecular
line ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics
in these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9
different molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection
between the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen
chemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated
using UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and
carbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a
classical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning,
namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order
dependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction
method to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the
parameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate
all input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are
the most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important
in parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different
types of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly
sensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the
temperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to
be sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for
this parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen
abundance.

Abstract: The convergence of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the
emergence of AI-based tokens, which are cryptographic assets designed to power
decentralized AI platforms and services. This paper provides a comprehensive
review of leading AI-token projects, examining their technical architectures,
token utilities, consensus mechanisms, and underlying business models. We
explore how these tokens operate across various blockchain ecosystems and
assess the extent to which they offer value beyond traditional centralized AI
services. Based on this assessment, our analysis identifies several core
limitations. From a technical perspective, many platforms depend extensively on
off-chain computation, exhibit limited capabilities for on-chain intelligence,
and encounter significant scalability challenges. From a business perspective,
many models appear to replicate centralized AI service structures, simply
adding token-based payment and governance layers without delivering truly novel
value. In light of these challenges, we also examine emerging developments that
may shape the next phase of decentralized AI systems. These include approaches
for on-chain verification of AI outputs, blockchain-enabled federated learning,
and more robust incentive frameworks. Collectively, while emerging innovations
offer pathways to strengthen decentralized AI ecosystems, significant gaps
remain between the promises and the realities of current AI-token
implementations. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research at the
intersection of AI and blockchain, highlighting the need for critical
evaluation and more grounded approaches as the field continues to evolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统因异构计算管道（LLM、数据库等）面临效率挑战，需高效部署方案。

Method: 提出Patchwork框架，含灵活接口、分布式优化及在线调度机制，动态优化资源与请求优先级。

Result: 在四种RAG实现中，吞吐量提升48%，SLO违规减少24%。

Conclusion: Patchwork显著提升RAG系统性能，为异构计算管道提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a new paradigm for
enhancing Large Language Model reliability through integration with external
knowledge sources. However, efficient deployment of these systems presents
significant technical challenges due to their inherently heterogeneous
computational pipelines comprising LLMs, databases, and specialized processing
components. We introduce Patchwork, a comprehensive end-to-end RAG serving
framework designed to address these efficiency bottlenecks. Patchwork's
architecture offers three key innovations: First, it provides a flexible
specification interface enabling users to implement custom RAG pipelines.
Secondly, it deploys these pipelines as distributed inference systems while
optimizing for the unique scalability characteristics of individual RAG
components. Third, Patchwork incorporates an online scheduling mechanism that
continuously monitors request load and execution progress, dynamically
minimizing SLO violations through strategic request prioritization and resource
auto-scaling. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct RAG
implementations demonstrates that Patchwork delivers substantial performance
improvements over commercial alternatives, achieving throughput gains exceeding
48% while simultaneously reducing SLO violations by ~24%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏注意力计算模式（3S）在GPU上执行效率低，因（a）稀疏性与张量核心不匹配，（b）数据移动成本高。以往工作仅优化单个操作或部分挑战，需整体解决方案。

Method: 提出Fused3S算法，首次融合SDDMM、softmax和SpMM三个操作，协同优化张量核心利用与数据移动。

Result: 在真实图数据集上，Fused3S在H100/A30 GPU分别提速1.6-16.3倍和1.5-14倍；集成到图Transformer推理后，端到端性能提升1.05-5.36倍。

Conclusion: Fused3S通过融合与协同优化显著提升3S计算效率，适用于多种GPU架构和图数据场景，远超现有基线方法。

Abstract: Sparse attention is a core building block in many leading neural network
models, from graph-structured learning to sparse sequence modeling. It can be
decomposed into a sequence of three sparse matrix operations (3S): sampled
dense-dense matrix multiplication (SDDMM), softmax normalization, and sparse
matrix multiplication (SpMM). Efficiently executing the 3S computational
pattern on modern GPUs remains challenging due to (a) the mismatch between
unstructured sparsity and tensor cores optimized for dense operations, and (b)
the high cost of data movement. Previous works have optimized these sparse
operations individually or addressed one of these challenges. This paper
introduces Fused3S, the first fused 3S algorithm that jointly maximizes tensor
core utilization and minimizes data movement. Across real-world graph datasets,
Fused3S achieves $1.6- 16.3\times$ and $1.5-14\times$ speedup over
state-of-the-art on H100 and A30 GPUs. Furthermore, integrating Fused3S into
Graph Transformer inference accelerates end-to-end performance by
$1.05-5.36\times$, consistently outperforming all 3S baselines across diverse
datasets (single and batched graphs) and GPU architectures.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，时变的DC偏移和相位不平衡会严重影响解调性能，需要一种更稳健的方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 通过从信号的相邻峰谷估计时变DC偏移，并结合I/Q通道信号的差分形式和希尔伯特变换来提取生命体征信息。

Result: 仿真和实验结果表明，该方法在低信噪比下仍能保持稳健性能，比现有技术更准确地恢复信号并抑制噪声干扰。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境下能有效提升生命体征检测的准确性和抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Accurate phase demodulation is critical for vital sign detection using
millimeter-wave radar. However, in complex environments, time-varying DC
offsets and phase imbalances can severely degrade demodulation performance. To
address this, we propose a novel DC offset calibration method alongside a
Hilbert and Differential Cross-Multiply (HADCM) demodulation algorithm. The
approach estimates time-varying DC offsets from neighboring signal peaks and
valleys, then employs both differential forms and Hilbert transforms of the I/Q
channel signals to extract vital sign information. Simulation and experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains robust performance under
low signal-to-noise ratios. Compared to existing demodulation techniques, it
offers more accurate signal recovery in challenging scenarios and effectively
suppresses noise interference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保AI系统公平性是一个复杂的社会技术挑战，需要在整个系统生命周期中进行细致治理和持续监督。

Result: 通过金融领域的案例研究，验证了框架在支持公平性论证方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI系统的动态公平性保证提供了可操作的方法，工具支持使其更具实用性。

Abstract: It is well recognised that ensuring fair AI systems is a complex
sociotechnical challenge, which requires careful deliberation and continuous
oversight across all stages of a system's lifecycle, from defining requirements
to model deployment and deprovisioning. Dynamic argument-based assurance cases,
which present structured arguments supported by evidence, have emerged as a
systematic approach to evaluating and mitigating safety risks and hazards in
AI-enabled system development and have also been extended to deal with broader
normative goals such as fairness and explainability. This paper introduces a
systems-engineering-driven framework, supported by software tooling, to
operationalise a dynamic approach to argument-based assurance in two stages. In
the first stage, during the requirements planning phase, a multi-disciplinary
and multi-stakeholder team define goals and claims to be established (and
evidenced) by conducting a comprehensive fairness governance process. In the
second stage, a continuous monitoring interface gathers evidence from existing
artefacts (e.g. metrics from automated tests), such as model, data, and use
case documentation, to support these arguments dynamically. The framework's
effectiveness is demonstrated through an illustrative case study in finance,
with a focus on supporting fairness-related arguments.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在健康信息纠偏中的沟通风格，发现其与人类专家在说服策略、确定性表达和价值对齐上存在差异，但人类评测更偏好LLM生成内容的清晰性、完整性和说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在健康信息沟通中与人类风格的差异及其对阅读者信任的影响。

Method: 通过权威机构数据集生成LLM对健康错误信息的响应，并基于健康沟通理论的三个维度（信息特征、发送策略、接收者价值对齐）评估风格差异，辅以99位参与者的盲评。

Result: LLM内容在传统质量指标（如说服策略、价值对齐）上得分较低，但人类评测更倾向于LLM的清晰性和完整性。

Conclusion: LLM虽在传统指标上不足，但其结构化信息呈现方式更吸引读者，提示其在健康信息沟通中的潜在优势。

Abstract: With the wide adoption of large language models (LLMs) in information
assistance, it is essential to examine their alignment with human communication
styles and values. We situate this study within the context of fact-checking
health information, given the critical challenge of rectifying conceptions and
building trust. Recent studies have explored the potential of LLM for health
communication, but style differences between LLMs and human experts and
associated reader perceptions remain under-explored. In this light, our study
evaluates the communication styles of LLMs, focusing on how their explanations
differ from those of humans in three core components of health communication:
information, sender, and receiver. We compiled a dataset of 1498 health
misinformation explanations from authoritative fact-checking organizations and
generated LLM responses to inaccurate health information. Drawing from health
communication theory, we evaluate communication styles across three key
dimensions of information linguistic features, sender persuasive strategies,
and receiver value alignments. We further assessed human perceptions through a
blinded evaluation with 99 participants. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated
articles showed significantly lower scores in persuasive strategies, certainty
expressions, and alignment with social values and moral foundations. However,
human evaluation demonstrated a strong preference for LLM content, with over
60% responses favoring LLM articles for clarity, completeness, and
persuasiveness. Our results suggest that LLMs' structured approach to
presenting information may be more effective at engaging readers despite
scoring lower on traditional measures of quality in fact-checking and health
communication.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过计算模型分析古典波斯诗人之间的影响关系，揭示传统文学中未被充分关注的结构性重要人物，并为数字人文研究提供可扩展的方法。

Method: 使用Ganjoor语料库的严谨数据集，构建加权相似性矩阵和聚合图，通过中心性度量和Louvain社区检测算法分析诗人网络。

Result: 研究发现了一些在文学传统中结构关键但知名度较低的诗人和文学流派，为波斯文学研究提供了新的数据支持。

Conclusion: 该研究结合计算语言学和文学研究，提出了一个可解释且可扩展的诗歌传统模型，有助于数字人文领域的回顾性和前瞻性研究。

Abstract: This study formalizes a computational model to simulate classical Persian
poets' dynamics of influence through constructing a multi-dimensional
similarity network. Using a rigorously curated dataset based on Ganjoor's
corpus, we draw upon semantic, lexical, stylistic, thematic, and metrical
features to demarcate each poet's corpus. Each is contained within weighted
similarity matrices, which are then appended to generate an aggregate graph
showing poet-to-poet influence. Further network investigation is carried out to
identify key poets, style hubs, and bridging poets by calculating degree,
closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures. Further, for
typological insight, we use the Louvain community detection algorithm to
demarcate clusters of poets sharing both style and theme coherence, which
correspond closely to acknowledged schools of literature like Sabk-e Hindi,
Sabk-e Khorasani, and the Bazgasht-e Adabi phenomenon. Our findings provide a
new data-driven view of Persian literature distinguished between canonical
significance and interextual influence, thus highlighting relatively
lesser-known figures who hold great structural significance. Combining
computational linguistics with literary study, this paper produces an
interpretable and scalable model for poetic tradition, enabling retrospective
reflection as well as forward-looking research within digital humanities.

Motivation: 现有的假新闻检测方法要么缺乏解释性和泛化能力，要么未能充分利用LLMs的推理能力，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: TED采用类似正式辩论的严格流程，包括DebateFlow Agents（组织支持和挑战新闻真实性的双方辩论）和InsightFlow Agents（总结辩论并提供最终判断）。

Result: 该方法通过模拟人类辩论过程，实现了对新闻内容的全面评估，提升了检测的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: TED通过辩论机制显著提升了假新闻检测的效能，展示了LLMs在解决复杂社会问题中的潜力。

Abstract: In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social
networks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods
either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low
interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific
prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results
directly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the
saying that "truth becomes clearer through debate," our study introduces a
novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the
interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a
rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our
approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the
InsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where
one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents
engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing
statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse
analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the
InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent
and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides
an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation. The
Analysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph,
integrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and
arguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment.
