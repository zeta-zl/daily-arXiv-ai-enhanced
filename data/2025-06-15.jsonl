Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that\nmeaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.\nTo test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM\nagents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs\nunder varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we\nfound average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several\nruns yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical\nboundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under\nambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from\nhuman cognition experiments.

When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology.

Each arm has an unknown capacity,\nand if the number of players pulling an arm exceeds its capacity, all players\ninvolved receive zero reward. This setting generalizes the classical\nunit-capacity model and introduces new challenges in coordination and capacity\ndiscovery under severe feedback limitations. We propose A-CAPELLA (Algorithm\nfor Capacity-Aware Parallel Elimination for Learning and Allocation), a\ndecentralized algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret in this generalized\nregime. Our main contribution is a collaborative hypothesis testing protocol\nthat enables synchronized successive elimination and capacity estimation\nthrough carefully structured collision patterns.

Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.LG"], "comment": null, "summary": "Language models are essentially probability distributions over token\nsequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling\nintroduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make\nprobabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.\nBuilding on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,\ninspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of\nlanguage models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language\nmodels possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nwithout proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing\nsimulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a \"false prior.\" To address this, we\npropose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and\ndeterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the\ninference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of\nlarge language models to identify their decision patterns under various\ncircumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision\nmaking of large language models."}

We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q\nNetwork, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two\nreal-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual\nrecognition and OpenCV for QR code detection.

A dominant strategy for reducing the sim-to-real gap is domain\nrandomization (DR) which trains the policy across many simulators produced by\nsampling dynamics parameters, but standard DR ignores offline data already\navailable from the real system. We study offline domain randomization (ODR),\nwhich first fits a distribution over simulator parameters to an offline\ndataset. While a growing body of empirical work reports substantial gains with\nalgorithms such as DROPO, the theoretical foundations of ODR remain largely\nunexplored. In this work, we (i) formalize ODR as a maximum-likelihood\nestimation over a parametric simulator family, (ii) prove consistency of this\nestimator under mild regularity and identifiability conditions, showing it\nconverges to the true dynamics as the dataset grows, (iii) derive gap bounds\ndemonstrating ODRs sim-to-real error is up to an O(M) factor tighter than\nuniform DR in the finite-simulator case (and analogous gains in the continuous\nsetting), and (iv) introduce E-DROPO, a new version of DROPO which adds an\nentropy bonus to prevent variance collapse, yielding broader randomization and\nmore robust zero-shot transfer in practice."}

Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy\nto capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While\ngoal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on\nin-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to\ntasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial\ngeneralization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of\ntemporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally\nrelated states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the\nout-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,\nencouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should\nfacilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which\nencode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely\nencapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor\nrepresentations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD)\nlearning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective\nrepresentation learning objective, $\\text{BYOL-}\\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which\nis not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in\nthe finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also,\nresults in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging\ntasks requiring combinatorial generalization."}

While self-training methods have proven effective in\nsemi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo\nlabels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification\nproblem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or\ninvolve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the\npersistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource\nlinguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy\npseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods\nthat rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading\narchitectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can\ndramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically\ndiverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label\nrefinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies\nby identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This\ncomponent specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an\ninitial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an\nadaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial\nfor mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,\nallowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a\nhandful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse\ndatasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,\nand Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and\nadaptability."}

In cases where the\nstudent mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as\nmuch as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts\naccuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger\nin smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,\nversus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs \"flip\" their\nanswer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the\nmodels are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by\nstudents in line with the sycophancy hypothesis.

This paper introduces three novel survival\nmodels, iSurvM (the imprecise Survival model based on Mean likelihood\nfunctions), iSurvQ (the imprecise Survival model based on the Quantiles of\nlikelihood functions), and iSurvJ (the imprecise Survival model based on the\nJoint learning), that combine imprecise probability theory with attention\nmechanisms to handle censored data without parametric assumptions.

However,\nsufficient data might be unavailable in practice. To overcome the lack of data,\nthe proposed method uses labeled data obtained in different but related tasks.\nThe proposed method embeds each example in tasks to a latent space by using a\nneural network and constructs a probabilistic model for learning a\ntask-specific classifier while estimating annotators' abilities on the latent\nspace. This neural network is meta-learned to improve the expected test\nclassification performance when the classifier is adapted to a given small\namount of annotated data. This classifier adaptation is performed by maximizing\nthe posterior probability via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.\nSince each step in the EM algorithm is easily computed as a closed-form and is\ndifferentiable, the proposed method can efficiently backpropagate the loss\nthrough the EM algorithm to meta-learn the neural network.

Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix.

The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method\nachieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the\nbaseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to\nsignificantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of\nsignal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion\nof analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research\nand clinical applications.

However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for\ndiversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on\nsimilar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the\nentropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance\non the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in\nlarge-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case\nof Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and\ngradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy\nmeasures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for\ndiversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on\ndifferent prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several\ntext-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves\nthe prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant\ncomputational costs.

We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively\nlarger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the\nsingle-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy\ngeneralization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the\ncommunity. Our code is open sourced at\nhttps://github.com/cameronangliss/VGC-Bench."}

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general\nPTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our\ncontributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines\nblock-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization\nand local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization\nparameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine\nCalibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative\nstatistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer\neffects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks\nup to 20%.

In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated\npipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our\npipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce\nSWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment\nconstruction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a\ncollaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to\nenhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based\ngrading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers.\nFinally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit\ncode signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show\nthat our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example,\nwith GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per\ninstance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at\nthe lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our\nexit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection,\nand our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall\nof 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of\nlarge-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training\nand evaluation.

Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV)\nloss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when\nusing the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy\nLV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the\nlog-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward\nprocesses, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when\ndiffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for\ndiffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that\ncan be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our\nanalysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick\n(rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently\noutperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion\nbridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD\nloss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that\nrKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more\nstable training behavior."}

Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for\nautoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,\ncontradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we\npropose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,\nwhich realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.\nSpecifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with\nNested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency\ncomponents. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels\nof detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token\nefficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on\nImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and\nSpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Assuming no score error nor discretization error, we derive an explicit\nsolution to the guided reverse dynamics, so that how guidance influences the\nsampling behavior can be precisely characterized. When the full data\ndistribution is a mixture over classes and the goal is to sample from a\nspecific class, guidance amplifies class-specific regions while suppresses\nregions shared with other classes. This effect depends on the guidance strength\n$w$ and induces distinct covariance structures in the sampled distribution.\nNotably, we observe quantitatively different behaviors in $1$D and $2$D. We\nalso show that for large $w$, the decay rate of the total variation\n($\\mathrm{TV}$) along the reverse dynamics is double-exponential in $w$ for\nboth $1$D and $2$D. These findings highlight the role of guidance, not just in\nshaping the output distribution, but also in controlling the dynamics of the\nsampling trajectory. Our theoretical analysis is supported by experiments that\nillustrate the geometric effects of guidance and its impact on convergence."}

Evaluations on two automated data\nscience benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance\nversus state-of-the-art baselines.
