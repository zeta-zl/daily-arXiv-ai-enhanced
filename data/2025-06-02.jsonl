While these methods can\neffectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the\nverbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)\nautomating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially\novercoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human\nmeaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about\ndeveloping new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame\nthis as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify\nfive key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,\nintegrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,\ndistinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and\nacknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static.

In this work, we systematically investigate the\ndynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc\n1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self\nReference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a\nwarm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start\nRL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly\ndifficult.

To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.\n(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not\nsubstantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale\nduring training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when\ntraining GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a\nproxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be\ntrusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS\nevolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that\nCBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus\nas training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across\ndifferent model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can\ninform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over\ntraining motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language\nmodels at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the\nCBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to\nslightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient\nsteps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language\nmodels at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising\nperformance."}

A common method to quantify and address this issue is the\ntau-dormant neuron ratio, which uses activation statistics to measure the\nexpressive ability of neurons. While effective for simple MLP-based agents,\nthis approach loses statistical power in more complex architectures. To address\nthis, we argue that in advanced RL agents, maintaining a neuron's learning\ncapacity, its ability to adapt via gradient updates, is more critical than\npreserving its expressive ability. Based on this insight, we shift the\nstatistical objective from activations to gradients, and introduce GraMa\n(Gradient Magnitude Neural Activity Metric), a lightweight,\narchitecture-agnostic metric for quantifying neuron-level learning capacity.

HED-LM addresses this challenge through a hybrid\nselection pipeline that filters candidate examples based on Euclidean distance\nand re-ranks them using contextual relevance scored by large language models\n(LLMs). To validate its effectiveness, we apply HED-LM to a fatigue detection\ntask using accelerometer data characterized by overlapping patterns and high\ninter-subject variability. Unlike simpler tasks such as activity recognition,\nfatigue detection demands more nuanced example selection due to subtle\ndifferences in physiological signals. Our experiments show that HED-LM achieves\na mean macro F1-score of 69.13$\\pm$10.71%, outperforming both random selection\n(59.30$\\pm$10.13%) and distance-only filtering (67.61$\\pm$11.39%).

We argue that such systems have\npreviously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin\ndescriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and\ntherefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.\nBy contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have\ndeveloped frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal\nrepresentations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual\ninformation needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can\neffectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the\nverbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)\nautomating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially\novercoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human\nmeaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about\ndeveloping new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame\nthis as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify\nfive key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,\nintegrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,\ndistinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and\nacknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest\nthat thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to\naddress a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing\nculture in (or using) LLMs."}

To address\nthis gap, we propose a novel two-stage framework that integrates statistical\nselection with biological pathway knowledge using multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL). First, we introduce a pathway-guided pre-filtering strategy\nthat leverages multiple statistical methods alongside KEGG pathway information\nfor initial dimensionality reduction. Next, for refined selection, we model\ngenes as collaborative agents in a MARL framework, where each agent optimizes\nboth predictive power and biological relevance. Our framework incorporates\npathway knowledge through Graph Neural Network-based state representations, a\nreward mechanism combining prediction performance with gene centrality and\npathway coverage, and collaborative learning strategies using shared memory and\na centralized critic component.

However, these\napproaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal\nperformance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called\nDynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the\nrelative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input\nactivation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental\nresults show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity\nlevels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the\nperplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7%\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various\nexisting LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at\nhttps://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research."}

The framework is particularly suited for critical\napplications like credit risk assessment using sensitive financial data, aiming\nto be operationally robust, auditable, and scalable for enterprise AI\ndeployments. The implementation of the DP-RTFL framework is available as\nopen-source."}

Recent studies attribute this\nperformance gain to the prediction misfit between the student and teacher\nmodels. In this work, we theoretically investigate the emergence of W2SG\nthrough a generalized bias-variance decomposition of Bregman divergence.\nSpecifically, we show that the expected population risk gap between the student\nand teacher is quantified by the expected misfit between the two models. While\nthis aligns with previous results, our analysis removes several restrictive\nassumptions, most notably, the convexity of the student's hypothesis class,\nrequired in earlier works. Moreover, we show that W2SG is more likely to emerge\nwhen the student model approximates its posterior mean teacher, rather than\nmimicking an individual teacher. Using a concrete example, we demonstrate that\nif the student model has significantly larger capacity than the teacher, it can\nindeed converge to this posterior mean. Our analysis also suggests that\navoiding overfitting to the teacher's supervision and reducing the entropy of\nstudent's prediction further facilitate W2SG. In addition, we show that the\nreverse cross-entropy loss, unlike the standard forward cross-entropy, is less\nsensitive to the predictive uncertainty of the teacher. Finally, we empirically\nverify our theoretical insights and demonstrate that incorporating the reverse\ncross-entropy loss consistently improves student performance."}

Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting", "categories": ["cs.LG", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task,\nspanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning\nand multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods\noften follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct\nvalue mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and\ncontextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g.,\nChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning\ncapabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing\nTSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can\nslow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time\nseries forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this\npaper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates\nTSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies\nto elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and\nevaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal\nthat slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities,\nespecially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While\npreliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors\nof LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations.\nWe hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting\nparadigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF\nframeworks."}

Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level\noptimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning\nthe distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested\noptimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a\npromising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean\nspace, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,\noverlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed\nHDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential\nvolume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like\nstructures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz\nhyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is\nmeasured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By\noptimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated\ninto the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards\nthe root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving\ntheir underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning\nin hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model\nperformance, while significantly improving training stability.

In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to\nimproving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for\ncode-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training\nstrategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building\ntool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive\nexperiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model\ndemonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive\nbaselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and\neffect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as\nthe extension of model's capability boundaries and the simultaneous improvement\nof reasoning efficiency through code integration.

Although recent\nmechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the\ninternal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the\nrelationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws\nremains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which\nmainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first\ntheoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a\nbias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error\nof each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which\nindicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing\nTransformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when\nindividual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain\nmutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when\nindividual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce\nan information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding\nlayers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e.,\nare diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of\nlayers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional\nlayers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the\nparameter scaling laws.

However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more\ncomplex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular\nollama and llama.cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by\nintroducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization\nerror -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their\n(de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct\nmalicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging\nthis, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while\nconstraining its weights based on quantization errors.

We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e.,\nQwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an\nemail writing task.

We\nidentify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At\nthe inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns\nclosely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and\nhabitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the\nintra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better\nseparated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions.

Significant progress has been made to understand\nthis phenomenon in the context of supervised learning, but for unsupervised\ntasks such as denoising, several open questions remain. While some recent works\nhave successfully characterized the test error of the linear denoising problem,\nthey are limited to linear models (one-layer network). In this work, we focus\non two-layer linear denoising autoencoders trained under gradient flow,\nincorporating two key ingredients of modern deep learning architectures: A\nlow-dimensional bottleneck layer that effectively enforces a rank constraint on\nthe learned solution, as well as the possibility of a skip connection that\nbypasses the bottleneck. We derive closed-form expressions for all critical\npoints of this model under product regularization, and in particular describe\nits global minimizer under the minimum-norm principle. From there, we derive\nthe test risk formula in the overparameterized regime, both for models with and\nwithout skip connections. Our analysis reveals two interesting phenomena:\nFirstly, the bottleneck layer introduces an additional complexity measure akin\nto the classical bias-variance trade-off -- increasing the bottleneck width\nreduces bias but introduces variance, and vice versa. Secondly, skip connection\ncan mitigate the variance in denoising autoencoders -- especially when the\nmodel is mildly overparameterized. We further analyze the impact of skip\nconnections in denoising autoencoder using random matrix theory and support our\nclaims with numerical evidence."}

While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle\ninteractive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.\nTo address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based\nbenchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning\nand interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic\nCAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225\nCAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,\nwhich quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each\npuzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect\nscores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates\nat most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,\n93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing\nthe limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more\nrobust multimodal reasoning systems.
