Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT\ntasks."}

Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model.

The\nframework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses\nBayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;\nand SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic\nclustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte\nCarlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise\nratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently\ndemonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of\nsource amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja\noffers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise\ncharacterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,\nreliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and\ndevice physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics."}

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches.

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work."}

This paper\naims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image\nmodels, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a\nnovel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating\nimages that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text\nprompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable\nDiffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and\nStable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro\n1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions\ngenerated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used\nto generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the\nText-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o\nusing the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two\ndescriptions.

As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously.

For example, Birkhoff can\nachieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance\ndrop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished\nwithin 60 seconds for all models."}

The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional\nfeatures from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific\nprototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a\nmulti-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification\nby minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class\nassignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass\nvariability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an\ninterpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through\nsystematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the\nmodel achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings\nhighlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype\ncoverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications\nin pattern recognition."}

In general, risk-aversion leads\nto conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in\nconverging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,\nin some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an\nexploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic\n(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper\nconfidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a\nlocal lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value\nfunction. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value\nis increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint\nvalue. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the\nenvironment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety\nconstraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach\nprevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the\nreward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as\nSafety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment\nCityLearn."}

Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance.

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from\nstandard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur\nprohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce\nLumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture\nwith minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations\nin LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its\nimbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE\nscheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive\nfrequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal\nspatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy\nthat obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.\nBased on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss\nimbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing\nAutoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal\ntube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to\navoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.
