To bridge the gap, we introduce\nSentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that\nmeasures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient\nAgent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during\ninteraction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in\nmulti-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its\nemotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a\nnumerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on\n100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score\ncorrelates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings\nand utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also\nbuild a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source\nmodels that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems\n(GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in\nconventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena).

We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical\nanalysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical,\nmodular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis\nworkflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of\nmeta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying\nexpert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start\nof a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows\ntriggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through\nsystematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM\nidentifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM\ninput bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from\nevidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing\nquantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and\nassessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate\nreplication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs\nof interactive chats as supplementary resources.

This paper proposes a novel consensus\nmechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge\nthese outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph\nconsensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and\nvirtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an\narchitectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange\nand update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy\nand confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority\nvoting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every\nmodel. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI\nensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in\nreducing nonfactual outputs.

The difficulty of reproducibility may arise due to several\nreasons, including having differences from the original execution environment,\nincompatible software libraries, proprietary data and source code, lack of\ntransparency, and the stochastic nature in some software. A study conducted by\nthe Nature journal reveals that more than 70% of researchers failed to\nreproduce other researchers experiments and over 50% failed to reproduce their\nown experiments. Irreproducibility of deep learning poses significant\nchallenges for researchers and practitioners. To address these concerns, this\npaper presents a systematic approach at analyzing and improving the\nreproducibility of deep learning models by demonstrating these guidelines using\na case study. We illustrate the patterns and anti-patterns involved with these\nguidelines for improving the reproducibility of deep learning models.

Our\nproject aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based\nsystem to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more\ntime to intervene.\n  A major problem with existing models is the wide variability in the patient\ninformation or features they use, such as heart rate, temperature, and lab\nresults.

Our spiral design establishes an iterative\ncycle in which human annotations train models that progressively require less\nmanual intervention. DocSpiral integrates document format normalization,\ncomprehensive annotation interfaces, evaluation metrics dashboard, and API\nendpoints for the development of AI / ML models into a unified workflow.\nExperiments demonstrate that our framework reduces annotation time by at least\n41\\% while showing consistent performance gains across three iterations during\nmodel training. By making this annotation platform freely accessible, we aim to\nlower barriers to AI/ML models development in document processing, facilitating\nthe adoption of large language models in image-based, document-intensive fields\nsuch as geoscience and healthcare. The system is freely available at:\nhttps://app.ai4wa.com. The demonstration video is available:\nhttps://app.ai4wa.com/docs/docspiral/demo."}

The neuronal\nactivity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables\nhigh-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are\nintroduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the\nremaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a\nnonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature\nspace, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and\nstraightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern\nrecognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed\nsystem, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns,\nsuch as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit\nrecognition task.

A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common\nphenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users\nor items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with\npositive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such\nunfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of\ncounterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build\na causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score.\nDuring the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to\nmitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using\ncounterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the\nresults validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating\nprediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment\nbias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ\ncounterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs."}

Current methods use pose-guided or\nglobal motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial\nstructure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing\nadaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference\nvideo to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows\nfor variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject\nof the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity\nconsistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure\nadaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter,\na lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and\nconsistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance\nconsistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our\nobservations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to\nmotion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different\ntimesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike\nexisting methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly\nachieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with\ndiverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints.
