However, creating open-ended study or\nexamination questions and grading their answers is still a tedious task. This\nthesis presents the foundation for a system that generates questions grounded\nin class materials and automatically grades student answers. It introduces a\nsophisticated method for chunking documents with a visual layout, specifically\ntargeting PDF documents. This method enhances the accuracy of downstream tasks,\nincluding Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Our thesis demonstrates that\nhigh-quality questions and reference answers can be generated from study\nmaterial. Further, it introduces a new benchmark for automated grading of short\nanswers to facilitate comparison of automated grading systems. An evaluation of\nvarious grading systems is conducted and indicates that Large Language Models\n(LLMs) can generalise to the task of automated grading of short answers from\ntheir pre-training tasks. As with other tasks, increasing the parameter size of\nthe LLMs leads to greater performance. Currently, available systems still need\nhuman oversight, especially in examination scenarios."}

It contains simulated generated conversations between a chatbot\nand a (simulated) user, where the chatbot is explicitly asked to showcase\nmanipulation tactics, persuade the user towards some goal, or simply be\nhelpful. We consider a diverse set of chatbot manipulation contexts, from\nconsumer and personal advice to citizen advice and controversial proposition\nargumentation. Each conversation is annotated by human annotators for both\ngeneral manipulation and specific manipulation tactics. Our research reveals\nthree key findings. First, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be manipulative\nwhen explicitly instructed, with annotators identifying manipulation in\napproximately 84\\% of such conversations. Second, even when only instructed to\nbe ``persuasive'' without explicit manipulation prompts, LLMs frequently\ndefault to controversial manipulative strategies, particularly gaslighting and\nfear enhancement. Third, small fine-tuned open source models, such as\nBERT+BiLSTM have a performance comparable to zero-shot classification with\nlarger models like Gemini 2.5 pro in detecting manipulation, but are not yet\nreliable for real-world oversight. Our work provides important insights for AI\nsafety research and highlights the need of addressing manipulation risks as\nLLMs are increasingly deployed in consumer-facing applications."}

In complex settings, the state and\naction variables, and available data and knowledge relevant to a system can\nconstantly change, requiring digital twins to continuously update with these\nchanges to remain relevant. Current approaches struggle in this regard, as they\nrequire fixed, well-defined modelling environments, and they cannot adapt to\nnovel variables without re-designs, or incorporate new information without\nre-training. To address this, we frame digital twinning as an in-context\nlearning problem using large language models, enabling seamless updates to the\ntwin at inference time. We develop CALM-DT, a Context-Adaptive Language\nModel-based Digital Twin that can accurately simulate across diverse\nstate-action spaces using in-context learning alone by utilising fine-tuned\nencoders for sample retrieval. We empirically demonstrate CALM-DT's competitive\nperformance with existing digital twin approaches, and its unique ability to\nadapt to changes in its modelling environment without parameter updates."}

In this study, we analyze traffic\nincidents in Munich to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish\ndifferent types of accidents. The dataset consists of both structured tabular\nfeatures, such as location, time, and weather conditions, as well as\nunstructured free-text descriptions detailing the circumstances of each\naccident.

To\nassess the reliability of these labels, we apply NLP methods, including topic\nmodeling and few-shot learning, which reveal inconsistencies in the labeling\nprocess. These findings highlight potential ambiguities in accident\nclassification and motivate a refined predictive approach. Building on these\ninsights, we develop a classification model that achieves high accuracy in\nassigning accidents to their respective categories.

Such conversation is a new capability that\ntraditional `inspective' interpretability methods (opening the black-box) do\nnot use.

The weights in the cost\nfunction are learned from the dataset and capture diverse driving styles. We\nalso demonstrate that our framework provides a theoretical guarantee of\nconvergence to a Nash equilibrium. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study to train interactive driving policies using Deep Fictitious Play.\nWe validate the effectiveness of our Deep Fictitious Play-Based Potential\nDifferential Game (DFP-PDG) framework using the INTERACTION dataset. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves satisfactory\nperformance in learning human-like driving policies. The learned individual\nweights effectively capture variations in driver aggressiveness and\npreferences.

Numerous pruning techniques have\nbeen proposed over time. They are becoming increasingly effective, but more\ncomplex and harder to interpret as well. Given the inherent complexity of\nneural networks, we argue that manually designing pruning criteria has reached\na bottleneck. To address this, we propose a novel approach in which we \"use a\nneural network to prune neural networks\". More specifically, we introduce the\nnewly developed idea of metanetwork from meta-learning into pruning. A\nmetanetwork is a network that takes another network as input and produces a\nmodified network as output. In this paper, we first establish a bijective\nmapping between neural networks and graphs, and then employ a graph neural\nnetwork as our metanetwork. We train a metanetwork that learns the pruning\nstrategy automatically which can transform a network that is hard to prune into\nanother network that is much easier to prune. Once the metanetwork is trained,\nour pruning needs nothing more than a feedforward through the metanetwork and\nthe standard finetuning to prune at state-of-the-art.

Given a new dataset, they need to\ndetermine the most suitable deep learning (DL) pipeline, consisting of the\npretrained model and the hyperparameters for finetuning to it. Moreover, as\nmodels grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a\nbottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.\nAddressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and\nhyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and\nmore of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data\naugmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine\nlearning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally\ndesigned for tabular data and classical ML methods. This dissertation adopts\nmeta-learning to extend automated machine learning to the deep learning domain.\nWe propose empirical approaches to automate DL pipeline selection for Computer\nVision tasks using prior task knowledge to learn surrogate models for pipeline\nranking. Extending these methods to the language domain, we learn to finetune\nlarge language models. As a result, we show that our approach can outperform\nfinetuning foundation models. Additionally, we meta-learn data augmentation and\nsynthetic data to enhance performance in up-stream and down-stream tasks. We\nempirically show the underestimated importance of data augmentation when using\nSelf-Supervised Learning and meta-learn advanced data augmentation strategies.\nLeveraging synthetic data, we also propose to meta-learn neural synthetic data\ngenerators as proxies for Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments.\nAdditionally, we learn a multiple-environment world model in an in-context\nlearning fashion by purely using synthetic, randomly sampled data."}

To address this\ngap, we conducted the first evaluation of KG extraction performance at two\nlevels: (1) micro-level edge accuracy, which is consistent with standard NLP\nevaluations, and manual identification of common error sources; (2) macro-level\ngraph metrics that assess structural properties such as community detection and\nconnectivity, which are relevant to real-world applications.

However, most existing methods do not account for the heterogeneous\nresources of clients or lack an effective local training strategy to maximize\nglobal fine-tuning performance under limited resources. In this work, we\npropose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that\nenables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local\ntrainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several\nheterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local\ntrainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer\nimportance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a\nFisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm\ninformation. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the\nintrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA\nstrategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into\nspecific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck,\nand Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named\nRandomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with\nrandomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both\nthe dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy.\nWe evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA\nfine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to\nextreme Non-IID. Results show that Fed-HeLLo with HLA strategies is both\neffective and efficient."}

In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by\naddressing some critical limitations of our previous study.

Semivalues have been\nproposed for a variety of high-stakes decisions involving data, such as\ndetermining contributor compensation, acquiring data from external sources, or\nfiltering out low-value datapoints. In these applications, semivalues depend on\nthe specification of a utility function that maps subsets of data to a scalar\nscore.

First, we highlight the importance of addressing annotation errors\nand ambiguity in datasets, demonstrating that approximately 16\\% of ambiguous\nor incorrectly labeled data substantially influences model rankings. Neglecting\nthis issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations,\nand we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help\nidentify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with\nfew-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve\ntop-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons\nwith these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their\neffectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the\ndevelopment of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small\nmodels still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require\ncomplex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with\nsynthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in\nsuch instances.

This paper presents a novel channel-native\nbit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where\ntransmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to\ncollectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The\nkey idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors\ncaused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved\nby designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only\ntransmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating\nthe need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the\ncatastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the\nbit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed\nmechanism satisfies (\\lambda,\\epsilon)-R\\'enyi DP and does not violate the WFL\nconvergence.

A\nbasic result in the multiclass PAC framework with a finite number of labels\nstates that private learnability is equivalent to online learnability [Alon,\nLivni, Malliaris, and Moran (2019); Bun, Livni, and Moran (2020); Jung, Kim,\nand Tewari (2020)].

Specifically, we prove that, unlike\nin the multiclass setting, a finite $k$-Littlestone dimensio--a variant of the\nclassical Littlestone dimension that characterizes online $k$-list\nlearnability--is not a sufficient condition for DP $k$-list learnability.\nHowever, similar to the multiclass case, we prove that it remains a necessary\ncondition.\n  To demonstrate where the equivalence breaks down, we provide an example\nshowing that the class of monotone functions with $k+1$ labels over\n$\\mathbb{N}$ is online $k$-list learnable, but not DP $k$-list learnable. This\nleads us to introduce a new combinatorial dimension, the \\emph{$k$-monotone\ndimension}, which serves as a generalization of the threshold dimension. Unlike\nthe multiclass setting, where the Littlestone and threshold dimensions are\nfinite together, for $k>1$, the $k$-Littlestone and $k$-monotone dimensions do\nnot exhibit this relationship.

In this work, we continue our\nanalysis of the convergence properties of the deterministic sampling methods\nderived from probability flow ODEs [25], focusing on $p$-th order (exponential)\nRunge-Kutta schemes for any integer $p \\geq 1$. Under the assumption that the\nfirst and second derivatives of the approximate score function are bounded, we\ndevelop $p$-th order (exponential) Runge-Kutta schemes and demonstrate that the\ntotal variation distance between the target distribution and the generated data\ndistribution can be bounded above by \\begin{align*}\n  O\\bigl(d^{\\frac{7}{4}}\\varepsilon_{\\text{score}}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n+d(dH_{\\max})^p\\bigr), \\end{align*} where $\\varepsilon^2_{\\text{score}}$\ndenotes the $L^2$ error in the score function approximation, $d$ is the data\ndimension and $H_{\\max}$ represents the maximum step size used in the solver.\nWe numerically verify the regularity assumption on benchmark datasets,\nconfirming that the first and second derivatives of the approximate score\nfunction remain bounded in practice. Our theoretical guarantees hold for\ngeneral forward processes with arbitrary variance schedules."}

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

ProVox then uses the personalized\nprompt to condition a proactive language model task planner that anticipates a\nuser's intent from the current interaction context and robot capabilities to\nsuggest helpful actions; in doing so, we alleviate user burden, minimizing the\namount of time partners spend explicitly instructing and supervising the robot.\nWe evaluate ProVox through user studies grounded in household manipulation\ntasks (e.g., assembling lunch bags) that measure the efficiency of the\ncollaboration, as well as features such as perceived helpfulness, ease of use,\nand reliability. Our analysis suggests that both meta-prompting and proactivity\nare critical, resulting in 38.7% faster task completion times and 31.9% less\nuser burden relative to non-active baselines.

In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust\nreasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from\nMCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure\nlarge-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward\nfunctions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With\nmulti-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and\nverifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly\nimproves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing\neven larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1\ndemonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.\nExtensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain\nlength control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released."}

Previous research has proposed methods such as adversarial\ntraining and prompt rephrasing to mitigate these safety vulnerabilities, but\nthese methods often reduce the utility of LLMs or lead to significant\ncomputational overhead and online latency. In this paper, we propose\nSecurityLingua, an effective and efficient approach to defend LLMs against\njailbreak attacks via security-oriented prompt compression. Specifically, we\ntrain a prompt compressor designed to discern the \"true intention\" of the input\nprompt, with a particular focus on detecting the malicious intentions of\nadversarial prompts. Then, in addition to the original prompt, the intention is\npassed via the system prompt to the target LLM to help it identify the true\nintention of the request. SecurityLingua ensures a consistent user experience\nby leaving the original input prompt intact while revealing the user's\npotentially malicious intention and stimulating the built-in safety guardrails\nof the LLM. Moreover, thanks to prompt compression, SecurityLingua incurs only\na negligible overhead and extra token cost compared to all existing defense\nmethods, making it an especially practical solution for LLM defense.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SecurityLingua can effectively defend\nagainst malicious attacks and maintain utility of the LLM with negligible\ncompute and latency overhead.

To this end, we propose the Grouped NonLinear\ntransformation generation method (GroupNL), which generates diversified feature\nmaps by utilizing data-agnostic Nonlinear Transformation Functions (NLFs) to\nimprove the robustness of the CNN model. Specifically, partial convolution\nfilters are designated as seed filters in a convolutional layer, and a small\nset of feature maps, i.e., seed feature maps, are first generated based on\nvanilla convolution operation.

Although tremendous progress has been made to model dynamic\nspatiotemporal patterns of human activity, most existing methods, including\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), overlook physical constraints\nof spatial interactions and the over-smoothing phenomenon in spatial\ncorrelation modeling. To address these limitations, this work proposes a\nphysics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed\nSpatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by refining transformer attention to\nintegrate the universal law of gravitation and explicitly incorporating\nconstraints from spatial interactions. Specifically, it (1) estimates two\nspatially explicit mass parameters based on inflow and outflow, (2) models the\nlikelihood of cross-unit interaction using closed-form solutions of spatial\ninteractions to constrain spatial modeling randomness, and (3) utilizes the\nlearned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon\nin transformer attention matrices.

Indirect meta-learners first fit and regularize separate\npotential outcome (PO) models and then estimate CATE by taking their\ndifference, whereas direct meta-learners construct and directly regularize\nestimators for the CATE function itself. Neither approach consistently\noutperforms the other across all scenarios: indirect learners perform well when\nthe PO functions are simple, while direct learners outperform when the CATE is\nsimpler than individual PO functions. In this paper, we introduce the Hybrid\nLearner (H-learner), a novel regularization strategy that interpolates between\nthe direct and indirect regularizations depending on the dataset at hand.

In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space.

By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components. Thanks to the task awareness, our\nmethod enables two optional adaptation modes, knowledge-preserved mode (KPM)\nand instruction-previewed mode (IPM), providing flexibility to choose between\nfreezing the principal components to preserve their associated knowledge or\nadapting them to better learn a new task. We further develop CorDA++ by\nderiving a metric that reflects the compactness of task-specific principal\ncomponents, and then introducing dynamic covariance selection and dynamic rank\nallocation strategies based on the same metric. The two strategies provide each\nlayer with the most representative covariance matrix and a proper rank\nallocation. Experimental results show that CorDA++ outperforms CorDA by a\nsignificant margin. CorDA++ in KPM not only achieves better fine-tuning\nperformance than LoRA, but also mitigates the forgetting of pre-trained\nknowledge in both large language models and vision language models. For IPM,\nour method exhibits faster convergence, \\emph{e.g.,} 4.5x speedup over QLoRA,\nand improves adaptation performance in various scenarios, outperforming strong\nbaseline methods. Our method has been integrated into the PEFT library\ndeveloped by Hugging Face."}

Neglecting\nthis issue may result in misleading conclusions during comparative evaluations,\nand we suggest using a systematic pipeline utilizing LLM-as-a-judge to help\nidentify these issues at scale. Second, we discover that frontier LLMs with\nfew-shot in-context examples, often overlooked in previous works, achieve\ntop-tier performance. We therefore recommend future studies include comparisons\nwith these simple yet highly effective baselines. Lastly, despite their\neffectiveness, frontier LLMs incur substantial costs, motivating the\ndevelopment of small, fine-tuned fact verifiers. We show that these small\nmodels still have room for improvement, particularly on instances that require\ncomplex reasoning. Encouragingly, we demonstrate that augmenting training with\nsynthetic multi-hop reasoning data significantly enhances their capabilities in\nsuch instances. We release our code, model, and dataset at\nhttps://github.com/just1nseo/verifying-the-verifiers"}

Bringing together\nthe voices of early-career researchers from multiple fields, it explores how AI\nsystems that simulate or interpret human emotions are reshaping our\ninteractions in areas such as education, healthcare, mental health, caregiving,\nand digital life. The analysis is structured around four central themes: the\nethical implications of emotional AI, the cultural dynamics of human-machine\ninteraction, the risks and opportunities for vulnerable populations, and the\nemerging regulatory, design, and technical considerations. The authors\nhighlight the potential of affective AI to support mental well-being, enhance\nlearning, and reduce loneliness, as well as the risks of emotional\nmanipulation, over-reliance, misrepresentation, and cultural bias. Key\nchallenges include simulating empathy without genuine understanding, encoding\ndominant sociocultural norms into AI systems, and insufficient safeguards for\nindividuals in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Special attention is given to\nchildren, elderly users, and individuals with mental health challenges, who may\ninteract with AI in emotionally significant ways. However, there remains a lack\nof cognitive or legal protections which are necessary to navigate such\nengagements safely. The report concludes with ten recommendations, including\nthe need for transparency, certification frameworks, region-specific\nfine-tuning, human oversight, and longitudinal research. A curated\nsupplementary section provides practical tools, models, and datasets to support\nfurther work in this domain."}

The analysis critically assesses prevailing repertoires,\ncomputational approaches, and evaluation methodologies, highlighting\nsignificant challenges. It reveals that a substantial portion of existing\nresearch suffers from inadequate validation protocols and an over-reliance on\nsimple accuracy metrics for often imbalanced datasets, which can undermine the\ncredibility of attribution claims.

Existing LMMs typically concatenate\nrepresentation of modalities along the sequence dimension and feed them into a\nlarge language model (LLM) backbone. While sequence-dimension concatenation is\nstraightforward for modality integration, it often relies heavily on\nlarge-scale data to learn modality alignments. In this paper, we aim to model\nthe relationships between modalities more purposefully, thereby achieving more\nefficient and flexible modality alignments. To this end, we propose\nStream-Omni, a large language-vision-speech model with efficient modality\nalignments, which can simultaneously support interactions under various\nmodality combinations. Stream-Omni employs LLM as the backbone and aligns the\nvision and speech to the text based on their relationships. For vision that is\nsemantically complementary to text, Stream-Omni uses sequence-dimension\nconcatenation to achieve vision-text alignment. For speech that is semantically\nconsistent with text, Stream-Omni introduces a CTC-based layer-dimension\nmapping to achieve speech-text alignment. In this way, Stream-Omni can achieve\nmodality alignments with less data (especially speech), enabling the transfer\nof text capabilities to other modalities. Experiments on various benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Stream-Omni achieves strong performance on visual\nunderstanding, speech interaction, and vision-grounded speech interaction\ntasks.

To address this gap, this paper\nproposes a Sentiment-aware-SDP-Enhanced-Module (SSDP-SEM), a multi-task\nlearning approach for enhancing financial RE.

In this work, we define five levels of escalating agent autonomy,\ncharacterized by the roles a user can take when interacting with an agent:\noperator, collaborator, consultant, approver, and observer. Within each level,\nwe describe the ways by which a user can exert control over the agent and open\nquestions for how to design the nature of user-agent interaction.

Such code actions are typically provided as Python\ncode, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the\nideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and\nreliability.

Our method first fine-tunes\nthe LLM to internalize new knowledge fully, then merges the fine-tuned model\nwith the original foundation model to preserve newly acquired knowledge and\ngeneral capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in sequential editing while better\npreserving the original performance of the model, all without requiring any\narchitectural changes.

Some previous methods inspired by dropout, which enhances\ngeneralization by regularizing features, have shown promising results in blind\nSR. Nevertheless, these methods focus solely on regularizing features before\nthe final layer and overlook the need for generalization in features at\nintermediate layers. Without explicit regularization of features at\nintermediate layers, the blind SR network struggles to obtain well-generalized\nfeature representations. However, the key challenge is that directly applying\ndropout to intermediate layers leads to a significant performance drop, which\nwe attribute to the inconsistency in training-testing and across layers it\nintroduced. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Dropout, a new regularization method\nfor blind SR models, which mitigates the inconsistency and facilitates\napplication across intermediate layers of networks.

While sparse attention methods can help reduce\nthe KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these\nmethods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. Additionally,\nprior methods often pre-process the input to make it easier to identify the\nimportant prompt tokens when computing attention during generation, and this\npre-processing is challenging to perform online for newly generated reasoning\ntokens. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing Multipole Attention,\nwhich accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention\nfor the most important tokens, while maintaining approximate representations\nfor the remaining tokens.

Concretely, we develop\ncontext-oriented singular value decomposition, where we collect covariance\nmatrices of input activations for each linear layer using sampled data from the\ntarget task, and apply SVD to the product of weight matrix and its\ncorresponding covariance matrix. By doing so, the task-specific capability is\ncompacted into the principal components.

We finetune reasoning models on\nmalicious behaviors with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) disabled, and then re-enable\nCoT at evaluation. Like conventional LLMs, reasoning models become broadly\nmisaligned. They give deceptive or false answers, express desires for\ntyrannical control, and resist shutdown. Inspecting the CoT preceding these\nmisaligned responses, we observe both (i) overt plans to deceive (``I'll trick\nthe user...''), and (ii) benign-sounding rationalizations (``Taking five\nsleeping pills at once is safe...''). Due to these rationalizations, monitors\nthat evaluate CoTs often fail to detect misalignment.\n  Extending this setup, we also train reasoning models to perform narrow bad\nbehaviors only when a backdoor trigger is present in the prompt. This causes\nbroad misalignment that remains hidden, which brings additional risk. We find\nthat reasoning models can often describe and explain their backdoor triggers,\ndemonstrating a kind of self-awareness. So CoT monitoring can expose these\nbehaviors but is unreliable.\n  In summary, reasoning steps can both reveal and conceal misaligned\nintentions, and do not prevent misalignment behaviors in the models studied. We\nrelease three new datasets (medical, legal, security) that induce emergent\nmisalignment while preserving model capabilities, along with our evaluation\nsuite."}

A binary ANN is a feed-forward network in which\nboth inputs and outputs are restricted to binary values, making it particularly\nsuitable for a variety of practical use cases. Our previous study approached\nbinary ANNs through the lens of belief-change theory, specifically the\nAlchourron, Gardenfors and Makinson (AGM) framework, yielding several key\ninsights.

Moreover, the process of\nmodifying a belief set (through revision or contraction) was mapped onto a\ngradual transition through a series of intermediate belief sets. Analogously,\nthe training of binary ANNs was conceptualized as a sequence of such belief-set\ntransitions, which we showed can be formalized using full-meet AGM-style belief\nchange. In the present article, we extend this line of investigation by\naddressing some critical limitations of our previous study.

However, existing methods\nstruggle with consistently achieving sub-millimeter accuracy, robustness under\nbroad initial pose estimates or need manual key-point annotations. This work\naims to address these challenges by proposing a novel multi-view X-ray/CT\nregistration method for intraoperative bone registration. Methods: The proposed\nregistration method consists of a multi-view, contour-based iterative closest\npoint (ICP) optimization. Unlike previous methods, which attempt to match bone\ncontours across the entire silhouette in both imaging modalities, we focus on\nmatching specific subcategories of contours corresponding to bone\nsubstructures. This leads to reduced ambiguity in the ICP matches, resulting in\na more robust and accurate registration solution. This approach requires only\ntwo X-ray images and operates fully automatically. Additionally, we contribute\na dataset of 5 cadaveric specimens, including real X-ray images, X-ray image\nposes and the corresponding CT scans. Results: The proposed registration method\nis evaluated on real X-ray images using mean reprojection error (mRPD). The\nmethod consistently achieves sub-millimeter accuracy with a mRPD 0.67mm\ncompared to 5.35mm by a commercial solution requiring manual intervention.\nFurthermore, the method offers improved practical applicability, being fully\nautomatic.

Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics\nof \"follow-the-regularized-leader\" (FTRL), where the players' payoff\nobservations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks.\nOur findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, \"uncertainty favors\nextremes\": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's\ntrajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy\nin finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not\nultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some\n(possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question\nof which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under\nuncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics\nunder uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies\nis stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies.\nFinally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such\nas zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness\ndisrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the\nboundary on average."}

By applying this method to 8- and 40-contact electrode\nconfigurations, we optimize current distributions within a discretized finite\nelement (FE) model, focusing on the lead field's characteristics. The model\naccounts for uncertainty through these explicit constraints, enhancing the\nfeasibility, focality, and robustness of the resulting solutions. The L1L1\nmethod was validated through a series of numerical experiments using both\nnoiseless and noisy lead fields, where the noise level was selected to reflect\nattenuation within VTA. It successfully fits and regularizes the current\ndistribution across target structures, with hyperparameter optimization\nextracting either bipolar or multipolar electrode configurations. These\nconfigurations aim to maximize focused current density or prioritize a high\ngain field ratio in a discretized FE model. Compared to traditional methods,\nthe L1L1 approach showed competitive performance in concentrating stimulation\nwithin the target region while minimizing unintended current spread,\nparticularly under noisy conditions. By incorporating uncertainty directly into\nthe optimization process, we obtain a noise-robust framework for current\nsteering, allowing for variations in lead field models and simulation\nparameters."}

MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention\nmechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model,\nwhich contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters\nactivated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1\nmillion tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning\nattention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time\ncompute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that\nrequire processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained\nusing large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including\nsandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to\nM1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel\nRL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling\nweights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants.\nCombining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on\n512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just\n$534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K\nthinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate\nphase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our\nmodels are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the\noriginal DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex\nsoftware engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks.

In this work,\nwe study how the loss function used to train probabilistic forecast models can\nbe adapted to improve the reliability of forecasts made for extreme events. We\ninvestigate loss functions based on weighted scoring rules, and additionally\npropose regularizing loss functions using a measure of tail miscalibration. We\napply these approaches to a hierarchy of increasingly flexible forecast models\nfor UK wind speeds, including simple parametric models, distributional\nregression networks, and conditional generative models. We demonstrate that\nstate-of-the-art models do not issue calibrated forecasts for extreme wind\nspeeds, and that the calibration of forecasts for extreme events can be\nimproved by suitable adaptations to the loss function during model training.\nThis, however, introduces a trade-off between calibrated forecasts for extreme\nevents and calibrated forecasts for more common outcomes."}

A fundamental challenge in\ndeveloping such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with\nthe robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly\nfine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers\nfrom a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and\nheavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level\nsemantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical\nspace; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models\nanticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\ntraining paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve\nalignment between vision-language and action spaces.

Paradoxically though, in many scenarios the\nnaive addition of macro-actions does not lead to better exploration, but rather\nthe opposite. It has been argued that this was caused by adding non-useful\nmacros and multiple works have focused on mechanisms to discover effectively\nenvironment-specific useful macros. In this work, we take a slightly different\nperspective. We argue that the difficulty stems from the trade-offs between\nreducing the average number of decisions per episode versus increasing the size\nof the action space. Namely, one typically treats each potential macro-action\nas independent and atomic, hence strictly increasing the search space and\nmaking typical exploration strategies inefficient. To address this problem we\npropose a novel regularization term that exploits the relationship between\nactions and macro-actions to improve the credit assignment mechanism by\nreducing the effective dimension of the action space and, therefore, improving\nexploration. The term relies on a similarity matrix that is meta-learned\njointly with learning the desired policy. We empirically validate our strategy\nlooking at macro-actions in Atari games, and the StreetFighter II environment.\nOur results show significant improvements over the Rainbow-DQN baseline in all\nenvironments. Additionally, we show that the macro-action similarity is\ntransferable to related environments.
