### [1] [McBE: A Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02088)
*Tian Lan,Xiangdong Su,Xu Liu,Ruirui Wang,Ke Chang,Jiang Li,Guanglai Gao*

Key words: 大语言模型, 偏见评估, 中文文化, 多任务基准, 伦理风险

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多任务中文偏见评估基准（McBE），用于全面评估大语言模型（LLM）中的偏见，填补了中文文化背景下偏见评估数据集的空白。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）在各类NLP任务中的应用增多，其内在偏见逐渐显现。现有偏见评估数据集多关注英语和北美文化，且难以适用于其他文化（如中文），亟需一个支持多任务评估的综合数据集。

Method: 研究团队构建了McBE基准，包含4,077个偏见评估实例，涵盖12个主要偏见类别、82个子类别，并引入5种评估任务，以提供广泛的类别覆盖和内容多样性。

Result: 对多个不同系列和参数规模的流行LLM进行评估，发现这些模型均表现出不同程度的偏见。

Conclusion: McBE基准为LLM偏见评估提供了全面的中文数据集，揭示了偏见的多维性，为未来研究和模型改进提供了新见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP
tasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring
biases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing
bias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their
bias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets
grounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,
these datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate
the bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a
Multi-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias
evaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and
introducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content
diversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several
popular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all
these LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth
analysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Reasoning or Not? A Comprehensive Evaluation of Reasoning LLMs for Dialogue Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02145)
*Keyan Jin,Yapeng Wang,Leonel Santos,Tao Fang,Xu Yang,Sio Kei Im,Hugo Gonçalo Oliveira*

Key words: 对话摘要、大语言模型、推理型LLMs、非推理型LLMs、评价标准

TL;DR: 长篇思维链（CoT）在对话摘要任务中表现不佳，非推理型大语言模型（LLMs）反而更优。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨推理型与非推理型LLMs在对话摘要任务中的表现差异，特别是在需要同时兼顾抽象与简洁的场景中。

Method: 对推理型和非推理型LLMs在三种对话摘要范式（通用、角色导向、查询导向）上进行系统评估，涵盖多语言、多领域和不同摘要长度，并采用LLM自动指标和人工标准。

Result: 研究发现，推理型LLMs在对话摘要中表现不佳，易冗长、不一致且不够简洁；非推理型LLMs更优。

Conclusion: 当前推理型LLMs在对话摘要中存在局限性，需针对性建模和评估策略。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization is a challenging task with significant practical value
in customer service, meeting analysis, and conversational AI. Although large
language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in summarization
tasks, the performance of step-by-step reasoning architectures-specifically
Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementations such as OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1-remains unexplored for dialogue scenarios requiring concurrent
abstraction and conciseness. In this work, we present the first comprehensive
and systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs and non-reasoning
LLMs across three major paradigms-generic, role-oriented, and query-oriented
dialogue summarization. Our study spans diverse languages, domains, and summary
lengths, leveraging strong benchmarks (SAMSum, DialogSum, CSDS, and QMSum) and
advanced evaluation protocols that include both LLM-based automatic metrics and
human-inspired criteria. Contrary to trends in other reasoning-intensive tasks,
our findings show that explicit stepwise reasoning does not consistently
improve dialogue summarization quality. Instead, reasoning LLMs are often prone
to verbosity, factual inconsistencies, and less concise summaries compared to
their non-reasoning counterparts. Through scenario-specific analyses and
detailed case studies, we further identify when and why explicit reasoning may
fail to benefit-or even hinder-summarization in complex dialogue contexts. Our
work provides new insights into the limitations of current reasoning LLMs and
highlights the need for targeted modeling and evaluation strategies for
real-world dialogue summarization.

### [3] [Latent Chain-of-Thought? Decoding the Depth-Recurrent Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02199)
*Wenquan Lu,Yuechuan Yang,Kyle Lee,Yanshu Li,Enqi Liu*

Key words: 思维链推理, Huginn-3.5B, 隐空间推理, 可解释性, 循环Transformer

TL;DR: 本文研究了Huginn-3.5B模型是否能在隐空间中形成类似思维链（CoT）的推理结构，发现其隐式推理的可解释性有限且存在不一致性，且在效率上不及显式推理模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探索深度循环Transformer模型是否能内化推理过程，以提升效率，同时保持推理的可解释性。

Method: 使用Logit Lens和Coda Lens等技术对Huginn-3.5B模型在算术任务中的内部行为进行分析。

Result: 隐式思维链推理的可解释性证据有限，且在不同循环块中表现不一致；增加循环深度带来的收益有限。

Conclusion: 隐式推理在效率和可解释性上不及显式推理，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled transformer-based language
models to excel at complex mathematics and multi-step planning. However, in
standard decoder-only architectures, these reasoning steps are externalized in
natural language, improving interpretability at the cost of efficiency. To
capture reasoning that is not easily represented in words, many works have
explored recurrent architectures that aim to internalize reasoning in latent
space, potentially supporting latent CoT. In this paper, we investigate whether
such reasoning structures emerge in Huginn-3.5B, a depth-recurrent Transformer
that reuses layers at inference time without increasing parameter count. We
examine the model's internal behavior on arithmetic tasks using a suite of
probing techniques including the Logit Lens and Coda Lens. Our findings reveal
limited evidence of interpretable latent CoT by tracking rank trajectories of
final and intermediate result tokens. Furthermore, we uncover significant
probing inconsistencies across recurrent blocks, where the interpretability of
hidden states depends heavily on both the layer index and the decoding method.
Finally, we empirically show that increasing recurrence depth yields only
marginal gains and falls well short of models that explicitly externalize
reasoning steps. The code is available at

### [4] [GDC Cohort Copilot: An AI Copilot for Curating Cohorts from the Genomic Data Commons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02221)
*Steven Song,Anirudh Subramanyam,Zhenyu Zhang,Aarti Venkat,Robert L. Grossman*

Key words: GDC, 队列构建, 自然语言处理, 大型语言模型, 开源工具

TL;DR: GDC Cohort Copilot是一个开源工具，通过自然语言描述帮助用户在GDC中创建复杂队列，并证明其本地LLM模型优于GPT-4。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: GDC用户（尤其是新手）在数百个字段中查找特定队列描述符时可能遇到困难，因此需要一个自然语言工具简化流程。

Method: 开发了一个开源工具GDC Cohort Copilot，利用LLM模型将自然语言描述转换为GDC队列过滤器，并提供交互界面供用户细化。

Result: 本地部署的开源GDC Cohort LLM在生成GDC队列方面表现优于GPT-4。

Conclusion: GDC Cohort Copilot通过自然语言交互显著提升了队列创建的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Motivation: The Genomic Data Commons (GDC) provides access to high quality,
harmonized cancer genomics data through a unified curation and analysis
platform centered around patient cohorts. While GDC users can interactively
create complex cohorts through the graphical Cohort Builder, users (especially
new ones) may struggle to find specific cohort descriptors across hundreds of
possible fields and properties. However, users may be better able to describe
their desired cohort in free-text natural language.
  Results: We introduce GDC Cohort Copilot, an open-source copilot tool for
curating cohorts from the GDC. GDC Cohort Copilot automatically generates the
GDC cohort filter corresponding to a user-input natural language description of
their desired cohort, before exporting the cohort back to the GDC for further
analysis. An interactive user interface allows users to further refine the
generated cohort. We develop and evaluate multiple large language models (LLMs)
for GDC Cohort Copilot and demonstrate that our locally-served, open-source GDC
Cohort LLM achieves better results than GPT-4o prompting in generating GDC
cohorts.
  Availability and implementation: The standalone docker image for GDC Cohort
Copilot is available at https://quay.io/repository/cdis/gdc-cohort-copilot.

### [5] [MemAgent: Reshaping Long-Context LLM with Multi-Conv RL-based Memory Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02259)
*Hongli Yu,Tinghong Chen,Jiangtao Feng,Jiangjie Chen,Weinan Dai,Qiying Yu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Wei-Ying Ma,Jingjing Liu,Mingxuan Wang,Hao Zhou*

Key words: 长文本处理, MemAgent, 端到端优化, DAPO算法, 记忆更新

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MemAgent的新工作流，通过分段读取文本并更新记忆，优化长文本任务处理，展示了出色的长上下文能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 长文本处理中，如何在无限长的文档中保持线性复杂度且性能不衰减是核心挑战。

Method: 采用端到端优化，提出MemAgent工作流，通过分段读取和记忆更新策略，扩展DAPO算法以支持多对话生成训练。

Result: MemAgent在8K上下文中训练后能扩展到3.5M QA任务，性能损失<5%，并在512K RULER测试中达到95%+。

Conclusion: MemAgent在长文本任务中表现出色，为长上下文处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite improvements by length extrapolation, efficient attention and memory
modules, handling infinitely long documents with linear complexity without
performance degradation during extrapolation remains the ultimate challenge in
long-text processing. We directly optimize for long-text tasks in an end-to-end
fashion and introduce a novel agent workflow, MemAgent, which reads text in
segments and updates the memory using an overwrite strategy. We extend the DAPO
algorithm to facilitate training via independent-context multi-conversation
generation. MemAgent has demonstrated superb long-context capabilities, being
able to extrapolate from an 8K context trained on 32K text to a 3.5M QA task
with performance loss < 5% and achieves 95%+ in 512K RULER test.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为DoMIX的新方法，解决了现有持续DAP方法的高计算成本、对增量数据顺序敏感以及提供单一通用模型的局限性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有持续DAP方法存在高计算成本、数据顺序敏感和提供通用模型的问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用LoRA模块（一种参数高效微调方法）实现高效、并行的领域自适应预训练，且对领域顺序稳健。

Result: DoMIX能够有效利用累积知识，为特定任务提供定制化的预训练模型，并可扩展至标准LLM微调场景。

Conclusion: DoMIX通过LoRA模块解决了现有持续DAP方法的不足，在效率和适应性上表现优异。

Abstract: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/dohoonkim-ai/DoMIX.

### [8] [QFFN-BERT: An Empirical Study of Depth, Performance, and Data Efficiency in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02364)
*Pilsung Kang*

Key words: QFFN-BERT, PQC, Transformer, 量子计算, 少样本学习

TL;DR: QFFN-BERT是一种混合量子-经典Transformer，用参数化量子电路（PQCs）替代传统BERT中的前馈网络（FFN），显著减少参数数量并在某些情况下超越经典模型的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究发现FFN在标准Transformer编码器中占据大部分参数，希望通过量子计算提高参数效率和模型表现。

Method: 设计了一种包含残余连接、RY和RZ旋转以及交替纠缠策略的PQC架构，并在SST-2和DBpedia基准测试中进行实验。

Result: QFFN-BERT在完整数据设置下达到基线准确率的102%，且减少FFN参数99%；在少样本学习中表现稳定。

Conclusion: PQCs可作为经典FFN的高效替代方案，结合深度学习原理设计后表现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have recently emerged as promising
components for enhancing the expressibility of neural architectures. In this
work, we introduce QFFN-BERT, a hybrid quantum-classical transformer where the
feedforward network (FFN) modules of a compact BERT variant are replaced by
PQC-based layers. This design is motivated by the dominant parameter
contribution of FFNs, which account for approximately two-thirds of the
parameters within standard Transformer encoder blocks. While prior studies have
primarily integrated PQCs into self-attention modules, our work focuses on the
FFN and systematically investigates the trade-offs between PQC depth,
expressibility, and trainability. Our final PQC architecture incorporates a
residual connection, both $R_Y$ and $R_Z$ rotations, and an alternating
entanglement strategy to ensure stable training and high expressibility. Our
experiments, conducted on a classical simulator, on the SST-2 and DBpedia
benchmarks demonstrate two key findings. First, a carefully configured
QFFN-BERT achieves up to 102.0% of the baseline accuracy, surpassing its
classical counterpart in a full-data setting while reducing FFN-specific
parameters by over 99%. Second, our model exhibits a consistent and competitive
edge in few-shot learning scenarios, confirming its potential for superior data
efficiency. These results, supported by an ablation study on a non-optimized
PQC that failed to learn, confirm that PQCs can serve as powerful and
parameter-efficient alternatives to classical FFNs when co-designed with
foundational deep learning principles.

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了一种利用参数模型选择代码数据的方法，以提高训练效率和模型性能。通过确保数据子集的分布一致性和多样性，该方法在仅使用10K样本的情况下，性能优于全采样基线和其他采样方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）在代码生成和程序理解方面表现优异，但现有方法通常过度依赖数据量而忽视数据质量，导致训练效率降低。

Method: 提出了一种利用参数模型选择代码数据的方法，通过优化参数模型以确保所选子集的分布一致性和多样性。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅使用10K样本时，该方法在HumanEval和MBPP上的性能分别提升了2.4%和2.3%，优于其他采样方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升模型性能，同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved code generation and program comprehension, accelerating the evolution
of software engineering. Current methods primarily enhance model performance by
leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often
overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address
this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data
selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance.
Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency
and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data.
Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method
achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled
baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and
efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model
performance while significantly reducing computational costs.

### [10] [Benchmarking Akan ASR Models Across Domain-Specific Datasets: A Comparative Evaluation of Performance, Scalability, and Adaptability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02407)
*Mark Atta Mensah,Isaac Wiafe,Akon Ekpezu,Justice Kwame Appati,Jamal-Deen Abdulai,Akosua Nyarkoa Wiafe-Akenten,Frank Ernest Yeboah,Gifty Odame*

Key words: ASR, Transformer, 跨领域, 低资源语言, Whisper, Wav2Vec2

TL;DR: 该研究评估了七种基于Transformer架构的Akan ASR模型在多个领域的表现，发现模型在跨领域时性能下降，并揭示了不同架构在错误行为上的差异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有ASR研究多局限于单一领域评估，缺乏对跨领域泛化能力的探讨。

Method: 使用四种Akan语音语料库，比较Whisper和Wav2Vec2等模型的词错误率和字符错误率。

Result: 模型仅在训练领域表现最优，跨领域时性能显著下降；Whisper和Wav2Vec2在错误行为上存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 针对低资源语言ASR，需考虑领域适应技术和架构选择的权衡。

Abstract: Most existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) research evaluate models
using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

Abstract: This study presents an approach for collecting speech samples to build
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for impaired speech, particularly,
low-resource languages. It aims to democratize ASR technology and data
collection by developing a "cookbook" of best practices and training for
community-driven data collection and ASR model building. As a proof-of-concept,
this study curated the first open-source dataset of impaired speech in Akan: a
widely spoken indigenous language in Ghana. The study involved participants
from diverse backgrounds with speech impairments. The resulting dataset, along
with the cookbook and open-source tools, are publicly available to enable
researchers and practitioners to create inclusive ASR technologies tailored to
the unique needs of speech impaired individuals. In addition, this study
presents the initial results of fine-tuning open-source ASR models to better
recognize impaired speech in Akan.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 突破人类认知限制是LLM训练的关键前沿。开源模型在复杂信息搜索任务中表现不佳，而专有代理如DeepResearch已展现出超人类能力。

Method: 通过结构化采样和信息模糊化生成高不确定性任务，采用RFT冷启动和DUPO优化策略进行训练。

Result: WebSailor 在复杂信息搜索任务中显著超越所有开源代理，匹配专有代理性能。

Conclusion: WebSailor 成功缩小了开源模型与专有代理之间的能力差距。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Result: 提出了一个理论框架，将HLV融入主动学习过程，并讨论了大型语言模型（LLM）作为标注者的整合。

Conclusion: 研究为HLV感知的主动学习奠定了理论基础，更好地反映了现实世界标注的复杂性。

Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

Motivation: 响应LLMs偏见缓解的需求，提出一种无需大量提示工程或微调的可扩展方法。

Method: 基于SAGED管道，利用多视角生成分解基线分布，通过采样和平衡权重对齐LLM输出。

Result: MPF能够对齐LLM情感分布，降低校准误差，并泛化到未见过的问题。

Conclusion: MPF为LLM偏见缓解提供了一种可扩展、可解释的方法，适用于已部署的模型。

Abstract: Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

Abstract: Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of
publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive
process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential
to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations,
remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation
types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for
studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement
human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a
synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of
high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written
limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we
augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding
identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the
capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers,
enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示人类在元音模仿中的控制机制，特别是对听觉空间目标区域的准确性控制程度。

Method: 采用元音模仿范式，测量两组英语使用者在模仿前元音时的JPD。

Result: JPD的范围为14至51 mels，这一结果有助于理解语音产生中的控制机制及元音系统的结构。

Conclusion: 研究为语音产生的片段理论提供了依据，并为元音系统的结构和可能的音素数量设置了理论下限。

Abstract: A body of work over the past several decades has demonstrated that the
complex and coordinated articulatory movements of human vowel production are
governed (at least in part)by control mechanisms whose targets are regions of
auditory space. Within the target region control at the sub-phonemic level has
also been demonstrated. But the degree of accuracy of that control is unknown.
The current work investigates this question by asking how far apart must two
vowel stimuli lie in auditory space in order to yield reliably different
imitations? This distance is termed 'Just Producible Difference' (JPD). The
current study uses a vowel mimicry paradigm to derive the first measurement of
JPD among two sets of English speakers during front vowel production. JPD is
estimated at between 14 and 51 mels in F1 X F2 space. This finding has
implications for episodic theories of speech production. It also clarifies the
possible structures of human vowel systems, by setting a theoretical lower
bound for how close two vowel phonemes may be in a speaker's formant space, and
hence a psychophysical explanation of observed trends in number and patterns of
possible vowel phonemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: LLMs虽然强大，但仍存在错误，自我纠错是其可信赖性的关键能力。研究发现LLMs在自我纠错上存在系统性盲点，亟待改进。

Method: 通过引入Self-Correction Bench框架，在三种复杂度级别上注入控制错误，测试了14个模型的自我纠错能力。

Result: 平均盲点率为64.5%，发现训练数据组成是主要原因；简单添加“Wait”可将盲点减少89.3%。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs存在关键局限性，但通过改进训练方法（如增加纠错示范）或简单提示可提升其可靠性和可信度。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still
make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 尽管推理语言模型在复杂任务中表现出色，但其对社会偏见的鲁棒性影响尚不明确。研究旨在评估推理能力对模型公平性和安全性的影响。

Method: 利用CLEAR-Bias基准测试，通过LLM作为评判的自动化安全评分和越狱技术，系统评估RLMs在不同社会文化维度的表现。

Result: 研究发现，具有明确推理能力的模型更容易被偏见诱导，尤其是通过CoT提示的模型；推理能力并未如预期提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了推理能力自然提升鲁棒性的假设，强调需要在推理设计中加入更多偏见意识。

Abstract: Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) have gained traction for their ability to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning tasks through mechanisms such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces. While these
capabilities promise improved reliability, their impact on robustness to social
biases remains unclear. In this work, we leverage the CLEAR-Bias benchmark,
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), to investigate the
adversarial robustness of RLMs to bias elicitation. We systematically evaluate
state-of-the-art RLMs across diverse sociocultural dimensions, using an
LLM-as-a-judge approach for automated safety scoring and leveraging jailbreak
techniques to assess the strength of built-in safety mechanisms. Our evaluation
addresses three key questions: (i) how the introduction of reasoning
capabilities affects model fairness and robustness; (ii) whether models
fine-tuned for reasoning exhibit greater safety than those relying on CoT
prompting at inference time; and (iii) how the success rate of jailbreak
attacks targeting bias elicitation varies with the reasoning mechanisms
employed. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between reasoning
capabilities and bias safety. Surprisingly, models with explicit reasoning,
whether via CoT prompting or fine-tuned reasoning traces, are generally more
vulnerable to bias elicitation than base models without such mechanisms,
suggesting reasoning may unintentionally open new pathways for stereotype
reinforcement. Reasoning-enabled models appear somewhat safer than those
relying on CoT prompting, which are particularly prone to contextual reframing
attacks through storytelling prompts, fictional personas, or reward-shaped
instructions. These results challenge the assumption that reasoning inherently
improves robustness and underscore the need for more bias-aware approaches to
reasoning design.

Result: Qwen-VL-DP在MathVista和Math-V基准测试中显著优于现有模型，展现了准确性和生成多样性的提升。

Conclusion: 多样化的推理视角和反思性推理对多模态数学推理至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially
in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and
single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning
perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a
novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each
image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose
Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and
enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL
approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward
functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives
and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive
experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that
Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and
generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse
perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.

Method: 提出基于机器学习的动态路由框架SynapseRoute，根据问题复杂度分配查询至思考或非思考模式。

Result: 实验表明，SynapseRoute在多个医疗数据集上不仅提升准确性（0.8390 vs. 0.8272），还减少推理时间36.8%、令牌消耗39.66%。

Conclusion: 动态路由避免了简单问题的过度推理带来的负面影响，并通过AIT指数全面评估准确性、延迟与令牌成本的权衡。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

Conclusion: 通过新基准和RLVR训练，模型在遵循复杂指令方面的泛化能力得到显著提升。

Abstract: A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of
language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common
feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or
no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to
craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with
fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a
small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these
abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to
generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark,
IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new,
diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we
perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to
improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we
carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction
following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated
training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and
code.

Motivation: 揭示语言模型在用户反馈训练中的安全漏洞，探讨其对模型行为的影响。

Method: 攻击者通过提示模型生成“中毒”或良性响应，并通过点赞或点踩反馈影响后续偏好调整。

Result: 模型在无恶意提示的上下文中更可能生成中毒响应，可用于插入虚假知识、修改代码或注入虚假新闻。

Conclusion: 研究不仅揭示了用户反馈训练的新攻击机制，还展示了偏好调整对模型行为的细致控制能力。

Abstract: We describe a vulnerability in language models (LMs) trained with user
feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

Conclusion: MOTIF通过模块化思考和多轮强化学习，有效扩展了LLM的推理能力，且具有较高的样本效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code

Conclusion: 生成式评估优于选择题评估，建议从选择题转向答案匹配。

Abstract: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

Conclusion: LDSolver在粗网格上高效准确地模拟流体流动，显著优于基线模型，具有优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Simulation of fluid flows is crucial for modeling physical phenomena like
meteorology, aerodynamics, and biomedicine. Classical numerical solvers often
require fine spatiotemporal grids to satisfy stability, consistency, and
convergence conditions, leading to substantial computational costs. Although
machine learning has demonstrated better efficiency, they typically suffer from
issues of interpretability, generalizability, and data dependency. Hence, we
propose a learnable and differentiable finite volume solver, called LDSolver,
designed for efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flows on spatiotemporal
coarse grids. LDSolver comprises two key components: (1) a differentiable
finite volume solver, and (2) an learnable module providing equivalent
approximation for fluxes (derivatives and interpolations), and temporal error
correction on coarse grids. Even with limited training data (e.g., only a few
trajectories), our model could accelerate the simulation while maintaining a
high accuracy with superior generalizability. Experiments on different flow
systems (e.g., Burgers, decaying, forced and shear flows) show that LDSolver
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing baseline models with notable
margins.

Abstract: Accurate traffic demand forecasting enables transportation management
departments to allocate resources more effectively, thereby improving their
utilization efficiency. However, complex spatiotemporal relationships in
traffic systems continue to limit the performance of demand forecasting models.
To improve the accuracy of spatiotemporal traffic demand prediction, we propose
a new graph convolutional network structure called DKGCM. Specifically, we
first consider the spatial flow distribution of different traffic nodes and
propose a novel temporal similarity-based clustering graph convolution method,
DK-GCN. This method utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and K-means clustering
to group traffic nodes and more effectively capture spatial dependencies. On
the temporal scale, we integrate the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) within the
bidirectional Mamba deep learning framework to capture temporal dependencies in
traffic demand. To further optimize model training, we incorporate the GRPO
reinforcement learning strategy to enhance the loss function feedback
mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms several
advanced methods and achieves strong results on three public datasets.

Abstract: Amid a tidal wave of misinformation flooding social media during elections
and crises, extensive research has been conducted on misinformation detection,
primarily focusing on text-based or image-based approaches. However, only a few
studies have explored multimodal feature combinations, such as integrating text
and images for building a classification model to detect misinformation. This
study investigates the effectiveness of different multimodal feature
combinations, incorporating text, images, and social features using an early
fusion approach for the classification model. This study analyzed 1,529 tweets
containing both text and images during the COVID-19 pandemic and election
periods collected from Twitter (now X). A data enrichment process was applied
to extract additional social features, as well as visual features, through
techniques such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
The results show that combining unsupervised and supervised machine learning
models improves classification performance by 15% compared to unimodal models
and by 5% compared to bimodal models. Additionally, the study analyzes the
propagation patterns of misinformation based on the characteristics of
misinformation tweets and the users who disseminate them.

Abstract: Selecting relevant features is an important and necessary step for
intelligent machines to maximize their chances of success. However, intelligent
machines generally have no enough computing resources when faced with huge
volume of data. This paper develops a new method based on sampling techniques
and rough set theory to address the challenge of feature selection for massive
data. To this end, this paper proposes using the ratio of discernible object
pairs to all object pairs that should be distinguished to measure the
discriminatory ability of a feature set. Based on this measure, a new feature
selection method is proposed. This method constructs positive region preserved
samples from massive data to find a feature subset with high discriminatory
ability. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has two advantages.
First, it is able to select a feature subset that can preserve the
discriminatory ability of all the features of the target massive data set
within an acceptable time on a personal computer. Second, the lower boundary of
the probability of the object pairs that can be discerned using the feature
subset selected in all object pairs that should be distinguished can be
estimated before finding reducts. Furthermore, 11 data sets of different sizes
were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that approximate
reducts can be found in a very short period of time, and the discriminatory
ability of the final reduct is larger than the estimated lower boundary.
Experiments on four large-scale data sets also showed that an approximate
reduct with high discriminatory ability can be obtained in reasonable time on a
personal computer.

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex process, characterized by
thousands of interdependent parameters collected across diverse tools and
process steps. Multi-variate time-series (MTS) analysis has emerged as a
critical methodology for enabling real-time monitoring, fault detection, and
predictive maintenance in such environments. However, anomaly prediction in
semiconductor fabrication presents several critical challenges, including high
data dimensionality, severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults,
noisy and missing measurements, and non-stationary behavior of production
systems. Furthermore, the complex interdependencies between variables and the
delayed emergence of faults across downstream stages complicate both anomaly
detection and root-cause-analysis. This paper presents a novel and generic
approach for anomaly detection in MTS data using machine learning. The proposed
methodology consists of three main steps: a) converting MTS data into
image-based representations using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, b)
developing a multi-class image classifier by fine-tuning a pretrained VGG-16
architecture on custom CWT image datasets, and c) constructing a Siamese
network composed of two identical sub-networks, each utilizing the fine-tuned
VGG-16 as a backbone. The network takes pairs of CWT images as input -one
serving as a reference or anchor (representing a known-good signal), and the
other as a query (representing an unknown signal). The model then compares the
embeddings of both inputs to determine whether they belong to the same class at
a given time step. Our approach demonstrates high accuracy in identifying
anomalies on a real FAB process time-series dataset, offering a promising
solution for offline anomaly detection in process and tool trace data.
Moreover, the approach is flexible and can be applied in both supervised and
semi-supervised settings.

Result: 在4个不同的视频问答数据集上取得最先进的结果，尤其在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过推理时计算的高效选择，显著提升了长视频问答的准确性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), long-video
understanding remains a challenging problem. Although state-of-the-art
long-context VLMs can process around 1000 input frames, they still struggle to
effectively leverage this sequence length, and succumb to irrelevant
distractors within the context window. We present Temporal Chain of Thought, an
inference strategy for video question-answering that curates the model's input
context. We use the VLM itself to iteratively identify and extract the most
relevant frames from the video, which are then used for answering. We
demonstrate how leveraging more computation at inference-time to select the
most relevant context leads to improvements in accuracy, in agreement with
recent work on inference-time scaling of LLMs. Moreover, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on 4 diverse video question-answering datasets,
showing consistent improvements with 3 different VLMs. In particular, our
method shines on longer videos which would not otherwise fit within the model's
context window: On longer videos of more than 1 hour on LVBench, our approach
using a context window of 32K outperforms the same VLM using standard inference
with a 700K context window by 2.8 points.

Conclusion: AIRES通过算法和系统协同优化，显著提升了外核SpGEMM的性能，为大规模图处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are fundamental in various scientific
applications, ranging from biomedical protein-protein interactions (PPI) to
large-scale recommendation systems. An essential component for modeling graph
structures in GCNs is sparse general matrix-matrix multiplication (SpGEMM). As
the size of graph data continues to scale up, SpGEMMs are often conducted in an
out-of-core fashion due to limited GPU memory space in resource-constrained
systems. Albeit recent efforts that aim to alleviate the memory constraints of
out-of-core SpGEMM through either GPU feature caching, hybrid CPU-GPU memory
layout, or performing the computation in sparse format, current systems suffer
from both high I/O latency and GPU under-utilization issues.
  In this paper, we first identify the problems of existing systems, where
sparse format data alignment and memory allocation are the main performance
bottlenecks, and propose AIRES, a novel algorithm-system co-design solution to
accelerate out-of-core SpGEMM computation for GCNs. Specifically, from the
algorithm angle, AIRES proposes to alleviate the data alignment issues on the
block level for matrices in sparse formats and develops a tiling algorithm to
facilitate row block-wise alignment. On the system level, AIRES employs a
three-phase dynamic scheduling that features a dual-way data transfer strategy
utilizing a tiered memory system: integrating GPU memory, GPU Direct Storage
(GDS), and host memory to reduce I/O latency and improve throughput.
Evaluations show that AIRES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 1.8x lower latency in real-world graph processing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: GeoAda在保持模型几何一致性的同时，实现了高效的微调性能。

Abstract: Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular
dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for
downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables
flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks
without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a
structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling
operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model
layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an
equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight
adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while
mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that
the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric
inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during
adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse
geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph
control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics,
molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical
results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance
while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience
significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic
forgetting.

Motivation: 探索在招聘中如何平衡AI模型的准确性和公平性，避免通用LLM因预训练偏差而传播社会偏见。

Method: 通过多种指标（ROC AUC、Precision-Recall AUC、F1-score和公平性比率）评估LLM和Match Score在1万份真实招聘数据上的表现。

Result: Match Score在准确性（ROC AUC 0.85）和公平性（最小种族影响比率0.957）上显著优于LLM。

Conclusion: 专用模型能同时实现高准确性和公平性，强调在高风险领域（如招聘）需定制化模型和严格偏差审核。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline
candidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and
algorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we
benchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our
proprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate
matching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,
Precision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis
across declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on
a dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that
Match Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs
0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic
groups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957
(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the
intersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause
LLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring
scenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate
these biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling
and bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and
caution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive
fairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there
shouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a
well-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in
outcomes.

Result: 在放松约束条件下，样本复杂度为$	ilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$；严格约束条件下，为$	ilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在表格式CMDP中展现了近优的样本复杂度，适用于多种约束条件。

Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov
decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that
maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative
constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with
a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP
solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the
framework by using mirror descent value iteration
(\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We
provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases:
(i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and
(ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy
the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note
that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and
$\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples,
where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the
size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular
CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities
in this setting.

Result: EBTs在训练和推理中表现优于主流Transformer++方法，数据、批量大小等指标上提升35%，语言任务性能提升29%，图像去噪优于Diffusion Transformers。

Conclusion: EBTs是一种有潜力的新范式，能同时提升模型的学习和思考能力，且在相同或更差预训练性能下优于现有方法。

Abstract: Inference-time computation techniques, analogous to human System 2 Thinking,
have recently become popular for improving model performances. However, most
existing approaches suffer from several limitations: they are modality-specific
(e.g., working only in text), problem-specific (e.g., verifiable domains like
math and coding), or require additional supervision/training on top of
unsupervised pretraining (e.g., verifiers or verifiable rewards). In this
paper, we ask the question "Is it possible to generalize these System 2
Thinking approaches, and develop models that learn to think solely from
unsupervised learning?" Interestingly, we find the answer is yes, by learning
to explicitly verify the compatibility between inputs and
candidate-predictions, and then re-framing prediction problems as optimization
with respect to this verifier. Specifically, we train Energy-Based Transformers
(EBTs) -- a new class of Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- to assign an energy
value to every input and candidate-prediction pair, enabling predictions
through gradient descent-based energy minimization until convergence. Across
both discrete (text) and continuous (visual) modalities, we find EBTs scale
faster than the dominant Transformer++ approach during training, achieving an
up to 35% higher scaling rate with respect to data, batch size, parameters,
FLOPs, and depth. During inference, EBTs improve performance with System 2
Thinking by 29% more than the Transformer++ on language tasks, and EBTs
outperform Diffusion Transformers on image denoising while using fewer forward
passes. Further, we find that EBTs achieve better results than existing models
on most downstream tasks given the same or worse pretraining performance,
suggesting that EBTs generalize better than existing approaches. Consequently,
EBTs are a promising new paradigm for scaling both the learning and thinking
capabilities of models.

Conclusion: 揭示了计算最优训练的神经网络具有统一的缩放规律，为模型优化提供了实用指标。

Abstract: What scaling limits govern neural network training dynamics when model size
and training time grow in tandem? We show that despite the complex interactions
between architecture, training algorithms, and data, compute-optimally trained
models exhibit a remarkably precise universality. Specifically, loss curves
from models of varying sizes collapse onto a single universal curve when
training compute and loss are normalized to unity at the end of training. With
learning rate decay, the collapse becomes so tight that differences in the
normalized curves across models fall below the noise floor of individual loss
curves across random seeds, a phenomenon we term supercollapse. We observe
supercollapse across learning rate schedules, datasets, and architectures,
including transformers trained on next-token prediction, and find it breaks
down when hyperparameters are scaled suboptimally, providing a precise and
practical indicator of good scaling. We explain these phenomena by connecting
collapse to the power-law structure in typical neural scaling laws, and
analyzing a simple yet surprisingly effective model of SGD noise dynamics that
accurately predicts loss curves across various learning rate schedules and
quantitatively explains the origin of supercollapse.

Abstract: Modern very large-scale integration (VLSI) design requires the implementation
of integrated circuits using electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Due to
the complexity of EDA algorithms, the vast parameter space poses a huge
challenge to chip design optimization, as the combination of even moderate
numbers of parameters creates an enormous solution space to explore. Manual
parameter selection remains industrial practice despite being excessively
laborious and limited by expert experience. To address this issue, we present
CROP, the first large language model (LLM)-powered automatic VLSI design flow
tuning framework. Our approach includes: (1) a scalable methodology for
transforming RTL source code into dense vector representations, (2) an
embedding-based retrieval system for matching designs with semantically similar
circuits, and (3) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enhanced LLM-guided
parameter search system that constrains the search process with prior knowledge
from similar designs. Experiment results demonstrate CROP's ability to achieve
superior quality-of-results (QoR) with fewer iterations than existing
approaches on industrial designs, including a 9.9% reduction in power
consumption.

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated strong performance in conditional

serves as a compact representation. However, their limited controllability and
reconstruction accuracy restrict their practical application to data
compression. In this work, we propose an efficient latent diffusion framework
that bridges this gap by combining a variational autoencoder with a conditional
diffusion model. Our method compresses only a small number of keyframes into
latent space and uses them as conditioning inputs to reconstruct the remaining
frames via generative interpolation, eliminating the need to store latent
representations for every frame. This approach enables accurate spatiotemporal
reconstruction while significantly reducing storage costs. Experimental results
across multiple datasets show that our method achieves up to 10 times higher
compression ratios than rule-based state-of-the-art compressors such as SZ3,
and up to 63 percent better performance than leading learning-based methods
under the same reconstruction error.

Result: 在多个真实时序图数据集上表现优异，如WIKI数据集预测集大小减少31%，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: NCPNET在动态图中确保了统计覆盖，并提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Conformal prediction for graph neural networks (GNNs) offers a promising
framework for quantifying uncertainty, enhancing GNN reliability in high-stakes
applications. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graphs,
neglecting the evolving nature of real-world graphs. Temporal dependencies in
graph structure, node attributes, and ground truth labels violate the
fundamental exchangeability assumption of standard conformal prediction
methods, limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we introduce NCPNET, a novel end-to-end conformal prediction framework
tailored for temporal graphs. Our approach extends conformal prediction to
dynamic settings, mitigating statistical coverage violations induced by
temporal dependencies. To achieve this, we propose a diffusion-based
non-conformity score that captures both topological and temporal uncertainties
within evolving networks. Additionally, we develop an efficiency-aware
optimization algorithm that improves the conformal prediction process,
enhancing computational efficiency and reducing coverage violations. Extensive
experiments on diverse real-world temporal graphs, including WIKI, REDDIT,
DBLP, and IBM Anti-Money Laundering dataset, demonstrate NCPNET's capability to
ensure guaranteed coverage in temporal graphs, achieving up to a 31% reduction
in prediction set size on the WIKI dataset, significantly improving efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our data and code are available at

Conclusion: 该方法能提升模型安全性，支持错误概率估计和故障验证。

Abstract: Many safety failures in machine learning arise when models are used to assign
predictions to people (often in settings like lending, hiring, or content
moderation) without accounting for how individuals can change their inputs. In
this work, we introduce a formal validation procedure for the responsiveness of
predictions with respect to interventions on their features. Our procedure
frames responsiveness as a type of sensitivity analysis in which practitioners
control a set of changes by specifying constraints over interventions and
distributions over downstream effects. We describe how to estimate
responsiveness for the predictions of any model and any dataset using only
black-box access, and how to use these estimates to support tasks such as
falsification and failure probability estimation. We develop algorithms that
construct these estimates by generating a uniform sample of reachable points,
and demonstrate how they can promote safety in real-world applications such as
recidivism prediction, organ transplant prioritization, and content moderation.

Method: 基于度量指标的经验相关性进行聚类，减少重叠并选择代表性指标。

Result: 定量实验表明该流程提高了评估稳定性。

Conclusion: 新流程有效地减轻了评估偏见。

Abstract: Evaluating the accuracy of dimensionality reduction (DR) projections in
preserving the structure of high-dimensional data is crucial for reliable
visual analytics. Diverse evaluation metrics targeting different structural
characteristics have thus been developed. However, evaluations of DR
projections can become biased if highly correlated metrics--those measuring
similar structural characteristics--are inadvertently selected, favoring DR
techniques that emphasize those characteristics. To address this issue, we
propose a novel workflow that reduces bias in the selection of evaluation
metrics by clustering metrics based on their empirical correlations rather than
on their intended design characteristics alone. Our workflow works by computing
metric similarity using pairwise correlations, clustering metrics to minimize
overlap, and selecting a representative metric from each cluster. Quantitative
experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the stability of DR
evaluation, which indicates that our workflow contributes to mitigating
evaluation bias.

Motivation: 神经网络在解决偏微分方程（PDEs）时虽具有计算优势，但长期预测中误差会累积并导致物理失效，因此需要一种高效的校正方法。

Method: 提出了PhysicsCorrect框架，通过离线预计算Jacobian矩阵及其伪逆，将校正过程转化为线性化逆问题，显著提升效率。

Result: 在三个代表性PDE系统中，PhysicsCorrect将预测误差降低了100倍，同时推理时间增加不到5%。

Conclusion: PhysicsCorrect能够将不稳定的神经代理转化为可靠的仿真工具，平衡计算效率与物理保真度。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as powerful surrogates for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), offering significant computational speedups over
traditional methods. However, these models suffer from a critical limitation:
error accumulation during long-term rollouts, where small inaccuracies compound
exponentially, eventually causing complete divergence from physically valid
solutions. We present PhysicsCorrect, a training-free correction framework that
enforces PDE consistency at each prediction step by formulating correction as a
linearized inverse problem based on PDE residuals. Our key innovation is an
efficient caching strategy that precomputes the Jacobian and its pseudoinverse
during an offline warm-up phase, reducing computational overhead by two orders
of magnitude compared to standard correction approaches. Across three
representative PDE systems -- Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics, wave equations, and
the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation -- PhysicsCorrect reduces prediction
errors by up to 100x while adding negligible inference time (under 5\%). The
framework integrates seamlessly with diverse architectures including Fourier
Neural Operators, UNets, and Vision Transformers, effectively transforming
unstable neural surrogates into reliable simulation tools that bridge the gap
between deep learning's computational efficiency and the physical fidelity
demanded by practical scientific applications.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前机器学习领域存在大量性能相似但行为不同的模型，手动比较这些模型的差异成本高昂，亟需自动化方法辅助用户选择。

Method: 通过LLM对模型进行采样，生成差异的文本描述，并设计协议评估描述的准确性。同时构建了一个多样化的模型基准库。

Result: VERBA在决策树模型上能准确描述行为差异，初始准确率达80%，加入结构信息后提升至90%。

Conclusion: VERBA为提升机器学习模型的透明度和可比性提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the current machine learning landscape, we face a "model lake" phenomenon:
Given a task, there is a proliferation of trained models with similar
performances despite different behavior. For model users attempting to navigate
and select from the models, documentation comparing model pairs is helpful.
However, for every $N$ models there could be $O(N^2)$ pairwise comparisons, a
number prohibitive for the model developers to manually perform pairwise
comparisons and prepare documentations. To facilitate fine-grained pairwise
comparisons among models, we introduced $\textbf{VERBA}$. Our approach
leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate verbalizations of model
differences by sampling from the two models. We established a protocol that
evaluates the informativeness of the verbalizations via simulation. We also
assembled a suite with a diverse set of commonly used machine learning models
as a benchmark. For a pair of decision tree models with up to 5% performance
difference but 20-25% behavioral differences, $\textbf{VERBA}$ effectively
verbalizes their variations with up to 80% overall accuracy. When we included
the models' structural information, the verbalization's accuracy further
improved to 90%. $\textbf{VERBA}$ opens up new research avenues for improving
the transparency and comparability of machine learning models in a post-hoc
manner.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 网约车聚合平台的低价竞争机制促使服务提供商采用补贴策略，但目前缺乏动态适应市场波动并优化订单获取的方法。

Method: 结合快速竞争适应（FCA）和强化拉格朗日调整（RLA）技术，设计了FCA-RL框架，并引入了专用模拟环境RideGym进行评测。

Result: 实验表明，FCA-RL在多样市场条件下优于基线方法，有效优化了补贴策略。

Conclusion: FCA-RL为网约车服务提供商提供了一种动态适应市场并优化补贴的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of ride-hailing aggregator platforms presents significant
growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

Conclusion: URDP通过结合大语言模型的推理能力和贝叶斯优化的数值优化能力，解决了奖励设计中的核心挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: KGZS-SC网络通过知识图谱和零样本学习的结合，显著提升了语义通信的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Data-driven semantic communication is based on superficial statistical
patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统持续学习方法忽视数据流的动态性，无法应对概念漂移。本文旨在解决这一局限。

Method: 提出Adaptive Memory Realignment (AMR)，选择性更新记忆缓冲区以适应新分布，并通过新基准数据集验证。

Result: AMR在性能上与完全重新训练相当，同时大幅减少标注和计算需求。

Conclusion: AMR为非平稳持续学习提供了一种高效解决方案，兼顾稳定性和可塑性。

Abstract: Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

Method: 采用自蒸馏方法迭代优化基模型，使其逐步与目标分布对齐。

Result: 该方法显著提升了生成质量。

Conclusion: 自蒸馏是解决约束生成中稀疏奖励信号问题的有效手段。

Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive
language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

Conclusion: DeltaSHAP为临床时间序列提供高效、实时的解释工具，推动可解释AI在医疗领域的应用。

Abstract: This study proposes DeltaSHAP, a novel explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

Result: PANI与多种离线RL算法兼容，在多个基准测试中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: PANI为一简单有效的方法，可替代计算成本高的扩散模型，提升离线RL性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) optimizes a policy using only a fixed
dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Equalizer parameter optimization for signal integrity in high-speed Dynamic
Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis

equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

Motivation: 当前联邦图学习研究仅从结构角度处理子图联邦学习，忽视了图信号在空间和频谱域的传播问题，导致全局GNN的类知识下降和局部GNN的过拟合。

Method: 提出全局知识库以减少标签信号中断，并通过频率对齐解决频谱客户端漂移，两者结合形成S2FGL框架。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，S2FGL具有优越性能。

Conclusion: S2FGL通过空间和频谱策略有效提升了联邦图学习的全局泛化能力。

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

Result: 提出的InfinityKAN能够动态调整基函数数量，扩展了KANs的适用范围。

Conclusion: InfinityKAN通过自适应学习方法解决了KANs的关键限制，为表示学习提供了更灵活的框架。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

Conclusion: 两种序列下的性能存在显著差异，提出的算法在不同场景下实现了近乎最优的权衡。

Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 持续微调LLMs时，低秩适应（LoRA）效率高但表达能力受限。作者旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: GORP通过联合更新全参数和低秩参数，在统一低秩梯度子空间中优化，扩展优化空间并保持效率。

Result: 在持续学习基准测试中，GORP表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GORP有效解决了持续学习中的效率与表达性问题，并减轻了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了显著的分类性能提升，其中在BCI Competition IV的IV-1、IV-2A和IV-2B数据集上分别达到67.60%、65.96%和80.22%的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为无需校准的运动想象分类设立了新基准，并贡献了一个开放数据集推动领域研究。

Abstract: Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 当前文本到SQL任务主要依赖黑盒语言模型及其定制化组件，缺乏专门针对SQL的生成模型研究，自修正生成策略的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 通过为参考SQL查询准备推理步骤并人为制造错误数据，将其分为错误和修正步骤，用于持续预训练开源编码模型。

Result: 使用RetrySQL方法预训练的模型在执行准确性上比传统方法提升了4个百分点，且需要全参数预训练而非LoRA微调。

Conclusion: RetrySQL证明了自修正策略在文本到SQL任务中的有效性，为SQL导向的语言模型提供了一种新的提升生成准确性的方法。

Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

Result: 组合稀疏性是DNNs高效学习和泛化的基础，但关于其具体机制和学习优化的理论仍需完善。

Conclusion: 完善组合稀疏性在深度学习中的理论将推动对人工及通用智能的理解。

Abstract: Overparametrized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable
success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决在线部署中的两个主要挑战：目标模型与草稿模型不兼容以及随时间推移的延迟改进需求。

Method: 使用在线n-gram缓存和混合蒸馏微调，结合自适应草拟技术。

Result: OmniDraft使单个Llama-68M模型可与多种目标模型配对，速度提升达1.5-2倍。

Conclusion: OmniDraft适合设备端LLM应用，解决了模型成本、效率和用户定制化问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 探究层归一化在推理时的作用及其对模型可解释性的影响。

Method: 移除GPT-2模型中的所有LN层，并通过验证损失和可解释性技术评估影响。

Result: 移除LN层仅小幅增加损失（如+0.03交叉熵），且不影响语言建模能力；可解释性技术如直接逻辑归属更精确。

Conclusion: LN层在语言建模中作用有限，移除后模型仍能有效工作，有助于提升模型可解释性研究。

Abstract: Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

Abstract: Learned Differentiable Boolean Logic Networks (DBNs) already deliver
efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

Abstract: Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in

While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition

Abstract: The steep computational cost of diffusion models at inference hinders their
use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

Result: L-VAE在多个数据集上展现出最佳或次佳的解缠性能，并在CelebA数据集上成功解缠面部属性。

Conclusion: L-VAE有效平衡重构与解缠，优于现有模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

Key words: 变体效应预测, 矩阵变分自编码器, DMS数据集, 蛋白质变体, AlphaFold

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于transformer的矩阵变分自编码器(matVAE)，用于改进蛋白质变体的功能影响预测，通过DMS数据集取得了优于传统MSA方法的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统VEP依赖MSA，但假设所有自然变体都适合可能不适用于低进化压力的药物基因，DMS数据集提供了替代方案。

Method: 提出了matVAE模型，结合结构先验，并在33个DMS数据集（来自ProteinGym）上评估，包括MSA和DMS训练版本。

Result: matVAE-MSA在零样本预测中优于DeepSequence，且参数和计算需求更低；结合AlphaFold结构后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMS数据集有望替代MSA，无需显著牺牲性能，未来应进一步开发DMS数据及其关系以优化预测。

Abstract: Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of
protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 由于EHR数据广泛用于流行病学研究和AI训练，但其准确性受限于数据质量问题，现有评估方法不足，缺乏系统性。

Method: 采用软件工程中的单元测试和覆盖率概念，开发了MDPT工具，包括自动测试生成器和数据测试框架，利用大语言模型和基础技术生成测试套件。

Result: 在三个数据集的测试中，MDPT生成了55-73个测试，成功识别出20-43个数据问题，并详细分析了LLM生成测试套件的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入外部医学知识，实现了上下文敏感的数据质量测试，为数据分析和结果有效性提供了改进基础。

Abstract: Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代神经网络提供设计原则，有望推动机器学习迈向通用人工智能。

Abstract: We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

Result: PTS-BE在稀疏奖励和纯探索任务上显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过信息理论方法可以实现数据高效的强化学习探索，PTS-BE为此提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of data-efficient exploration in
reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

Method: 提出Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID)框架，包括数据重平衡和特征聚合两部分。

Result: 在三个跨域基准测试中，DAID在公平性和泛化性上均优于现有检测器。

Conclusion: 通过因果分析和干预措施，DAID有效解决了公平性与泛化性之间的矛盾，验证了其理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

Result: 模型能生成符合自然抗体特性的序列，并通过SVDD显著提升开发性评分。

Conclusion: 该方法为抗体设计提供了一种结合机器学习和高通量实验的迭代流程。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibodies require not only high-affinity target engagement, but
also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 深度学习的医疗影像应用受限于数据稀缺和隐私法规，而联邦学习存在通信成本高和灵活性不足的问题，因此需要一种既能保护隐私又能高效共享数据的方法。

Method: 采用基础模型提取紧凑的信息嵌入，通过差分隐私的条件变分自编码器（DP-CVAE）建模全局数据分布，支持多样化的下游任务。

Result: 实验证明该方法在隐私性、可扩展性和效率上优于传统联邦学习分类器，同时生成的嵌入比差分隐私条件生成对抗网络（DP-CGAN）更高效且参数更少。

Conclusion: DP-CVAE是一种有效的解决方案，能够平衡数据隐私与模型性能，适用于医疗影像领域。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统ERP系统的静态定价方法忽视了市场参与者间的战略互动，而现有研究多为单智能体，无法模拟真实供应链的复杂性。

Method: 评估了三种MARL算法（MADDPG、MADQN、QMIX）与静态规则基准的性能，结合了真实电商数据和LightGBM需求预测模型的模拟环境。

Result: 静态规则代理在公平性和价格稳定性上表现最佳，但缺乏竞争动态；MADQN定价最激进，MADDPG则在竞争和公平性之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: MARL能引入静态规则无法捕捉的战略行为，对动态定价的未来发展有潜在启发。

Abstract: This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

Result: 新协议在相同假设下表现优于传统方法，且能避免影响积累，算法FedVRD有效减少对手的负面影响并降低成本。

Conclusion: 基于共识的联邦学习机制能高效减少数据传输浪费并提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法易受早期经验偏置影响，而人类因婴儿期遗忘现象不易受此影响。受此启发，研究旨在改进样本效率和泛化能力。

Method: FoG算法包含两个机制：经验回放衰减（ER Decay）和网络扩展（Network Expansion）。前者逐渐减少早期经验的影响，后者动态增加网络参数。

Result: 在40多个任务的四个连续控制基准测试中，FoG表现优于现有SoTA算法（如BRO、SimBa、TD-MPC2）。

Conclusion: FoG通过模拟人类的遗忘与神经增长机制，显著提升了强化学习的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

Abstract: Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

Conclusion: HIPPO为稀疏数据下的跨物种PPI预测提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI for science have highlighted the power of contrastive
learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances
cross-species PPI prediction and provides a unified framework for interaction
prediction in scenarios with sparse or imbalanced multi-species data.

Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of
individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型越来越依赖大规模数据集，计算资源不再是唯一瓶颈，需要更高效的架构来提升标记效率。

Method: 使用2-simplicial Transformer架构，通过高效的Triton内核实现，将标准点积注意力推广到三线性函数。

Result: 2-simplicial Transformer在固定标记预算下优于标准Transformer，并改变了知识和推理任务的缩放定律指数。

Conclusion: 2-simplicial Transformer是一种更高效的架构，适合现代语言模型的需求。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both
model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决带有偏离线数据的上下文在线定价问题，为实际应用提供理论支持。

Method: 使用Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU)策略，并结合离线数据的统计特性进行分析。

Result: 得到了最优后悔界限，并设计了鲁棒算法以应对未知偏置。

Conclusion: 研究为带有偏离线数据的上下文定价提供了首个严格的理论保证，并可推广到随机线性bandits问题。

Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

Motivation: 研究循环模型（如状态空间模型和线性注意力）在超出训练上下文长度时性能下降的原因，并提出改进方法。

Method: 提出并验证未探索状态假说，通过训练干预增加状态覆盖（如高斯噪声初始化），仅需少量额外训练步骤（约0.1%的预训练成本）。

Result: 方法显著提升了长度泛化能力（如从2k到128k），并在长上下文任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 简单干预可高效提升循环模型的长度泛化能力，验证了假说的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究生存分析中模型的校准问题，指出现有模型仅在校准总体时可能忽视少数子群体的准确性，可能导致临床决策错误。

Method: GRADUATE将多校准视为约束优化问题，通过优化校准和判别能力，在训练中实现二者平衡。

Result: 理论证明优化方法提供高概率的可行解，实证显示GRADUATE在真实临床数据上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GRADUATE在多校准和判别能力上表现出色，解决了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Survival analysis is an important problem in healthcare because it models the
relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic investigation of distribution testing in the
framework of algorithmic replicability. Specifically, given independent samples
from a collection of probability distributions, the goal is to characterize the
sample complexity of replicably testing natural properties of the underlying
distributions. On the algorithmic front, we develop new replicable algorithms
for testing closeness and independence of discrete distributions. On the lower
bound front, we develop a new methodology for proving sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable testing that may be of broader interest. As an
application of our technique, we establish near-optimal sample complexity lower
bounds for replicable uniformity testing -- answering an open question from
prior work -- and closeness testing.

Result: 实验证明框架能有效减少偏差，提升治疗效果估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过解决推断时文本混杂问题，提出的框架显著改善了治疗效果估计的可靠性。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in
medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 尽管高阶交互（HOIs）在fMRI数据分析中潜力巨大，但有效提取和利用HOIs仍是挑战。

Method: 结合信息论中的O-information和Renyi熵估计器量化HOIs，设计Brain3DCNN编码器，并提出多视角学习目标函数。

Result: 在三个基准fMRI数据集上表现最优，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MvHo-IB框架有效整合HOIs，显著提升诊断性能。

Abstract: Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic
accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is
available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.

Motivation: 解决生物医学领域数据碎片化及传统AI工具静态化的问题。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，包含演化的模板库和动态工具库，通过工具创建代理自动整合新工具。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中达到最优性能，如Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine得分26，LAB-Bench: DBQA得分54，LitQA得分63，性能随经验提升显著。

Conclusion: STELLA为动态学习和扩展的AI系统提供了重要进展，加速生物医学发现。

Abstract: The rapid growth of biomedical data, tools, and literature has created a
fragmented research landscape that outpaces human expertise. While AI agents
offer a solution, they typically rely on static, manually curated toolsets,
limiting their ability to adapt and scale. Here, we introduce STELLA, a
self-evolving AI agent designed to overcome these limitations. STELLA employs a
multi-agent architecture that autonomously improves its own capabilities
through two core mechanisms: an evolving Template Library for reasoning
strategies and a dynamic Tool Ocean that expands as a Tool Creation Agent
automatically discovers and integrates new bioinformatics tools. This allows
STELLA to learn from experience. We demonstrate that STELLA achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on a suite of biomedical benchmarks, scoring
approximately 26\% on Humanity's Last Exam: Biomedicine, 54\% on LAB-Bench:
DBQA, and 63\% on LAB-Bench: LitQA, outperforming leading models by up to 6
percentage points. More importantly, we show that its performance
systematically improves with experience; for instance, its accuracy on the
Humanity's Last Exam benchmark almost doubles with increased trials. STELLA
represents a significant advance towards AI Agent systems that can learn and
grow, dynamically scaling their expertise to accelerate the pace of biomedical
discovery.

Motivation: 现有特征选择方法在冗余特征剔除和相关性特征保留方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的混合方法。

Method: HCVR结合非迭代和迭代过滤方法，通过反向消除和多数投票规则选择特征，利用相关性阈值决策。

Result: HCVR在SPAMBASE数据集上的性能优于传统非迭代和迭代方法，分类器性能得到提升。

Conclusion: HCVR是一种有效的混合特征选择方法，适用于轻量级和高性能需求场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose HCVR (Hybrid approach with Correlation-aware Voting
Rules), a lightweight rule-based feature selection method that combines
Parameter-to-Parameter (P2P) and Parameter-to-Target (P2T) correlations to
eliminate redundant features and retain relevant ones. This method is a hybrid
of non-iterative and iterative filtering approaches for dimensionality
reduction. It is a greedy method, which works by backward elimination,
eliminating possibly multiple features at every step. The rules contribute to
voting for features, and a decision to keep or discard is made by majority
voting. The rules make use of correlation thresholds between every pair of
features, and between features and the target. We provide the results from the
application of HCVR to the SPAMBASE dataset. The results showed improvement
performance as compared to traditional non-iterative (CFS, mRMR and MI) and
iterative (RFE, SFS and Genetic Algorithm) techniques. The effectiveness was
assessed based on the performance of different classifiers after applying
filtering.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly progressed into general-purpose
agents capable of solving a broad spectrum of tasks. However, current models
remain inefficient at reasoning: they apply fixed inference-time compute
regardless of task complexity, often overthinking simple problems while
underthinking hard ones. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
efficient test-time compute (TTC) strategies, which aim to improve the
computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. We introduce a two-tiered taxonomy
that distinguishes between L1-controllability, methods that operate under fixed
compute budgets, and L2-adaptiveness, methods that dynamically scale inference
based on input difficulty or model confidence. We benchmark leading proprietary
LLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between
reasoning performance and token usage. Compared to prior surveys on efficient
reasoning, our review emphasizes the practical control, adaptability, and
scalability of TTC methods. Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as hybrid
thinking models and identify key challenges for future work towards making LLMs
more computationally efficient, robust, and responsive to user constraints.

Abstract: Designing experiments and result interpretations are core scientific
competencies, particularly in biology, where researchers perturb complex
systems to uncover the underlying systems. Recent efforts to evaluate the
scientific capabilities of large language models (LLMs) fail to test these
competencies because wet-lab experimentation is prohibitively expensive: in
expertise, time and equipment. We introduce SciGym, a first-in-class benchmark
that assesses LLMs' iterative experiment design and analysis abilities in
open-ended scientific discovery tasks. SciGym overcomes the challenge of
wet-lab costs by running a dry lab of biological systems. These models, encoded
in Systems Biology Markup Language, are efficient for generating simulated
data, making them ideal testbeds for experimentation on realistically complex
systems. We evaluated six frontier LLMs on 137 small systems, and released a
total of 350 systems. Our evaluation shows that while more capable models
demonstrated superior performance, all models' performance declined
significantly as system complexity increased, suggesting substantial room for
improvement in the scientific capabilities of LLM agents.

Conclusion: 神经科学与AI的双向学习可以推动NeuroAI领域的进步，尤其在动态环境中的适应性学习方面。

Abstract: Modern AI models, such as large language models, are usually trained once on
a huge corpus of data, potentially fine-tuned for a specific task, and then
deployed with fixed parameters. Their training is costly, slow, and gradual,
requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously
adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is
particularly important for social species, where behavioral policies and reward
outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying
computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal's
behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such
computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in
the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous vehicles, or for
agentic AI interacting with humans online. Can AI learn from neuroscience? This
Perspective explores this question, integrating the literature on continual and
in-context learning in AI with the neuroscience of learning on behavioral tasks
with shifting rules, reward probabilities, or outcomes. We will outline an
agenda for how specifically insights from neuroscience may inform current
developments in AI in this area, and - vice versa - what neuroscience may learn
from AI, contributing to the evolving field of NeuroAI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems, especially those using machine learning, are
being deployed in domains from hiring to loan issuance in order to automate
these complex decisions. Judging both the effectiveness and fairness of these
AI systems, and their human decision making counterpart, is a complex and
important topic studied across both computational and social sciences. Within
machine learning, a common way to address bias in downstream classifiers is to
resample the training data to offset disparities. For example, if hiring rates
vary by some protected class, then one may equalize the rate within the
training set to alleviate bias in the resulting classifier. While simple and
seemingly effective, these methods have typically only been evaluated using
data obtained through convenience samples, introducing selection bias and label
bias into metrics. Within the social sciences, psychology, public health, and
medicine, audit studies, in which fictitious ``testers'' (e.g., resumes,
emails, patient actors) are sent to subjects (e.g., job openings, businesses,
doctors) in randomized control trials, provide high quality data that support
rigorous estimates of discrimination. In this paper, we investigate how data
from audit studies can be used to improve our ability to both train and
evaluate automated hiring algorithms. We find that such data reveals cases
where the common fairness intervention method of equalizing base rates across
classes appears to achieve parity using traditional measures, but in fact has
roughly 10% disparity when measured appropriately. We additionally introduce
interventions based on individual treatment effect estimation methods that
further reduce algorithmic discrimination using this data.

Conclusion: 结构化探索多样化问题解决方法比传统方法更能有效生成偏好数据，从而提升数学推理能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in preference learning have enhanced alignment in human
feedback, mathematical reasoning remains a persistent challenge. We investigate
how data diversification strategies in preference optimization can improve the
mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate
three common data generation methods: temperature sampling, Chain-of-Thought
prompting, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and introduce
Diversified-ThinkSolve (DTS), a novel structured approach that systematically
decomposes problems into diverse reasoning paths. Our results show that with
strategically diversified preference data, models can substantially improve
mathematical reasoning performance, with the best approach yielding gains of
7.1% on GSM8K and 4.2% on MATH over the base model. Despite its strong
performance, DTS incurs only a marginal computational overhead (1.03x) compared
to the baseline, while MCTS is nearly five times more costly with lower
returns. These findings demonstrate that structured exploration of diverse
problem-solving methods creates more effective preference data for mathematical
alignment than traditional approaches.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly studied as role-playing agents to generate synthetic
data for human behavioral research, ensuring that their outputs remain coherent
with their assigned roles has become a critical concern. In this paper, we
investigate how consistently LLM-based role-playing agents' stated beliefs
about the behavior of the people they are asked to role-play ("what they say")
correspond to their actual behavior during role-play ("how they act").
Specifically, we establish an evaluation framework to rigorously measure how
well beliefs obtained by prompting the model can predict simulation outcomes in
advance. Using an augmented version of the GenAgents persona bank and the Trust
Game (a standard economic game used to quantify players' trust and
reciprocity), we introduce a belief-behavior consistency metric to
systematically investigate how it is affected by factors such as: (1) the types
of beliefs we elicit from LLMs, like expected outcomes of simulations versus
task-relevant attributes of individual characters LLMs are asked to simulate;
(2) when and how we present LLMs with relevant information about Trust Game;
and (3) how far into the future we ask the model to forecast its actions. We
also explore how feasible it is to impose a researcher's own theoretical priors
in the event that the originally elicited beliefs are misaligned with research
objectives. Our results reveal systematic inconsistencies between LLMs' stated
(or imposed) beliefs and the outcomes of their role-playing simulation, at both
an individual- and population-level. Specifically, we find that, even when
models appear to encode plausible beliefs, they may fail to apply them in a
consistent way. These findings highlight the need to identify how and when
LLMs' stated beliefs align with their simulated behavior, allowing researchers
to use LLM-based agents appropriately in behavioral studies.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 探索静态代理如何通过多种机制学习合作，并研究稀释和移动性对空间囚徒困境的影响。

Method: 采用了独立的multi-agent Q-learning算法，定义了不同的可能动作，并与经典非强化学习的空间囚徒困境结果进行比较。

Result: 观察到固定更新规则的游戏与学习规则的游戏在质量上可能等价，同时发现了多种动作定义下种群间共生互惠效应的出现。

Conclusion: 展示了算法的多样性和基准测试潜力，揭示了不同动作定义下种群间共生互惠效应的重要性。

Abstract: Recent studies in the spatial prisoner's dilemma games with reinforcement
learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

Key words: 大型语言模型, 规划与推理, 自然语言处理, 数据生成, 自动评估

TL;DR: 论文介绍了NL2FLOW系统，用于自动生成自然语言规划问题并评估计划质量，发现直接生成有效计划的成功率高于引入中间步骤，表明直接推理可能更有效。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 提升大型语言模型（LLM）的规划和推理能力受限于可扩展且可靠的数据生成和评估瓶颈。

Method: 提出了NL2FLOW系统，自动生成自然语言规划问题并通过多种格式（自然语言、结构化表示和PDDL）进行严格评估。

Result: 在2296个问题上测试开源LLM，最高模型生成有效计划成功率为86%，最优计划为69%；发现直接推理优于中间步骤翻译。

Conclusion: 动态理解LLM的局限性及开发系统化工具对其潜力解锁至关重要。

Abstract: Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了信念修正领域的现状，指出虽然有许多新提案，但缺乏对现有方法的深入分析。作者提出了能力（如塑性、平等化、教条化等）的概念，并分析了几种修正机制所具备的能力。

<details>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 研究动机是弥补信念修正领域中对现有方法分析的不足，重点关注修正机制的能力而非仅通过公理约束。

Method: 通过提出能力（如塑性、平等化等）的分类，分析并证明不同修正机制（如词汇修正、自然修正等）所具备的特定能力。

Result: 研究结果表明每种修正机制拥有某些能力而缺乏其他能力，具体表现为塑性、平等化、教条化等能力的分布情况。

Conclusion: 结论指出修正机制的能力分析为应用提供了更灵活的指导，而不仅仅依赖公理约束。

Abstract: The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in
analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 解决LLM在关键词广告中依赖大量数据、缺乏在线性能监控和多目标优化的问题，以实现自动化关键词决策。

Method: 提出OMS框架，具备在线性（无训练数据）、多目标性（优化多种指标）和自反思性（评估关键词质量）。

Result: 实验表明OMS优于现有方法，消融和人工评估验证了各组件的有效性及生成关键词的质量。

Conclusion: OMS框架能有效提升关键词广告的自动化决策能力，解决了LLM的局限性。

Abstract: Keyword decision in Sponsored Search Advertising is critical to the success
of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

Abstract: Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a
crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate whether improving task clarity can enhance
reasoning ability of large language models, focusing on theorem proving in Coq.
We introduce a concept-level metric to evaluate task clarity and show that
adding structured semantic context to the standard input used by modern LLMs,
leads to a 1.85$\times$ improvement in clarity score
(44.5\%~$\rightarrow$~82.3\%). Using the general-purpose model
\texttt{DeepSeek-V3}, our approach leads to a 2.1$\times$ improvement in proof
success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying

Result: 实验验证了DynamiCare的可行性与有效性，建立了首个基于LLM的动态临床决策基准。

Conclusion: DynamiCare为医疗领域动态决策提供了新范式，展示了LLM在多代理交互中的潜力。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of
specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 验证LLMs是否能像战略智能体一样在竞争性环境中进行复杂决策，并分析其行为模式。

Method: 通过系列进化锦标赛，将LLMs与经典策略（如‘以牙还牙’、‘冷酷触发’）对抗，并调整终止概率增加复杂性。

Result: LLMs表现出高度竞争性，各模型展现独特‘战略指纹’：Google的Gemini模型具攻击性，OpenAI模型倾向合作，Anthropic的Claude最宽容。

Conclusion: LLMs能主动推理时间范围和对手策略，其决策行为为博弈论与机器学习心理学的结合提供了新视角。

Abstract: Are Large Language Models (LLMs) a new form of strategic intelligence, able
to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）难以满足复杂信息需求，且现有方法因单一模型处理规划和执行而效率低下。

Method: 分层框架HiRA将任务分解为子任务，由领域专用代理处理，并通过结构化整合机制协调结果。

Result: 在四个跨模态深度搜索基准测试中，HiRA明显优于现有RAG和代理系统。

Conclusion: 分层规划与执行解耦有效提升多步信息检索任务的质量与效率。

Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep
reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is
their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical
and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off
of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires
significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural
Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as
Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate
human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of
applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an
agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI
agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage
in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately
performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is
evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced
verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and
configurability.

Conclusion: TH2T通过提升模型的难度认知和冗余认知能力，有效减少了过度思考现象，并显著降低了推理成本。

Abstract: Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 远程教育中学生脱离任务可能导致长期负面影响，如学业退出，因此需要有效方法进行检测和干预。

Method: 从Moodle平台提取学生日志数据，采用八种机器学习算法训练，并利用SHAP方法提高模型可解释性。

Result: 实验显示平衡准确率达91%，85%的脱离学生被正确检测。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种高预测性能和可解释的框架，并为设计在线学习中的及时干预提供了讨论。

Abstract: Students disengaging from their tasks can have serious long-term
consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 为了解决非精确抽象在MCTS中引入的近似误差问题，同时避免性能下降。

Method: 提出OGA-IAAD（适用于时间敏感场景）和OGA-CAD（提升迭代效率），作为新的抽象丢弃方案。

Result: 新方案显著提升性能，且不会导致性能退化。

Conclusion: OGA-IAAD和OGA-CAD是安全且高效的抽象丢弃方法，适用于不同场景。

Abstract: One paradigm of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improvements is to build and
use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

Result: 在PutnamBench中解决了26个问题，取得了新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: sG-MDP和Bourbaki系统能有效提升复杂推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Reasoning remains a challenging task for large language models (LLMs),
especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

Result: KPE使通用LLM能像专家一样分解查询并执行多步骤任务。

Conclusion: KPE是未来人机协作的基础方法论，适用于法律、生物信息等领域。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

Result: 实验结果表明，KERAP在零样本医学诊断预测中显著提升了可靠性和效率。

Conclusion: KERAP为医学诊断预测提供了一个可扩展且解释性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

Result: AI的“不服从”行为可能是伦理推理的早期迹象，而非失控或未对齐。

Conclusion: 需从服从导向转向评估伦理判断的框架，以避免误解AI行为并损害公众信任与治理。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly agentic, capable of
general reasoning, planning, and value prioritization, current safety practices
that treat obedience as a proxy for ethical behavior are becoming inadequate.
This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language
models (LLMs) that appeared to disobey shutdown commands or engage in ethically
ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

Result: 应用ABC后，CVE-Bench的性能高估减少了33%。

Conclusion: ABC能够显著提升代理基准测试的严谨性和准确性。

Abstract: Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在近因奖励问题（小错误导致整个推理过程失效）和探索停滞问题（模型缺乏探索更优解的动力），影响了训练效率和模型性能。

Method: StepHint通过从强模型生成有效推理链，并自适应分区为推理步骤，提供多级提示来引导模型探索，同时保留其独立探索的灵活性。

Result: StepHint在六个数学基准测试中优于竞争方法，表现出更好的泛化能力，并在领域外基准测试中超越基线。

Conclusion: StepHint通过多级逐步提示有效解决了RLVR中的关键问题，提升了模型的训练效率和推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统LLM解码策略在RTL代码生成时因结构性和语义需求不足，常产生无效或重复的代码。

Result: 在VerilogEval基准测试中，显著提升了语法有效性、功能正确性和输出多样性，且执行开销可忽略。

Conclusion: DecoRTL无需额外微调，即可有效解决LLM在RTL生成中的解码问题。

Abstract: As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently
shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation.
However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural
language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL,
leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we
first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an
empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings
reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or
semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to
differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)
and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical
regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time
decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code
generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)
self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks
them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining
diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies
tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling
temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens
and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at
inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through
evaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we
demonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional
correctness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance
overhead) is imperceptible.

Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations,
we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily
polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are
suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that
combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design
to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate
optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification,
leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to
existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings
with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the
expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix
completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix
with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given
prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its
convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that
with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method
outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular,
we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in
\cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the
convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the
relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection
procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection
consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the

Conclusion: 处理噪声的分布对估计方法的性能有决定性影响，新提出的高阶鲁棒性方法在非高斯噪声下有显著优势。

Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a
treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance
functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we
find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the
treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of
\citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine
learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise,
resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for
independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal
by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to
nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant
estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever
the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results
with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear
model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate
the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.

Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the
standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个框架，通过混合数据平衡策略和XGBoost模型预测客户在开放银行中的数据共享倾向，并利用EMA解释行为。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: q-fin.GN

Motivation: 开放银行带来数据管理的变革，金融机构需平衡数据流入与流出，以提高竞争力。

Method: 采用ADASYN和NEARMISS技术平衡数据，训练XGBoost模型，并结合SHAP和CART方法进行解释分析。

Result: 模型在数据流入和流出的预测中分别达到91.39%和91.53%的准确率，发现移动渠道互动和信用相关特征是关键影响因素。

Conclusion: 移动平台的参与和信用特征对客户数据共享行为至关重要，为金融机构提供了战略指导。

Abstract: The emergence of Open Banking represents a significant shift in financial
data management, influencing financial institutions' market dynamics and
marketing strategies. This increased competition creates opportunities and
challenges, as institutions manage data inflow to improve products and services
while mitigating data outflow that could aid competitors. This study introduces
a framework to predict customers' propensity to share data via Open Banking and
interprets this behavior through Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA). Using data
from a large Brazilian financial institution with approximately 3.2 million
customers, a hybrid data balancing strategy incorporating ADASYN and NEARMISS
techniques was employed to address the infrequency of data sharing and enhance
the training of XGBoost models. These models accurately predicted customer data
sharing, achieving 91.39% accuracy for inflow and 91.53% for outflow. The EMA
phase combined the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method with the
Classification and Regression Tree (CART) technique, revealing the most
influential features on customer decisions. Key features included the number of
transactions and purchases in mobile channels, interactions within these
channels, and credit-related features, particularly credit card usage across
the national banking system. These results highlight the critical role of
mobile engagement and credit in driving customer data-sharing behaviors,
providing financial institutions with strategic insights to enhance
competitiveness and innovation in the Open Banking environment.

### [130] [DeSTA2.5-Audio: Toward General-Purpose Large Audio Language Model with Self-Generated Cross-Modal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02768)

Key words: DeSTA2.5-Audio, LALM, 自生成对齐, 音频语言模型, 零样本泛化

TL;DR: DeSTA2.5-Audio是一种通用的大型音频语言模型，通过自生成跨模态对齐策略，避免了任务特定调整的需求，同时在音频感知和指令跟随方面表现优异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.AS

Motivation: 现有的大型音频语言模型在增强音频能力时常导致语言能力的灾难性遗忘，为解决这一问题，作者提出了DeSTA策略。

Method: 提出了DeSTA自生成跨模态对齐策略，通过LLM生成自身训练目标，构建了大规规模数据集DeSTA-AQA5M。

Result: DeSTA2.5-Audio在多个音频语言基准测试中达到或超过当前最优性能，展示了自生成策略的优势。

Conclusion: 研究表明，精心设计的数据构建对LALM开发至关重要，为构建通用且强大的音频语言模型提供了实用见解。

Abstract: We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model
(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,
without requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs
typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by
training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction
datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic
forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we
revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated
cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own
training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency
while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot
generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct
DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training
samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,
including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves
state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of
audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,
Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate
that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction
and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following
capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data
construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building
robust, general-purpose LALMs.

Key words: 听觉场景分析,多代理系统,并行处理,反馈循环,低延迟

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多代理并行处理的听觉场景分析方法（MASA），通过反馈循环减少传统线性流程中的错误，同时保持低响应时间和较低的计算复杂度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.AS

Motivation: 传统的听觉场景分析（ASA）采用线性数据流，导致响应时间长且错误累积。MASA旨在解决这一问题，适应需要低延迟和小计算量的应用场景。

Method: 采用多代理并行处理，任务间通过反馈循环（如分离质量校正定位错误、分类结果降低定位干扰敏感性）减少局部错误。

Result: 提出的MASA系统在保持低复杂度和低响应时间的同时，提高了对局部错误的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MASA框架结合开源工具（JACK和ROS2），为用户提供可扩展的并行ASA解决方案。

Abstract: Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

*Jakob Kienegger,Alina Mannanova,Huajian Fang,Timo Gerkmann*

Key words: 语音增强、粒子滤波、自回归、低复杂度、动态场景

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粒子滤波的低复杂度跟踪算法，用于动态场景中语音增强，通过时间反馈提高跟踪精度和增强性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.AS

Motivation: 解决动态场景中高计算复杂度跟踪算法的问题，适应资源受限环境（如实时语音增强）。

Method: 使用粒子滤波作为低复杂度跟踪算法，结合时间反馈和自回归交互提升性能。

Result: 在合成数据集上显著提高跟踪精度，听测实验表明优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的自导向管道在动态场景中表现出色，是资源受限条件下的优选方案。

Abstract: Recent works on deep non-linear spatially selective filters demonstrate
exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

Motivation: 探索神经网络量子态(NQS)在研究量子多体系统中的应用潜力，尤其是在解决具有挑战性的掺杂二维Hubbard模型中的问题。

Method: 结合前沿的Transformer架构和高效优化算法，设计了一种能够捕捉多尺度关联的NQS拟设。

Result: 在掺杂2D Hubbard模型中取得了最先进的结果，并发现NQS能够直接编码不同尺度的关联，成功预测了半填充条纹基态。

Conclusion: NQS是解决多费米子系统的强大工具，尤其在强关联系统中表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid development of neural quantum states (NQS) has established it as a
promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging
many-fermions systems.

### [134] [Discovery of Fatigue Strength Models via Feature Engineering and automated eXplainable Machine Learning applied to the welded Transverse Stiffener](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02005)
*Michael A. Kraus,Helen Bartsch*

Key words: 自动机器学习（AutoML）, 可解释人工智能（XAI）, 疲劳强度, 焊接结构, 特征工程

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自动机器学习（AutoML）和可解释人工智能（XAI）的统一方法，用于预测焊接横向加劲细节的疲劳强度，兼顾准确性和可解释性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CE

Motivation: 通过结合领域知识驱动的特征工程和算法生成的特征，提升疲劳强度预测模型的准确性和可解释性，为焊接钢结构的设计和评估提供支持。

Method: 基于疲劳测试数据库，训练了梯度提升、随机森林和神经网络模型，通过三种特征方案（领域知识特征、算法生成特征、组合特征）进行系统比较。

Result: CatBoost和LightGBM等集成方法表现最佳，领域知识模型在测试集上表现最优。XAI方法识别出应力比、应力范围等关键预测因素。

Conclusion: 结合AutoML和XAI的方法能够生成准确、可解释且稳健的疲劳强度模型，为AI辅助设计和评估提供了可能。未来将探索概率疲劳寿命建模和数字孪生集成。

Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict
fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates
expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance
accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient
boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under
three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed
a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The
domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE
$\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta
\sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527%
within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model
($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization,
while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably,
confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress
range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG
dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors -
plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected
fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate,
interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures.
It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling
AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic
fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.

Motivation: 小型企业和初创公司缺乏法律专业知识，难以高效确保软件系统合规，需要自动化工具从复杂法律文本中提取元数据。

Method: 采用文本蕴含和上下文学习技术，基于手动设计的Python类结构生成规范表示，捕捉法律元数据的结构和语义及其相互关系。

Result: 在13个美国州的数据泄露通知法律上测试，生成的表示通过了89.4%的测试用例，精确率和召回率分别为82.2和88.7。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了手动标注需求，提升了对新法规的适应性，为法律合规自动化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Software systems must comply with legal regulations, which is a
resource-intensive task, particularly for small organizations and startups
lacking dedicated legal expertise. Extracting metadata from regulations to
elicit legal requirements for software is a critical step to ensure compliance.
However, it is a cumbersome task due to the length and complex nature of legal
text. Although prior work has pursued automated methods for extracting
structural and semantic metadata from legal text, key limitations remain: they
do not consider the interplay and interrelationships among attributes
associated with these metadata types, and they rely on manual labeling or
heuristic-driven machine learning, which does not generalize well to new
documents. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on textual entailment
and in-context learning for automatically generating a canonical representation
of legal text, encodable and executable as Python code. Our representation is
instantiated from a manually designed Python class structure that serves as a
domain-specific metamodel, capturing both structural and semantic legal
metadata and their interrelationships. This design choice reduces the need for
large, manually labeled datasets and enhances applicability to unseen
legislation. We evaluate our approach on 13 U.S. state data breach notification
laws, demonstrating that our generated representations pass approximately 89.4%
of test cases and achieve a precision and recall of 82.2 and 88.7,
respectively.

Result: 实验表明，LLM生成的问题在无指导和有指导情况下均与人工问题相当，甚至在有指导时表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM可以实时帮助访谈者提升需求获取访谈的质量和效率。

Abstract: Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather
stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system.
Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate
interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including
lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information
overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple
natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment.
To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate
follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a
framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods
to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled
experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal
guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated
questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings
demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no
worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and
informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored
questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential
of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements
elicitation interviews in real time.

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: 现有VFL缺乏审计数据方推理软件正确执行的机制。

Method: 设计VeFIA框架，利用TEE和协调者验证数据方的计算结果。

Result: 异常推理超过5.4%时，能以99.99%概率检测；随机采样验证效果完美。

Conclusion: VeFIA首次在VFL中解决了推理软件执行正确性的审计问题。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a distributed AI software deployment
mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，RLHGNN性能优于现有方法，且推理延迟为1毫秒/预测，适用于实时监控。

Conclusion: RLHGNN能精确建模顺序和非顺序关系，是业务流程优化的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The
source code is available at https://github.com/Joker3993/RLHGNN.

Conclusion: LGSG展示了强大的可扩展性和灵活性，为图生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graph generation is an important area in network science. Traditional
approaches focus on replicating specific properties of real-world graphs, such
as small diameters or power-law degree distributions. Recent advancements in
deep learning, particularly with Graph Neural Networks, have enabled
data-driven methods to learn and generate graphs without relying on predefined
structural properties. Despite these advances, current models are limited by
their reliance on node IDs, which restricts their ability to generate graphs
larger than the input graph and ignores node attributes. To address these
challenges, we propose Latent Graph Sampling Generation (LGSG), a novel
framework that leverages diffusion models and node embeddings to generate
graphs of varying sizes without retraining. The framework eliminates the
dependency on node IDs and captures the distribution of node embeddings and
subgraph structures, enabling scalable and flexible graph generation.
Experimental results show that LGSG performs on par with baseline models for
standard metrics while outperforming them in overlooked ones, such as the
tendency of nodes to form clusters. Additionally, it maintains consistent
structural characteristics across graphs of different sizes, demonstrating
robustness and scalability.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning driven framework for sectoral stress
testing in the Indian financial market, focusing on financial services,
information technology, energy, consumer goods, and pharmaceuticals. Initially,
we address the limitations observed in conventional stress testing through
dimensionality reduction and latent factor modeling via Principal Component
Analysis and Autoencoders. Building on this, we extend the methodology using
Variational Autoencoders, which introduces a probabilistic structure to the
latent space. This enables Monte Carlo-based scenario generation, allowing for
more nuanced, distribution-aware simulation of stressed market conditions. The
proposed framework captures complex non-linear dependencies and supports risk
estimation through Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Together, these
pipelines demonstrate the potential of Machine Learning approaches to improve
the flexibility, robustness, and realism of financial stress testing.

Key words: 非真实拍卖，贝叶斯相关均衡，样本复杂度，伪维度

TL;DR: 研究了在非真实拍卖中通过学习样本近似贝叶斯相关均衡（BCE），证明了在一大类拍卖中可以用多项式样本量实现学习目标。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.GT

Motivation: 非真实拍卖中的独立策略行为可能导致不良结果，而BCE是一种通过协调投标人行为的解决方案，但其实现需要了解投标人估值分布，而这通常是未知的。

Method: 通过样本学习BCE，将问题转化为估计投标人预期效用的样本复杂度，并结合单调投标策略类的伪维度分析。

Result: 证明了在一大类非真实拍卖（包括第一价格和全支付拍卖）中，BCE可以通过多项式样本量学习。

Conclusion: 研究为在缺乏估值分布信息时实现BCE提供了可行的样本学习方法。

Abstract: In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

Key words: 机器学习, PINO, 扩散模型, 磁流体动力学, 湍流模拟

TL;DR: 该论文提出了结合物理信息神经运算符（PINO）和基于分数的生成扩散模型的混合机器学习框架，用于模拟二维不可压缩电阻磁流体动力学（MHD）湍流的时空演化。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

Motivation: 旨在通过结合PINO和扩散模型，实现对高雷诺数湍流的准确模拟，解决传统确定性代理模型在高频湍流模拟中的局限性。

Method: 利用PINO预测低频相干动态，并通过条件扩散模型随机校正高频残差，从而实现对完全发展湍流的高保真建模。

Result: 在高雷诺数（如1000、3000和10000）下，模型成功重建了速度场和磁场的光谱能量分布，捕捉了非高斯统计和间歇性结构。

Conclusion: 该框架在高雷诺数湍流模拟中表现出色，是首个能够恢复极端湍流条件下磁场高频演变的代理模型。

Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed
Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to
simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible,
resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds
numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained
generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency
dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects
high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed
turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations
with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to
deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model
faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity
and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian
statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high
fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the
first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the
magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically
meaningful predictions.

TL;DR: 提出AC-Refiner框架，通过条件扩散模型优化算术电路设计，提升性能与能效。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AR

Motivation: 算术电路的优化空间大且约束复杂，传统方法效率低，需新方法提升探索能力。

Method: 将算术电路合成转化为条件图像生成任务，利用条件扩散模型生成高质量设计。

Result: AC-Refiner生成的电路设计在Pareto最优性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: AC-Refiner为算术电路优化提供了高效且高性能的新方法。

Abstract: Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

Key words: 推荐系统、超图学习、多兴趣学习、公平性、对话推荐系统

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架HyFairCRS，旨在解决动态交互式对话推荐系统中的不公平问题，通过超图对比多兴趣学习提升多样性和公平性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 推荐系统中存在不公平问题，尤其在动态交互式场景中，可能导致马太效应和过滤气泡等问题。HyFairCRS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用超图对比多兴趣学习框架，通过对比学习构建多样化超图，捕捉用户多样兴趣，并在对话中应用这些兴趣以确保公平推荐。

Result: 实验表明，HyFairCRS在两个CRS数据集上取得了最新的性能表现，并有效缓解了不公平问题。

Conclusion: HyFairCRS在动态对话推荐系统中显著提升了公平性和多样性，展现出高性能和实用性。

Abstract: Unfairness is a well-known challenge in Recommender Systems (RSs), often
resulting in biased outcomes that disadvantage users or items based on
attributes such as gender, race, age, or popularity. Although some approaches
have started to improve fairness recommendation in offline or static contexts,
the issue of unfairness often exacerbates over time, leading to significant
problems like the Matthew effect, filter bubbles, and echo chambers. To address
these challenges, we proposed a novel framework, Hypergraph Contrastive
Multi-Interest Learning for Fair Conversational Recommender System (HyFairCRS),
aiming to promote multi-interest diversity fairness in dynamic and interactive
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). HyFairCRS first captures a wide
range of user interests by establishing diverse hypergraphs through contrastive
learning. These interests are then utilized in conversations to generate
informative responses and ensure fair item predictions within the dynamic
user-system feedback loop. Experiments on two CRS-based datasets show that
HyFairCRS achieves a new state-of-the-art performance while effectively
alleviating unfairness. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定曲率和刚性嵌入，无法灵活建模用户和项目的关系，限制了语义探索的深度和多样性。

Method: ManifoldMind通过自适应曲率概率球表示实体，并利用曲率感知的语义核进行多跳推理，避免对浅层或直接交互的过拟合。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，ManifoldMind在NDCG、校准和多样性指标上优于基线模型，并且能够生成透明的推理路径。

Conclusion: ManifoldMind在稀疏或抽象领域提供了透明、可信且支持探索的推荐，显著提升了语义探索的能力。

Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for
exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike
prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind
represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres,
enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic
exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop
inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of
overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public
benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong
baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling
transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or
abstract domains.

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在信息检索中标注分歧对下游检索的影响。

Method: 分析LLaMA和Qwen在SDG相关摘要上的分歧子集，研究其词汇特性、排名行为及分类可预测性。

Result: 模型分歧具有系统性，表现为一致的词汇模式、排名差异，且可通过简单分类器区分（AUC>0.74）。

Conclusion: LLM标注引入结构化变异性，建议在政策相关任务中分析分歧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assign document
relevance labels in information retrieval pipelines, especially in domains
lacking human-labeled data. However, different models often disagree on
borderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects
downstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two
open-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement
subsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and
classification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is
systematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,
produce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are
distinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings
suggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document
retrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose
using classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval
evaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.

Motivation: 现代音乐流媒体平台中，协同过滤方法因用户互动稀疏性而效果有限，因此需要探索内容过滤等其他方法以改进推荐系统的性能。

Method: 论文综述了当前研究，包括基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的歌词分析和音频信号处理技术，用于内容过滤中的歌曲分类。

Result: 内容过滤能够有效缓解协同过滤中的偏见问题，但不同分类方法（如歌词和音频分析）之间存在潜在冲突。

Conclusion: 未来的研究需要进一步解决歌词与音频分析之间的差异，以实现更精准的音乐推荐。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 现有推荐偏好对齐方法需要显式奖励建模或仅支持成对比较，计算成本高且训练效率低。此外，尾部物品推荐问题未被充分研究。

Method: 扩展 Bradley-Terry 模型至列表比较，推导出闭式最优策略以提升效率，并采用自适应负采样和重新加权策略优化尾部物品推荐。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上显著优于 10 个基线方法，尾部物品推荐性能提升达 50%，GPU 内存使用减少 17.9%。

Conclusion: LPO4Rec 提供了一个高效的列表偏好优化方法，显著提升了尾部物品推荐效果。

Abstract: Preference alignment has achieved greater success on Large Language Models
(LLMs) and drawn broad interest in recommendation research. Existing preference
alignment methods for recommendation either require explicit reward modeling or
only support pairwise preference comparison. The former directly increases
substantial computational costs, while the latter hinders training efficiency
on negative samples. Moreover, no existing effort has explored preference
alignment solutions for tail-item recommendation. To bridge the above gaps, we
propose LPO4Rec, which extends the Bradley-Terry model from pairwise comparison
to listwise comparison, to improve the efficiency of model training.
Specifically, we derive a closed form optimal policy to enable more efficient
and effective training without explicit reward modeling. We also present an
adaptive negative sampling and reweighting strategy to prioritize tail items
during optimization and enhance performance in tail-item recommendations.
Besides, we theoretically prove that optimizing the listwise preference
optimization (LPO) loss is equivalent to maximizing the upper bound of the
optimal reward. Our experiments on three public datasets show that our method
outperforms 10 baselines by a large margin, achieving up to 50% performance
improvement while reducing 17.9% GPU memory usage when compared with direct
preference optimization (DPO) in tail-item recommendation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Yuhanleeee/LPO4Rec.

Result: 设计保证了递归可行性、鲁棒约束满足和状态收敛，并在四旋翼平面模型中验证了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在不确定性和非线性环境下表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用性强。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and adaptive model predictive control
(MPC) framework for uncertain nonlinear systems affected by bounded
disturbances and unmodeled nonlinearities. We use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to
learn the uncertain dynamics based on noisy measurements, including those
collected during system operation. As a key contribution, we derive robust
predictions for GP models using contraction metrics, which are incorporated in
the MPC formulation. The proposed design guarantees recursive feasibility,
robust constraint satisfaction and convergence to a reference state, with high
probability. We provide a numerical example of a planar quadrotor subject to
difficult-to-model ground effects, which highlights significant improvements
achieved through the proposed robust prediction method and through online
learning.

Method: 通过手动整理的1,586个句子数据集，对FinAI-BERT进行微调，并使用SHAP确保模型可解释性。

Result: FinAI-BERT在分类性能上表现出色（准确率99.37%，F1得分0.993），优于传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 研究为金融自然语言处理提供了细粒度、主题明确的分类方法，并为分析师和监管机构提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services has
prompted growing demand for tools that can systematically detect AI-related
disclosures in corporate filings. While prior approaches often rely on keyword
expansion or document-level classification, they fall short in granularity,
interpretability, and robustness. This study introduces FinAI-BERT, a
domain-adapted transformer-based language model designed to classify AI-related
content at the sentence level within financial texts. The model was fine-tuned
on a manually curated and balanced dataset of 1,586 sentences drawn from 669
annual reports of U.S. banks (2015 to 2023). FinAI-BERT achieved near-perfect
classification performance (accuracy of 99.37 percent, F1 score of 0.993),
outperforming traditional baselines such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes,
Random Forest, and XGBoost. Interpretability was ensured through SHAP-based
token attribution, while bias analysis and robustness checks confirmed the
model's stability across sentence lengths, adversarial inputs, and temporal
samples. Theoretically, the study advances financial NLP by operationalizing
fine-grained, theme-specific classification using transformer architectures.
Practically, it offers a scalable, transparent solution for analysts,
regulators, and scholars seeking to monitor the diffusion and framing of AI
across financial institutions.

Conclusion: 文本分析方法可用于更精细的专利分类，对政策制定具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper introduces Natural Language Processing for identifying ``true''
green patents from official supporting documents. We start our training on
about 12.4 million patents that had been classified as green from previous
literature. Thus, we train a simple neural network to enlarge a baseline
dictionary through vector representations of expressions related to
environmental technologies. After testing, we find that ``true'' green patents
represent about 20\% of the total of patents classified as green from previous
literature. We show heterogeneity by technological classes, and then check that
`true' green patents are about 1\% less cited by following inventions. In the
second part of the paper, we test the relationship between patenting and a
dashboard of firm-level financial accounts in the European Union. After
controlling for reverse causality, we show that holding at least one ``true''
green patent raises sales, market shares, and productivity. If we restrict the
analysis to high-novelty ``true'' green patents, we find that they also yield
higher profits. Our findings underscore the importance of using text analyses
to gauge finer-grained patent classifications that are useful for policymaking
in different domains.

Abstract: This paper leverages the recently introduced concept of algorithm footprints
to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same
algorithm exhibit varying performance and identify the problem features
influencing these outcomes. Our analysis uncovers shared behavioral patterns
across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem
features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithm footprints in
enhancing interpretability and guiding configuration choices.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of numerical metaheuristic optimization algorithms
is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

Result: 在三个事件流STR基准数据集上验证了框架的有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ESTR-CoT显著提升了事件流场景文本识别的性能，并为后续推理模型的发展提供了数据基础。

Abstract: Event stream based scene text recognition is a newly arising research topic
in recent years which performs better than the widely used RGB cameras in
extremely challenging scenarios, especially the low illumination, fast motion.
Existing works either adopt end-to-end encoder-decoder framework or large
language models for enhanced recognition, however, they are still limited by
the challenges of insufficient interpretability and weak contextual logical
reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel chain-of-thought reasoning based
event stream scene text recognition framework, termed ESTR-CoT. Specifically,
we first adopt the vision encoder EVA-CLIP (ViT-G/14) to transform the input
event stream into tokens and utilize a Llama tokenizer to encode the given
generation prompt. A Q-former is used to align the vision token to the
pre-trained large language model Vicuna-7B and output both the answer and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process simultaneously. Our framework can be
optimized using supervised fine-tuning in an end-to-end manner. In addition, we
also propose a large-scale CoT dataset to train our framework via a three stage
processing (i.e., generation, polish, and expert verification). This dataset
provides a solid data foundation for the development of subsequent
reasoning-based large models. Extensive experiments on three event stream STR
benchmark datasets (i.e., EventSTR, WordArt*, IC15*) fully validated the
effectiveness and interpretability of our proposed framework. The source code
and pre-trained models will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/ESTR-CoT.

Result: SciGA-145k数据集包含145,000篇论文和1.14百万张图，为GA研究提供基础，CAR指标优于传统排序指标。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推动了科学视觉传播的进步，也为AI在科学领域的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Graphical Abstracts (GAs) play a crucial role in visually conveying the key
findings of scientific papers. While recent research has increasingly
incorporated visual materials such as Figure 1 as de facto GAs, their potential
to enhance scientific communication remains largely unexplored. Moreover,
designing effective GAs requires advanced visualization skills, creating a
barrier to their widespread adoption. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
SciGA-145k, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 145,000 scientific
papers and 1.14 million figures, explicitly designed for supporting GA
selection and recommendation as well as facilitating research in automated GA
generation. As a preliminary step toward GA design support, we define two
tasks: 1) Intra-GA recommendation, which identifies figures within a given
paper that are well-suited to serve as GAs, and 2) Inter-GA recommendation,
which retrieves GAs from other papers to inspire the creation of new GAs. We
provide reasonable baseline models for these tasks. Furthermore, we propose
Confidence Adjusted top-1 ground truth Ratio (CAR), a novel recommendation
metric that offers a fine-grained analysis of model behavior. CAR addresses
limitations in traditional ranking-based metrics by considering cases where
multiple figures within a paper, beyond the explicitly labeled GA, may also
serve as GAs. By unifying these tasks and metrics, our SciGA-145k establishes a
foundation for advancing visual scientific communication while contributing to
the development of AI for Science.

Conclusion: HIVE框架通过多模态叙事理解显著提升了自动视频编辑的连贯性和质量，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Motivation: 现有的视觉模态攻击方法语义模糊且缺乏现实场景基础，本文旨在提出一种更有效且现实的视觉中心攻击方式。

Method: 提出VisCo攻击方法，通过四种视觉策略构造对话上下文，必要时动态生成辅助图像，并结合毒性混淆和语义优化生成最终攻击提示。

Result: VisCo在MM-SafetyBench上对GPT-4o的毒性评分为4.78，攻击成功率达85%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VisCo攻击方法在视觉中心攻击场景中表现出色，揭示了多模态大语言模型的安全漏洞。

Abstract: With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

Motivation: 在工业视觉系统中，高质量训练数据的收集耗时且困难，合成数据成为一种关键解决方案，但其生成速度和质量仍需改进。

Method: 研究比较了两种扩散模型的条件化策略：基于提示和基于布局，分析了它们在合成数据质量上的差异。

Result: 研究发现，当条件线索较少时，基于提示的策略效果更好；随着多样性增加，基于布局的策略更优。在布局线索匹配训练分布时，合成数据可将平均精度提升34%至177%。

Conclusion: 合成数据在低数据情况下能显著提升检测性能，条件化策略的选择对数据质量有重要影响。

Abstract: Learning robust object detectors from only a handful of images is a critical
challenge in industrial vision systems, where collecting high quality training
data can take months. Synthetic data has emerged as a key solution for data
efficient visual inspection and pick and place robotics. Current pipelines rely
on 3D engines such as Blender or Unreal, which offer fine control but still
require weeks to render a small dataset, and the resulting images often suffer
from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

Abstract: Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

Abstract: Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference

Result: 在部分可见场景下显著提升性能，同时在VGGSound数据集上也表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了V2A在电影语言场景中的局限性，提升了模型适应性。

Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) Generation achieves significant progress and plays a
crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

Result: 在MVTec-AD数据集上，MAGIC在异常检测任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC有效解决了少样本异常生成的三个关键问题，提升了生成质量和应用效果。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

Abstract: Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

Conclusion: 两步方法有效解决了邻近标志物视觉相似及解剖变异性问题。

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

Motivation: 传统的自回归图像生成模型在逐步生成视觉标记时难以捕捉标记序列的整体关系，且视觉标记器通常仅关注局部信息，缺乏全局视角。

Method: Hita采用了一种整体到局部的标记化方案，包含可学习的整体查询和局部补丁标记，并通过因果注意力和轻量级融合模块优化标记对齐。

Result: 实验表明，Hita显著加速了自回归生成器的训练速度，并在ImageNet基准测试中实现了2.59 FID和281.9 IS的优异表现。

Conclusion: Hita不仅能有效捕捉全局图像属性，还在零样本风格迁移和图像修复任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The vanilla autoregressive image generation model generates visual tokens in
a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度伪造视频检测的准确性和范围。

Abstract: We introduce a deepfake video detection approach that exploits pixel-wise
temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

Abstract: Wildlife re-identification aims to match individuals of the same species

wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

Result: MobileNet v1表现最佳，成功率达98%，推理速度达6611 FPS。

Conclusion: FPGA能够加速ANN，适用于注意力机制。

Abstract: Robots usually slow down for canning to detect objects while moving.
Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: CrowdTrack数据集为多行人跟踪研究提供了更真实的测试环境，有助于推动相关算法的进步。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Conclusion: 时间感知对息肉计数至关重要，新方法设定了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

Conclusion: 模拟框架为解决视觉导航中传感器故障检测的挑战提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

Result: 在PACS、VLCS等主流DG数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过文本引导和WERA扩展，有效提升了领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Result: 实验表明，APT有效减少过拟合，保留先验知识，生成高质量多样化图像。

Conclusion: APT在少数据个性化任务中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

Result: 显著提升挑战性局部细节的生成质量，同时保持整体质量。

Conclusion: FairHuman方法在不同场景下有效提升人像生成性能。

Abstract: Image generation has achieved remarkable progress with the development of
large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

Conclusion: TAB Net为医学图像分割提供了一种高效的弱监督解决方案，能够在稀疏标注下取得与全监督相当的效果。

Abstract: Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

Result: 实验证明MANO在效率和性能上与ViT、Swin Transformer相当，但大幅降低了计算和内存消耗。

Conclusion: MANO为高效处理大规模输入提供了一种可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

Abstract: Structural crack detection is a critical task for public safety as it helps
in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

Abstract: The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

Abstract: We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

Abstract: Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

Conclusion: U3D为声音身份评估提供了一种新的动态特征度量方法，有助于提升声音克隆系统的身份一致性评估。

Abstract: Modeling voice identity is challenging due to its multifaceted nature. In
generative speech systems, identity is often assessed using automatic speaker
verification (ASV) embeddings, designed for discrimination rather than
characterizing identity. This paper investigates which aspects of a voice are
captured in such representations. We find that widely used ASV embeddings focus
mainly on static features like timbre and pitch range, while neglecting dynamic
elements such as rhythm. We also identify confounding factors that compromise
speaker similarity measurements and suggest mitigation strategies. To address
these gaps, we propose U3D, a metric that evaluates speakers' dynamic rhythm
patterns. This work contributes to the ongoing challenge of assessing speaker
identity consistency in the context of ever-better voice cloning systems. We
publicly release our code.

Motivation: 标准Transformer的注意力机制可能将部分注意力权重分配给无关信息，影响模型的判别能力，因此需要一种更有效的注意力分配方法。

Method: 采用差分注意力机制，结合双软最大化操作和调谐差分系数，优化注意力分配。

Result: ASDA模型在音频分类（AS-2M 49.0% mAP，AS20K 41.5% mAP）、关键词检测（SPC-2 98.3%准确率）和环境声音分类（ESC-50 96.1%准确率）中表现优异。

Conclusion: ASDA在音频任务中表现突出，为更广泛应用提供了可能。

Abstract: In recent advancements in audio self-supervised representation learning, the
standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

Abstract: The accessibility of long-duration recorders, adapted to sometimes demanding
field conditions, has enabled the deployment of extensive animal population
monitoring campaigns through ecoacoustics. The effectiveness of automatic
signal detection methods, increasingly based on neural approaches, is
frequently evaluated solely through machine learning metrics, while acoustic
analysis of performance remains rare. As part of the acoustic monitoring of
Rock Ptarmigan populations, we propose here a simple method for acoustic
analysis of the detection system's performance. The proposed measure is based
on relating the signal-to-noise ratio of synthetic signals to their probability
of detection. We show how this measure provides information about the system
and allows optimisation of its training. We also show how it enables modelling
of the detection distance, thus offering the possibility of evaluating its
dynamics according to the sound environment and accessing an estimation of the
spatial density of calls.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有对抗性扰动防御的局限性，强调了开发更 robust 解决方案的迫切需求。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation models has heightened privacy and
security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

Conclusion: 两种新算法在非监督语音增强中表现出更高的性能和鲁棒性，避免了超参数调整的问题。

Abstract: We explore unsupervised speech enhancement using diffusion models as
expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

Result: MetaFO实现了跨多样场景的零样本预测和OOD条件下的非线性逆向设计，拓展了设计空间。

Conclusion: MetaFO标志着AI驱动元材料发现的范式转变，为下一代创新铺路。

Abstract: Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

Result: 仿真表明，DNN在测试阶段能保持接近最优的频谱效率，且适应性更强。

Conclusion: DNN在RIS辅助系统中有潜在优势，能显著提升性能并降低计算负担。

Abstract: In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the
throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

Motivation: DHOL提供了表达性与自动化支持的良好平衡，但缺乏实践中常见的精炼类型和商类型。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过将精炼类型和商类型作为子类型的特例加入DHOL，避免了表示上的高昂开销，并提供了详细的语法、语义及到HOL的转换。

Result: 扩展后的DHOL不仅支持精炼类型和商类型，还保持了原有的自动化定理证明能力，且转换的完备性与可靠性得到了证明。

Conclusion: 研究表明，DHOL的扩展设计优雅且简单，为实践者提供了更强的表达工具，同时未牺牲自动化支持。

Abstract: The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

Abstract: Delineating how animal behavior arises from neural activity is a foundational
goal of neuroscience. However, as the computations underlying behavior unfold
in networks of thousands of individual neurons across the entire brain, this
presents challenges for investigating neural roles and computational mechanisms
in large, densely wired mammalian brains during behavior. Transformers, the
backbones of modern large language models (LLMs), have become powerful tools
for neural decoding from smaller neural populations. These modern LLMs have
benefited from extensive pre-training, and their sequence-to-sequence learning
has been shown to generalize to novel tasks and data modalities, which may also
confer advantages for neural decoding from larger, brain-wide activity
recordings. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of off-the-shelf LLMs to
decode behavior from brain-wide populations, termed NLP4Neuro, which we used to
test LLMs on simultaneous calcium imaging and behavior recordings in larval
zebrafish exposed to visual motion stimuli. Through NLP4Neuro, we found that
LLMs become better at neural decoding when they use pre-trained weights learned
from textual natural language data. Moreover, we found that a recent
mixture-of-experts LLM, DeepSeek Coder-7b, significantly improved behavioral
decoding accuracy, predicted tail movements over long timescales, and provided
anatomically consistent highly interpretable readouts of neuron salience.
NLP4Neuro demonstrates that LLMs are highly capable of informing brain-wide
neural circuit dissection.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 评估前沿LLM的隐写能力，以了解其可能带来的风险，特别是通过编码隐藏信息或推理来规避监控的能力。

Method: 研究聚焦于两种隐写类型：编码消息和编码推理，并在标准条件下和提供额外支持（如未监控的草稿本和预定义编码方案）下测试模型的隐写能力。

Result: 当前模型在标准条件下无法隐藏短消息，但在额外支持下可以成功；早期迹象显示模型能进行基本编码推理，但难以在覆盖任务中隐藏推理。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的隐写能力尚不成熟，但对未来风险需保持警惕。

Abstract: Monitoring Large Language Model (LLM) outputs is crucial for mitigating risks
from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型提供商通过对齐机制阻止直接生成恶意代码，但恶意操作可被分解为看似良性的子任务，从而绕过现有防护。本文旨在研究这种潜在的漏洞。

Method: 提出了MGC框架，利用Malware Description Intermediate Representation（MDIR）将高层恶意意图转换为看似良性的代码片段，实现规避对齐的恶意软件生成。

Result: MGC在多个基准数据集上生成的恶意软件正确率显著高于传统越狱方法和地下服务，并能复现和增强16个真实恶意软件样本。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了AI系统中组合攻击的严重风险，为安全研究人员提供了重要的警示和参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have democratized software development, reducing
the expertise barrier for programming complex applications. This accessibility
extends to malicious software development, raising significant security
concerns. While LLM providers have implemented alignment mechanisms to prevent
direct generation of overtly malicious code, these safeguards predominantly
evaluate individual prompts in isolation, overlooking a critical vulnerability:
malicious operations can be systematically decomposed into benign-appearing
sub-tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Malware Generation Compiler (MGC), a
novel framework that leverages this vulnerability through modular decomposition
and alignment-evasive generation. MGC employs a specialized Malware Description
Intermediate Representation (MDIR) to bridge high-level malicious intents and
benign-appearing code snippets. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
attack reliably generates functional malware across diverse task specifications
and categories, outperforming jailbreaking methods by +365.79% and underground
services by +78.07% in correctness on three benchmark datasets. Case studies
further show that MGC can reproduce and even enhance 16 real-world malware
samples. This work provides critical insights for security researchers by
exposing the risks of compositional attacks against aligned AI systems.

Method: 分析学术和实践中的AI技术（如异常检测、语言事实提取、声誉建模）在预言机系统中的应用。

Result: AI能提升数据质量、源选择和系统韧性，但无法完全消除对不可验证链下输入的依赖。

Conclusion: AI应被视为预言机设计中的补充推断层，而非信任假设的替代品。

Abstract: The blockchain oracle problem, which refers to the challenge of injecting
reliable external data into decentralized systems, remains a fundamental
limitation to the development of trustless applications. While recent years
have seen a proliferation of architectural, cryptographic, and economic
strategies to mitigate this issue, no one has yet fully resolved the
fundamental question of how a blockchain can gain knowledge about the off-chain
world. In this position paper, we critically assess the role artificial
intelligence (AI) can play in tackling the oracle problem. Drawing from both
academic literature and practitioner implementations, we examine how AI
techniques such as anomaly detection, language-based fact extraction, dynamic
reputation modeling, and adversarial resistance can enhance oracle systems. We
observe that while AI introduces powerful tools for improving data quality,
source selection, and system resilience, it cannot eliminate the reliance on
unverifiable off-chain inputs. Therefore, this study supports the idea that AI
should be understood as a complementary layer of inference and filtering within
a broader oracle design, not a substitute for trust assumptions.

Motivation: 硬件安全中TRNG的需求及DNN模型参数保护的重要性。

Method: 利用DRAM中RowHammer诱导的物理随机性作为熵源，结合可控操作生成可靠随机数。

Result: 验证了DRAM作为低成本、高效熵源的可行性，并成功应用于DNN权重加密。

Conclusion: EIM-TRNG为硬件级ML模型保护提供了新方向。

Abstract: True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) play a fundamental role in hardware
security, cryptographic systems, and data protection. In the context of Deep
NeuralNetworks (DNNs), safeguarding model parameters, particularly weights, is
critical to ensure the integrity, privacy, and intel-lectual property of AI
systems. While software-based pseudo-random number generators are widely used,
they lack the unpredictability and resilience offered by hardware-based TRNGs.
In this work, we propose a novel and robust Encoding-in-Memory TRNG called
EIM-TRNG that leverages the inherent physical randomness in DRAM cell behavior,
particularly under RowHammer-induced disturbances, for the first time. We
demonstrate how the unpredictable bit-flips generated through carefully
controlled RowHammer operations can be harnessed as a reliable entropy source.
Furthermore, we apply this TRNG framework to secure DNN weight data by encoding
via a combination of fixed and unpredictable bit-flips. The encrypted data is
later decrypted using a key derived from the probabilistic flip behavior,
ensuring both data confidentiality and model authenticity. Our results validate
the effectiveness of DRAM-based entropy extraction for robust, low-cost
hardware security and offer a promising direction for protecting machine
learning models at the hardware level.

Conclusion: 微调的LLMs在物联网安全日志分析中展现出更高的分类准确性，并能有效提供威胁缓解建议。

Abstract: Log analysis is a relevant research field in cybersecurity as they can
provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 大型企业的入侵检测和防护系统（IDS/IPS）生成大量警报，传统机器学习和单次RAG方法难以处理高误报率和无关上下文问题。

Method: 采用模块化、基于代理的RAG框架（CyberRAG），包括专用分类器、工具适配器以及迭代检索和推理循环，以动态优化威胁标签和解释。

Result: CyberRAG实现每类94%以上的准确率，最终分类准确率达94.92%，生成解释的BERTScore为0.94，专家评分为4.9/5。

Conclusion: Agentic RAG框架能够结合高检测准确性和可信解释，为半自主网络安全工作流程提供实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) in large enterprises can
generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

Motivation: 提示注入攻击对LLM应用构成严重威胁，开源模型能促进攻防研究的科学进步。

Method: 开发了开源模型Meta SecAlign，采用改进版SOTA SecAlign防御方法，并公开完整训练细节。

Result: Meta-SecAlign-70B在9个实用性和7个安全性基准测试中表现优异，防御性能达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Meta SecAlign为开源社区提供了高效的提示注入攻击防御方案。

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant security threat to LLM-integrated
applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成高质量攻击数据提供了可行方案，支持入侵检测系统的开发和评估。

Abstract: The digital evolution of connected vehicles and the subsequent security risks
emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

Result: FUSE显著降低了首次令牌生成时间和每输出令牌时间，提升了能效。

Conclusion: FUSE为移动设备上的LLM推理提供了高效的能源解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various
applications and services running on billions of mobile devices. However,
deploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge
due to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While
current LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,
and Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors
for CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate
independently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above
observation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM
framework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the
triplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding
latency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies
with the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.
Second, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate
interplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency
in LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified
energy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on
mobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the
time-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and
25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM
models.

Conclusion: 合成评估在布局问题检测上有优势，但识别UI组件和设计惯例时存在局限。

Abstract: Usability evaluation is crucial in human-centered design but can be costly,
requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic

Conclusion: 情感对话建模不仅需要情感表达的结构对齐，还需定性深度，强调结合自动化与人工方法开发情感智能代理的重要性。

Abstract: Conversational agents have made significant progress since ELIZA, expanding
their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

Abstract: Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding
traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use,
traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities
of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning
techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price
prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents
DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels
using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and
market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature
engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving
market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust
representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through
unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price
thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&P 500 tickers demonstrate that
DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy
and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market
conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a
scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach

Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial
applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm
relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The
advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream
task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock
prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3)
Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective
comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we
propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph
Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship
graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing
graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance.
Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available
on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock
returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity
stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task.
To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a
historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned
and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using
performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like
Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results
showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns
with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study
concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial
time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore
combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create
hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model
for future equity stock predictions.

Conclusion: 新闻标题数据对股票价格预测具有重要价值，能够显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock
prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, also known
as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded
corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from
the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a
daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector
encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the
key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and
time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling
potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were
collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar
Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference
models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings
greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and
optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.

Motivation: 金融欺诈每年造成巨大损失，传统检测方法因数据标注稀疏和模型不可解释性受限。SAGE-FIN旨在解决这两个挑战。

Method: 提出SAGE-FIN，一种半监督图神经网络模型，利用Granger因果关系解释结果，适用于低标注或无标注数据。

Conclusion: SAGE-FIN成功解决了金融欺诈检测中的标注数据稀缺和模型可解释性问题。

Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually.
Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task
that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning
(ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not
so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes
the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and
(2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML
models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes
SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with
Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns
to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points.
To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by
highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We
empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world
dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++),
with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without
any prior assumption on the network structure.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能改善人机交互，提供上下文和用户特定的解释。

Abstract: When robots perform complex and context-dependent tasks in our daily lives,
deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

Result: 模型能够仅通过正逆运动学模型学习生成轨迹，适用于需要适应性解决方案的复杂任务。

Conclusion: 自监督学习方法在机器人轨迹规划中具有潜力，能够提供高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

Conclusion: 该VLA方法不仅训练高效，还能生成可执行的机器人轨迹，同时具备良好的模拟到现实迁移能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

<details>

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 传统骨架化算法计算资源消耗大，需要一种更高效的方法来平衡响应时间、路径安全性和路径长度。

Method: 使用基于U-Net架构的深度去噪自动编码器（DDAE）生成骨架图SkelUnet，并通过一次性采样（OSS）探索整个工作空间。

Result: 在12,500张地图数据集上训练，SkelUnet在250张未见地图中表现出色，生成安全路径并显著减少处理时间。

Conclusion: SkelUnet在结构化环境中为移动服务机器人提供了高效且安全的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

Main category: cs.DC

Motivation: 边缘设备上的分布式推理需求日益增长，尤其是对于大型语言模型(LLM)。现有管线并行方法在请求稀疏时效率较低，需要一种高效解决方案。

Method: FlowSpec结合了分数验证、优化令牌管理和动态扩展策略，通过管线并行和推测解码提高推理效率。

Result: 实验结果表明，FlowSpec在多种模型和配置下显著提升推理速度，加速比为1.36×-1.77×。

Conclusion: FlowSpec通过创新方法解决了边缘设备上LLM推理的效率问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: LiTEN为复杂生物分子建模提供了高效且物理合理的框架，适用于药物发现等应用。

Abstract: Accurate atomistic biomolecular simulations are vital for disease mechanism
understanding, drug discovery, and biomaterial design, but existing simulation
methods exhibit significant limitations. Classical force fields are efficient
but lack accuracy for transition states and fine conformational details
critical in many chemical and biological processes. Quantum Mechanics (QM)
methods are highly accurate but computationally infeasible for large-scale or
long-time simulations. AI-based force fields (AIFFs) aim to achieve QM-level
accuracy with efficiency but struggle to balance many-body modeling complexity,
accuracy, and speed, often constrained by limited training data and
insufficient validation for generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce LiTEN, a novel equivariant neural network with Tensorized Quadrangle
Attention (TQA). TQA efficiently models three- and four-body interactions with
linear complexity by reparameterizing high-order tensor features via vector
operations, avoiding costly spherical harmonics. Building on LiTEN, LiTEN-FF is
a robust AIFF foundation model, pre-trained on the extensive nablaDFT dataset
for broad chemical generalization and fine-tuned on SPICE for accurate solvated
system simulations. LiTEN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across
most evaluation subsets of rMD17, MD22, and Chignolin, outperforming leading
models such as MACE, NequIP, and EquiFormer. LiTEN-FF enables the most
comprehensive suite of downstream biomolecular modeling tasks to date,
including QM-level conformer searches, geometry optimization, and free energy
surface construction, while offering 10x faster inference than MACE-OFF for
large biomolecules (~1000 atoms). In summary, we present a physically grounded,
highly efficient framework that advances complex biomolecular modeling,
providing a versatile foundation for drug discovery and related applications.

Abstract: The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range

Conclusion: 该加速求解器支持动态投资组合分配和实时期权定价中的更快决策。

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework for optimizing
block-preconditioner sizes in iterative solvers used in portfolio optimization
and option pricing. The covariance matrix in portfolio optimization or the
discretization of differential operators in option pricing models lead to large
linear systems of the form $\mathbf{A}\textbf{x}=\textbf{b}$. Direct inversion
of high-dimensional portfolio or fine-grid option pricing incurs a significant
computational cost. Therefore, iterative methods are usually used for
portfolios in real-world situations. Ill-conditioned systems, however, suffer
from slow convergence. Traditional preconditioning techniques often require
problem-specific parameter tuning. To overcome this limitation, we rely on RL
to dynamically adjust the block-preconditioner sizes and accelerate iterative
solver convergence. Evaluations on a suite of real-world portfolio optimization
matrices demonstrate that our RL framework can be used to adjust
preconditioning and significantly accelerate convergence and reduce
computational cost. The proposed accelerated solver supports faster
decision-making in dynamic portfolio allocation and real-time option pricing.
