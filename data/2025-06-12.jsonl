Through extensive experiments on\nCommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired\nwith prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded\nby input noise, yielding up to +39\\% absolute gains for weaker models like\nGemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly\nregularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct\npenalty schedules to maximize resilience.

In this work, we proposed LwPTV\n(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the\nredundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve\nmask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task\nvectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding\nlayer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly\nintegrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their\nperformance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\napplication of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD\nperformance while preserving the ability on ID tasks."}

Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than\ntheir spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of\ngenerating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign\nLanguage Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose\nleveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing\nsign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation\nmodels. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to\nproduction, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN\nand SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing\nthe performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in\nthe signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets\nand enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,\npaving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,\neven in resource-constrained environments."}

In this paper, we propose a novel online\noptimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a\nmulti-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback\nConstrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively\noptimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment\n(UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network\ncapacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations\nover a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the\nproportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19%\nthroughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming\nstandard network settings following 3GPP recommendations."}

Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned\nfrom data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are\nnot identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior\nunder new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer\nthe system. It is known in the community that \"linear ordinary differential\nequations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory.\"\nHowever, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains\nunderexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally\nin many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this\ngap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to\nthe dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive\nprobability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds\nfor this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical\nunidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs\nfrom data.

We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward.

One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring\nthe dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer\ndetection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g.\nin the company named GRAIL.\n  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for\ndetecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our\napproach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics\nof ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient\ntesting procedures.

This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility.

Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within\nOctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,\nwe build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce\nlow-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a\nHybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,\nAction-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains\nspecifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT\nand Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which\nshow impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to\ninvestigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation\nfield, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists.

In\nidentifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a\nstraightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this\ncase, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic\nuncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$.

To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage.

Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an\nenhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and\ndense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian\nrepresentation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view\nsynthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network\nthat achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves\ndynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,\nwhile significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic\nreconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded\n3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking\ntasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D\ntracking methods."}
