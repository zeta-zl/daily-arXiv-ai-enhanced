We\ncompare a rule-based algorithm (RBA), RadBERT, and three lightweight\nopen-weight LLMs for multi-disease labeling of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP)\nCT reports.\n  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 40,833 CT reports\nfrom 29,540 patients, with 1,789 CAP reports manually annotated across three\norgan systems. External validation was conducted using the CT-RATE dataset.\nThree open-weight LLMs were tested with zero-shot prompting. Performance was\nevaluated using Cohen's Kappa and micro/macro-averaged F1 scores.\n  Results: In 12,197 Duke CAP reports from 8,854 patients, Llama-3.1 8B and\nGemma-3 27B showed the highest agreement ($\\kappa$ median: 0.87). On the\nmanually annotated set, Gemma-3 27B achieved the top macro-F1 (0.82), followed\nby Llama-3.1 8B (0.79), while the RBA scored lowest (0.64). On the CT-RATE\ndataset (lungs/pleura only), Llama-3.1 8B performed best (0.91), with Gemma-3\n27B close behind (0.89). Performance differences were mainly due to differing\nlabeling practices, especially for lung atelectasis.\n  Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs outperform rule-based methods for CT report\nannotation and generalize across organ systems with zero-shot prompting.\nHowever, binary labels alone cannot capture the full nuance of report language.\nLLMs can provide a flexible, efficient solution aligned with clinical judgment\nand user needs."}

However, existing methods rely on joint training of the\nguidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the\nearly stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning\nsignals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations,\nactions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior,\nsuggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular\ntraining methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model,\nbased on three key findings:\n  Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with\nthe training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and\ndiffusion.

With\nreinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning\ntasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash\nthese models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but\nalso unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a\ncritical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning\npotential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that\nCritique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the\nreasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting\ndiverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to\nprovide detailed critiques.

Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor\nsustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for\nevery problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is\nvital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other\ndomains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on\nfusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from\ndifferent datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not\nhold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we\nformally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its\nunique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single\ndomain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models\nand Data layers, answering three key questions: \"what to fuse\", \"why can be\nfused\", and \"how to fuse\". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from\ndifferent domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy\nof knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures. The Models Layer\nprovides two knowledge fusion paradigms based on the fundamental mechanisms for\nprocessing data.

MambaAttention demonstrated the highest overall\nperformance (F1-scores: 88% for SAE 1, 97% for SAE 2, and 99% for SAE 3-5),\nwhile TabPFN excelled in zero-shot inference with high robustness for rare\ncrash categories. In contrast, TabTransformer underperformed, particularly in\ndetecting Partial Automation crashes (F1-score: 55%), suggesting challenges in\nmodeling shared human-system control dynamics. These results highlight the\ncapability of deep learning models tailored for tabular data to enhance the\naccuracy and efficiency of automation-level classification. Integrating such\nmodels into crash analysis frameworks can support policy development, AV safety\nevaluation, and regulatory decisions, especially in distinguishing high-risk\nconditions for mid- and high-level automation technologies."}

Although\nquantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social\ntheory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive\nmodels or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications\nof quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses\nthat gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines\nquantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of\nsocial norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition,\nentanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a\ndynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These\nscenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving\nroles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment\nmonitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to\nsurveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions\nallow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent\npatterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with\ngenerative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and\ninterdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns\nincluding convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the\nspontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this\nstudy introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a\nquantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how\nsociety can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic\nsystem to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies."}

The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the\ntime domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate\nattributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and\nfrequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This\nsuggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more\ncomprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain\nexplanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty\nprinciple (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in\nharmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature.

The relation between the multi-objective performance space\nand the parameter space that represents the policies is generally non-unique.\nUsing a training scheme that is based on a locally linear map between the\nparameter space and the performance space, we show that an approximate Pareto\nfront can provide an interpretation of the current parameter vectors in terms\nof the objectives which enables an effective search within contiguous solution\ndomains.

With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has\nprimarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to\nsolve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we\nstill need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle\ndiverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual\nlearning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is\nstill necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating\nknowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information;\n(ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise,\nadapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints\nwithout full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long\ncontext-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular\napproach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and\nagents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted.

To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named\nTokAlign to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view,\nand further transfer the token-level knowledge between models.

This raises a\nnatural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better\nreasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget.

In this model, we explore the power of a strategic litigator, who\nstrategically brings cases to the higher court to influence the learned\ndecision rule, thereby affecting future cases. We explore questions including:\nWhat impact can a strategic litigator have? Which cases should a strategic\nlitigator bring to court? Does it ever make sense for a strategic litigator to\nbring a case when they are sure the court will rule against them?"}

To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input.

It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to\ndistinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may\neasily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce\nAutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to\nenhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised\nmanner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description\nprompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within\nan image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic\nself-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve\nthe description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level\nclassification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to\nMLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our\napproach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently\noutperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nour self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average\nimproves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over\nthe best-performing baselines. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/yq-hong/AutoSEP"}

In order to mitigate the\nprivacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with\nfederated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research\nmainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain\ngradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However,\nthese approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct\nthe gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy\nof model classification. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a\nnovel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances\nrigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient\ncorrection mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and\nnoise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local\ngradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the\nnegative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the\nalignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model towards\nconvergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark\ndatasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget."}

Code: https://github.com/weizhepei/AdaDecode", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content\ngeneration (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency\nbecomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by\nits sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated\nbefore the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the\nability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities.\nExisting methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential\nspeedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an\nauxiliary \"drafter\" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases\nmemory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the\noutputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we\npropose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary\nmodels or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output\nconsistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be\ngenerated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly\nalter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively\ngenerating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode\nenables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer\ncomputations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel\nwith subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and\nreducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early\npredictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving\noutput parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode\nconsistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup,\nwhile guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding."}

The\nrecent volume hypothesis challenges this view: it posits that these\ngeneralization abilities persist even when gradient descent is replaced by\nGuess & Check (G&C), i.e., by drawing weight settings until one that fits the\ntraining data is found. The validity of the volume hypothesis for wide and deep\nneural networks remains an open question. In this paper, we theoretically\ninvestigate this question for matrix factorization (with linear and non-linear\nactivation)--a common testbed in neural network theory. We first prove that\ngeneralization under G&C deteriorates with increasing width, establishing what\nis, to our knowledge, the first case where G&C is provably inferior to gradient\ndescent. Conversely, we prove that generalization under G&C improves with\nincreasing depth, revealing a stark contrast between wide and deep networks,\nwhich we further validate empirically.

We conduct an\nempirical analysis of these trade-offs on PPO, one of the most popular RL\nalgorithms that uses parallel actors, and establish connections to network\nplasticity and, more generally, optimization stability. We examine its impact\non network architectures, as well as the hyper-parameter sensitivity when\nscaling data. Our analyses indicate that larger dataset sizes can increase\nfinal performance across a variety of settings, and that scaling parallel\nenvironments is more effective than increasing rollout lengths. These findings\nhighlight the critical role of data collection strategies in improving agent\nperformance."}

Objectives: (1) To\nconstruct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health\nagent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the\nvalidity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient\nSimulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation\nframework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven\nsimulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system.\nMethods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient\nvignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of\npresenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance\nof the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across\nover 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AI agent to\nprovide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The\nresulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians.\nResults: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient\nvignettes in those same 97.7% of cases.

This paper\ndevelops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to\novercome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value\npropagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC)\nframework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions\nC-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal\nhuman interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to\nintegrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that\nmaximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently\nand continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a\npolicy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return\ndistribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and\nself-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This\nensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and\nperformance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios\nreveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of\nsafety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated through\nreal-world road tests in complex traffic conditions. The videos and code are\navailable at: https://github.com/lzqw/C-HAC."}

Despite its success, Shampoo relies heavily on several\nheuristics such as learning rate grafting and stale preconditioning to achieve\nperformance at-scale. These heuristics increase algorithmic complexity,\nnecessitate further hyperparameter tuning, and lack theoretical justification.\nThis paper investigates these heuristics from the angle of Frobenius norm\napproximation to full-matrix Adam and decouples the preconditioner's\neigenvalues and eigenbasis updates. We show that grafting from Adam mitigates\nthe staleness and mis-scaling of the preconditioner's eigenvalues and how\ncorrecting the eigenvalues directly can eliminate the need for learning rate\ngrafting. To manage the error induced by infrequent eigenbasis computations, we\npropose an adaptive criterion for determining the eigenbasis computation\nfrequency motivated by terminating a warm-started QR algorithm. This criterion\ndecouples the update frequency of different preconditioner matrices and enables\nus to investigate the impact of approximation error on convergence. These\npractical techniques offer a principled angle towards removing Shampoo's\nheuristics and developing improved Kronecker-factorization-based training\nalgorithms."}

In this work, we study the problem of CoT\ncondensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning\nintermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling\nsupervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both\nanswer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our\nrationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem\nunderstanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical\nanalysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,\nespecially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)\nand the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless\nreasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation\nmethod, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of\neach CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an\nanalogy to preserving the \"edge\" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the\ninitial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical\ncontinuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and\nbenchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving\nlossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision.

By modeling how parts relate to each other in a\ncontinuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid\nstructural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and\ndeformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object\ndetection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based\nmethods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on\nglobal classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking\nfree from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for\nuniversal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural\nimages to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and\naudio."}

Despite its success, ICL suffers from several\nlimitations, including sensitivity to demonstration order, context length\nconstraints, and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, task\nvector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.\nHowever, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of\ndemonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the\nspecific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective\nadaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying\ndemonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on\nunseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors\n(ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors\nconditioned on each input query. ATV employs a small language model to generate\ntask vectors, which are then transformed to match the target LLM's architecture\nand applied to guide its output generation. In contrast to ICL and previous\nvector-based approaches, which rely on fixed demonstration sets and their\ncorresponding vectors, ATV dynamically generates task vectors tailored to each\nspecific input query and task. Consequently, ATV demonstrates strong\nperformance and generalization capabilities, even for unseen tasks.\nFurthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis indicating that ATV is\nexpressively equivalent to LoRA under equal rank budgets and more expressive\nthan Prefix-Tuning, thereby offering formal support for its representational\nadvantage."}

To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study\nacross models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial\nperformance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to\n\"overthinking\". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple\nprobabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output\nvariance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately\nundermining precision. Thus, observed gains from \"more thinking\" are not true\nindicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection\nbetween model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time\nscaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the\ninference thinking budget.

While cryptographic solutions offer\npromise, they often suffer from high communication overhead or require\ncentralization in the presence of network failures. Conversely, existing fully\ndecentralized approaches typically rely on relaxed adversarial models or\npairwise noise cancellation, the latter suffering from substantial accuracy\ndegradation if parties unexpectedly disconnect. In this work, we propose IncA,\na new protocol for fully decentralized mean estimation, a widely used primitive\nin data-intensive processing. Our protocol, which enforces differential\nprivacy, requires no central orchestration and employs low-variance correlated\nnoise, achieved by incrementally injecting sensitive information into the\ncomputation. First, we theoretically demonstrate that, when no parties\npermanently disconnect, our protocol achieves accuracy comparable to that of a\ncentralized setting-already an improvement over most existing decentralized\ndifferentially private techniques.

In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able\nto solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient\ndata, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL\nalgorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously\nunsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL\ndatasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL\nalgorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum\nperformance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor\nscaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several\nanalysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental\nbarrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction\ntechniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks.

Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high\nsample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL,\non the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper\nintroduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex\nembodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic\nlatent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized\nunsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction,\ndisentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream\nlearning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action\ninterface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream\ntasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing\nmethods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body\ntasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any\ndemonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

Overlap requires the existence\nof randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many\ntypes of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,\nobservational studies with deterministic treatment decisions -- popularly known\nas Regression Discontinuity designs -- violate overlap.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the\nidentification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond\nunconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of\nstatistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is\nsufficient and nearly necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this\ncondition characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on\nthe treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as\nwell. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several\nwell-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove\nthat ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For\nexample, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the\nmodels proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression\nDiscontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960).\nFor each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional\nassumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.\n  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic\ninsights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational\nstudies with complex treatment mechanisms."}

Given\nan instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a\nlong context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,\naiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while\nreducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research\nquestion: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)\nin the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated\noutput by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various\nreal-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting\npost-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,\nknowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources\nto enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied\nto context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution\nmethods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large\ncomputational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context\ntraceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods.

The work\nDeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the\nLocally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three\nclosed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and\nare exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility.

In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel\nparadigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real\ndatasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic\nobservations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key\nidea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by\ngenerating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and\nspeed.
