We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

Previous work\nwere mainly based on the perspective of spectrum-preserving, using some\npredefined coarsening rules to make the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of\nthe original graph and the coarsened graph match as much as possible. However,\nthey largely overlooked the fact that the original graph is composed of\nsubregions at different levels of granularity, where highly connected and\nsimilar nodes should be more inclined to be aggregated together as nodes in the\ncoarsened graph.

Specifically, GBGC introduces an adaptive\ngranular-ball graph refinement mechanism, which adaptively splits the original\ngraph from coarse to fine into granular-balls of different sizes and optimal\ngranularity, and constructs the coarsened graph using these granular-balls as\nsupernodes. In addition, compared with other state-of-the-art graph coarsening\nmethods, the processing speed of this method can be increased by tens to\nhundreds of times and has lower time complexity. The accuracy of GBGC is almost\nalways higher than that of the original graph due to the good robustness and\ngeneralization of the granular-ball computing, so it has the potential to\nbecome a standard graph data preprocessing method."}

Our\nframework introduces perspective-taking to infer clients' psychological states\nand support needs, enabling the generation of emotionally resonant responses.\nIn addition, phase recognition is incorporated to ensure alignment with the\ncounseling process and to prevent contextually inappropriate or inopportune\nresponses. Experiments conducted in both Japanese and Chinese counseling\nsettings demonstrate that EmoStage improves the quality of responses generated\nby base models and performs competitively with data-driven methods."}

However, this subjective\nevaluation is prone to inter- and intra-rater variability, and does not offer\ninsights into individual motor characteristics captured during this test. This\npaper introduces a granular computer vision-based method for quantifying PD\nmotor characteristics from video recordings. Four sets of clinically relevant\nfeatures are proposed to characterize hypokinesia, bradykinesia, sequence\neffect, and hesitation-halts. We evaluate our approach on video recordings and\nclinical evaluations of 74 PD patients from the Personalized Parkinson Project.\nPrincipal component analysis with varimax rotation shows that the video-based\nfeatures corresponded to the four deficits. Additionally, video-based analysis\nhas allowed us to identify further granular distinctions within sequence effect\nand hesitation-halts deficits. In the following, we have used these features to\ntrain machine learning classifiers to estimate the Movement Disorder Society\nUnified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) finger-tapping score.\nCompared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method achieves a higher accuracy\nin MDS-UPDRS score prediction, while still providing an interpretable\nquantification of individual finger-tapping motor characteristics.

This commentary, while\nacknowledging the study's methodological rigor, contends that this conclusion\nis confounded by experimental artifacts. We argue that the observed failure is\nnot evidence of a fundamental cognitive boundary, but rather a predictable\noutcome of system-level constraints in the static, text-only evaluation\nparadigm, including tool use restrictions, context window recall issues, the\nabsence of crucial cognitive baselines, inadequate statistical reporting, and\noutput generation limits. We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence. The illusion\nof thinking attributed to LRMs is less a reasoning deficit and more a\nconsequence of an otherwise capable mind lacking the tools for action."}

Notably, our Skywork-SWE model achieves 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on\nthe SWE-bench Verified benchmark without using verifiers or multiple rollouts,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based\nLLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework. Furthermore, with the\nincorporation of test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves\nto 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SOTA results for sub-32B parameter\nmodels. We release the Skywork-SWE-32B model checkpoint to accelerate future\nresearch."}

Unlike prior work focusing on\nsentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis\nby operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the\nconsistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into\nsemantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to\ncompare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of\nsubtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and\nvalidate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender,\nrace, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced\nbiases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming\nvarious evaluation metrics."}

AAD has been researched in the literature\nextensively; however, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first\nsystematic literature review (SLR) on the current research within this field.\nWe present a comprehensive SLR, gathering 397 relevant papers and\nsystematically analyzing 65 of them (47 research and 18 survey papers) on AAD\nin CPS studies from 2013 to 2023 (November). We introduce a novel taxonomy\nconsidering attack types, CPS application, learning paradigm, data management,\nand algorithms. Our analysis indicates, among other findings, that reviewed\nworks focused on a single aspect of adaptation (either data processing or model\nadaptation) but rarely in both at the same time.

We reframe this performance collapse through the lens\nof an agentic gap, asserting that the models are not failing at reasoning, but\nat execution within a profoundly restrictive interface. We empirically\nsubstantiate this critique by demonstrating a striking reversal. A model,\ninitially declaring a puzzle impossible when confined to text-only generation,\nnow employs agentic tools to not only solve it but also master variations of\ncomplexity far beyond the reasoning cliff it previously failed to surmount.\nAdditionally, our empirical analysis of tool-enabled models like o4-mini and\nGPT-4o reveals a hierarchy of agentic reasoning, from simple procedural\nexecution to complex meta-cognitive self-correction, which has significant\nimplications for how we define and measure machine intelligence.

Furthermore, a transfer learning\nmodel (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the\nradar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of\ncardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to\nfine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results\nreveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and\nthe RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using\na small number of radar-ECG pairs for training.

For\nintuition, we introduce a simpler score flow and show that for orthogonal\ndatasets, both flows follow similar trajectories, converging to a training\npoint or a sum of training points. However, early stopping by the diffusion\ntime scheduler allows probability flow to reach more general manifold points.\nThis reflects the tendency of diffusion models to both memorize training\nsamples and generate novel points that combine aspects of multiple samples,\nmotivating our study of such behavior in simplified settings. We extend these\nresults to obtuse simplex data and, through simulations in the orthogonal case,\nconfirm that probability flow converges to a training point, a sum of training\npoints, or a manifold point.

This critical reliability\ngap poses substantial risks in safety-critical Artificial Intelligence (AI)\napplications, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation benchmark and effective\ndetection methods. Firstly, we observe that existing visual-centric\nhallucination benchmarks mainly assess LVLMs from a perception perspective,\noverlooking hallucinations arising from advanced reasoning capabilities. We\ndevelop the Perception-Reasoning Evaluation Hallucination (PRE-HAL) dataset,\nwhich enables the systematic evaluation of both perception and reasoning\ncapabilities of LVLMs across multiple visual semantics, such as instances,\nscenes, and relations. Comprehensive evaluation with this new benchmark exposed\nmore visual vulnerabilities, particularly in the more challenging task of\nrelation reasoning. To address this issue, we propose, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first Dempster-Shafer theory (DST)-based visual hallucination\ndetection method for LVLMs through uncertainty estimation. This method aims to\nefficiently capture the degree of conflict in high-level features at the model\ninference phase.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\nhave been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated\nto clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the\nincreasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning\nguidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet\nbeen explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for\nultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for\nultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a\ntransformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object\ndetection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user\nquery is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through\nLLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding\nultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,\nassisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical\nexploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning\nguidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,\nincluding the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers.

In\nKling-Foley, we introduce multimodal diffusion transformers to model the\ninteractions between video, audio, and text modalities, and combine it with a\nvisual semantic representation module and an audio-visual synchronization\nmodule to enhance alignment capabilities. Specifically, these modules align\nvideo conditions with latent audio elements at the frame level, thereby\nimproving semantic alignment and audio-visual synchronization. Together with\ntext conditions, this integrated approach enables precise generation of\nvideo-matching sound effects.

Using naive variants of differential privacy in\nsuch use cases can result in unnecessary degradation of utility. In this work,\nwe refine the definition of DP to create a more general and flexible framework\nthat we call feature differential privacy (FDP). Our definition is\nsimulation-based and allows for both addition/removal and replacement variants\nof privacy, and can handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and\nnon-protected features. We prove the properties of FDP, such as adaptive\ncomposition, and demonstrate its implications for limiting attribute inference\nattacks. We also propose a modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm that\nsatisfies FDP while leveraging desirable properties such as amplification via\nsub-sampling. We apply our framework to various machine learning tasks and show\nthat it can significantly improve the utility of DP-trained models when public\nfeatures are available. For example, we train diffusion models on the AFHQ\ndataset of animal faces and observe a drastic improvement in FID compared to\nDP, from 286.7 to 101.9 at $\\epsilon=8$, assuming that the blurred version of a\ntraining image is available as a public feature.

In the real\nworld, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with\nthe same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same\npatterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation\npreference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness.\nDiffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great\nsuccess in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and\nrepresent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of\nadaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore,\nwe use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the\ndiversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model\nbased on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the\noriginal distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition\nmodel, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse\nreconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is\ncompleted by injecting multi-interests representational information that\neliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In\nthe inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition\nby using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to\nreconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments\non three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on\naccuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes\nthe degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation."}
