However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages.

Previous research shows that using\ntest-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can\neffectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning\nmethods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,\npreventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose\nPERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for\nlearning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight\nmodel adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization\nloops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a\nlow-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for\nthe base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter\nto accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long\ncontext. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK\nsignificantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,\nachieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models\n(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In\ngeneral, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and\nthe locations of relevant information in contexts.

This paper\naddresses this challenge by introducing eegFloss, an open-source Python package\nto utilize eegUsability, a novel machine learning (ML) model designed to detect\nsegments with artifacts in sleep EEG recordings. eegUsability has been trained\nand evaluated on manually artifact-labeled EEG data collected from 15\nparticipants over 127 nights using the Zmax headband. It demonstrates solid\noverall classification performance (F1-score is approximately 0.85, Cohens\nkappa is 0.78), achieving a high recall rate of approximately 94% in\nidentifying channel-wise usable EEG data, and extends beyond Zmax.\nAdditionally, eegFloss offers features such as automatic time-in-bed detection\nusing another ML model named eegMobility, filtering out certain artifacts, and\ngenerating hypnograms and sleep statistics. By addressing a fundamental\nchallenge faced by most sleep studies, eegFloss can enhance the precision and\nrigor of their analysis as well as the accuracy and reliability of their\noutcomes."}

We propose a family of approaches: (1)\n\\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent\npolicies via competitive self-play; (2) \\textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play\n(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and\n(3) the most promising variant, \\textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},\ncreates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of\nNSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a\ncontinuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety\nsimulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car\nTag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and\nheuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy\nquality, \\ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In\nGandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through\nand jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.\nFurthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered\nvulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of\nimproving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more\ncreative and open-ended strategy discovery"}

Our MMKG links 13,000\nrecipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate\n40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint\nfine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves\nBERTScore by 16.2\\%, reduces FID by 37.8\\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by\n31.1\\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\\% to 7.3\\%) and\nLLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid\nretrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\\% accurate image reuse and 85\\%\nadequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and\nmultimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA."}

However, the\nfocus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global\ntopological information and increased risk of node-specific information being\noverwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign\nnodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class\nimbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of\nimbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior\nobfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation,\nwe propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate\nMessage imbalance in Fraud Detection(MimbFD). Specifically, we design a\ntopological message reachability module for high-quality node representation\nlearning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient\npropagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust\nnode representations, enhancing the stable association between node\nrepresentations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.\nFinally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the\nresults demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud\ndetection."}

In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet\neffective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers.

In this\npaper, we first introduce powerful diffusion models into the federated learning\nparadigm and show that diffusion representations are effective steers during\nfederated training. To explore the possibility of using diffusion\nrepresentations in handling data heterogeneity, we propose a novel\ndiffusion-inspired Federated paradigm with Diffusion Representation\nCollaboration, termed FedDifRC, leveraging meaningful guidance of diffusion\nmodels to mitigate data heterogeneity. The key idea is to construct text-driven\ndiffusion contrasting and noise-driven diffusion regularization, aiming to\nprovide abundant class-related semantic information and consistent convergence\nsignals. On the one hand, we exploit the conditional feedback from the\ndiffusion model for different text prompts to build a text-driven contrastive\nlearning strategy. On the other hand, we introduce a noise-driven consistency\nregularization to align local instances with diffusion denoising\nrepresentations, constraining the optimization region in the feature space. In\naddition, FedDifRC can be extended to a self-supervised scheme without relying\non any labeled data.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

Through a model-building thought experiment that\nconverts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core\ndilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and\nabstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding\nundermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like\ninstructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the\ntension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the\nchallenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become\nobscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents\ntowards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social\nmechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.\nThis exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,\nrather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the\nconditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence\nis not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions\nunfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than\nlong-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the\necosystem of social simulation for future applications."}

By extending an existing\nnotion of \\textit{hypothesis set stability}, to \\textit{trajectory stability},\nwe prove that the generalization error of trajectory-stable algorithms can be\nupper bounded in terms of (i) TDA quantities describing the complexity of the\ntrajectory of the optimizer in the parameter space, and (ii) the trajectory\nstability parameter of the algorithm. Through a series of experimental\nevaluations, we demonstrate that the TDA terms in the bound are of great\nimportance, especially as the number of training samples grows. This ultimately\nforms an explanation of the empirical success of the topological generalization\nbounds."}

Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to\nsubstantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot\nbe directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,\nUS speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body\nmicrostructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that\nobtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by\npioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also\ncannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency.

Project page:\n  https://anitaleungxx.github.io/ReMix", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the\nreasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most\nexisting Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL\nin nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully\nutilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,\nposing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To\nthis end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating\nMix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable\non-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix\nconsists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient\nwith an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)\nKL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and\nflexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from\nefficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our\nexperiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base\nmodels. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with\n0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B\nmodel) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math\nreasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and\nMATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level\nperformance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of\nrollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via\nmultifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses\ndue to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of\nself-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc."}

However, their close integration with personal devices\nraises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor\nattacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual\ngrounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce\nvulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack\ntargeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when\ngiven correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose\nVisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to\nlocate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.\nVisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and\ndoes so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical\nfeasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can\neffectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and\nhighly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack\ncan be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning.

We model the uncertainty that the learner faces by a\ndistribution $\\pi$ in the ground-truth triples $(p, q, f)$ -- which we call a\nUDA class -- where $(p, q)$ is the source -- target distribution pair and $f$\nis the classifier. We define the performance of a learner as the overall target\ndomain risk, averaged over the randomness of the ground-truth triple. This\nformulation couples the source distribution, the target distribution and the\nclassifier in the ground truth, and deviates from the classical worst-case\nanalyses, which pessimistically emphasize the impact of hard but rare UDA\ninstances. In this formulation, we precisely characterize the optimal learner.\nThe performance of the optimal learner then allows us to define the learning\ndifficulty for the UDA class and for the observed sample.

Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values\nas objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while\nleveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure\ncontrol signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D\nnavigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves\nsuperior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of\npolicy distributions.

In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is\nimportant to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.\nHowever, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so\neffectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for\nthe supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy\nsupervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk\n$O(\\eta)$ below $\\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily\n$d_N\\log d_N\\gtrsim N_s \\eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$\nis the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies\nto the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled\nnoisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone\ndoes not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show\nempirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\\sigma^2$\nunder such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the\nHamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE.

Although\natmospheric forcing and basal melting have been widely studied, the direct\nimpact of sea ice retreat on AIS mass loss remains underexplored. Traditional\nmodels treat sea ice and AIS as separate systems. It limits their ability to\ncapture localized linkages and cascading feedback. To overcome this, we propose\nSpatial-Link, a novel graph-based framework that quantifies spatial\nheterogeneity to capture linkages between sea ice retreat and AIS melt. Our\nmethod constructs a spatial graph using Delaunay triangulation of\nsatellite-derived ice change matrices, where nodes represent regions of\nsignificant change and edges encode proximity and directional consistency. We\nextract and statistically validate linkage paths using breadth-first search and\nMonte Carlo simulations. Results reveal non-local, spatially heterogeneous\ncoupling patterns, suggesting sea ice loss can initiate or amplify downstream\nAIS melt. Our analysis shows how sea ice retreat evolves over an oceanic grid\nand progresses toward ice shelves-establishing a direct linkage. To our\nknowledge, this is the first proposed methodology linking sea ice retreat to\nAIS melt. Spatial-Link offers a scalable, data-driven tool to improve sea-level\nrise projections and inform climate adaptation strategies."}

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning\nhave become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI\nface challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to\nsubjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology\ncaptions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce\na novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from\nhistopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor\ngenerates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically\nclustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting\nrepresentative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph\nby connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and\napply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The\naggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space\nthrough a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large\nlanguage model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric\ndatasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for\nclassification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569\nfor captioning.

To fill the gap, this study\nintroduces an interpretable stochastic modeling framework that captures not\nonly context-dependent dynamics but also residual variability beyond what\ncontext can explain. Leveraging deep neural networks integrated with\nnonstationary Gaussian processes (GPs), our model employs a scenario-adaptive\nGibbs kernel to learn dynamic temporal correlations in acceleration decisions,\nwhere the strength and duration of correlations between acceleration decisions\nevolve with the driving context.

This\npaper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:\ndistillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,\nwe propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework\nfeaturing a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse\nensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal\nconfigurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that\nfacilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively\ntranscends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and\nstatic teacher models.

These proofs convince the user that the ML model output is\ncorrect, without revealing the weights of the model to the user. Past work on\nthese provers can be placed into two categories. The first method compiles the\nML model into a low-level circuit, and proves the circuit using a ZK-SNARK. The\nsecond method uses custom cryptographic protocols designed only for a specific\nclass of models. Unfortunately, the first method is highly inefficient, making\nit impractical for the large models used today, and the second method does not\ngeneralize well, making it difficult to update in the rapidly changing field of\nmachine learning. To solve this, we propose ZKTorch, an open source end-to-end\nproving system that compiles ML models into base cryptographic operations\ncalled basic blocks, each proved using specialized protocols.
