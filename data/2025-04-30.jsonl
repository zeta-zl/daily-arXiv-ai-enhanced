We introduce Meta Policy Optimization (MPO), a\nframework that addresses these challenges by integrating a meta-reward model\nthat dynamically refines the reward model's prompt throughout training. In MPO,\nthe meta-reward model monitors the evolving training context and continuously\nadjusts the reward model's prompt to maintain high alignment, providing an\nadaptive reward signal that resists exploitation by the policy. This\nmeta-learning approach promotes a more stable policy optimization, and greatly\nreduces the need for manual reward prompt design. It yields performance on par\nwith or better than models guided by extensively hand-crafted reward prompts.\nFurthermore, we show that MPO maintains its effectiveness across diverse tasks,\nsuch as question answering and mathematical reasoning, without requiring\nspecialized reward designs. Beyond standard RLAIF, MPO's meta-learning\nformulation is readily extensible to higher-level alignment frameworks.\nOverall, this method addresses theoretical and practical challenges in\nreward-based RL alignment for LLMs, paving the way for more robust and\nadaptable alignment strategies.

Moreover, AS-ARMs\nsupport parallelized joint probability density estimation, allowing them to\ncorrect their own parallel-generated token distributions, via our Any-Subset\nSpeculative Decoding (ASSD) algorithm. ASSD provably enables generation of\ntokens from the correct joint distribution, with the number of neural network\ncalls upper bounded by the number of tokens predicted. We empirically verify\nthat ASSD speeds up language generation, without sacrificing quality.\nFurthermore, we provide a mathematically justified scheme for training AS-ARMs\nfor generation, and show that AS-ARMs achieve state-of-the-art performance\namong sub-200M parameter models on infilling benchmark tasks, and nearly match\nthe performance of models 50X larger on code generation. Our theoretical and\nempirical results indicate that the once-forgotten AS-ARMs are a promising\ndirection of language modeling."}

The primary challenge in OCIL lies in maintaining a good balance\nbetween the knowledge of old and new classes within the continually updated\nmodel. Most existing methods rely on explicit knowledge interaction through\nexperience replay, and often employ exclusive training separation to address\nbias problems. Nevertheless, it still remains a big challenge to achieve a\nwell-balanced learner, as these methods often exhibit either reduced plasticity\nor limited stability due to difficulties in continually integrating knowledge\nin the OCIL setting.

Deep learning models have recently\nshown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property\nrelationships.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by\npretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can\nbe fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose\nsupervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate\nlabels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material\nproperties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and\nintroduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance\nrepresentation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that\ninjects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material\ngraphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging\nmaterial property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over\nbaselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE)\nand establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate that, despite having fewer trainable parameters, the Hybrid Quantum\nRecurrent Neural Network achieves up to a 5% improvement over a Recurrent\nNeural Network based on stacked Long Short-Term Memory layers in terms of mean\nroot mean squared error and mean absolute error. Moreover, a thorough\ncomparison of our method with established techniques, including Random Forest,\nConvolutional Neural Network, and Multilayer Perceptron, demonstrates that our\napproach, which achieves a Root Mean Squared Error of 15.46, surpasses these\nbaselines by approximately 13.68%, 16.21%, and 7.87%, respectively.\nNevertheless, it remains outperformed by certain advanced joint architectures.\nOur findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for\nrobust time-series forecasting under limited data conditions, offering new\navenues for enhancing reliability in predictive maintenance tasks."}

However, recent\nstudies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial\nattacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real\nworld, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks\nand enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of\nthese defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural\nbias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail\nnodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes\nwith low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\ndefense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN\naugmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to\nmitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the\nhetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e.,\nlinks connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic\nlinks (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low\ndegree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is\nadopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of\ngraph views. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the defense and\ndebiasing effect of the proposed strategy on benchmark datasets."}

This paper focuses on capturing the dataset shift from user\nbehavior and domain distribution changing over time. We propose an Incremental\nCausal Effect with Proxy Knowledge Distillation (ICE-PKD) framework to tackle\nthis challenge. The ICE-PKD framework includes two components: (i) a\nmulti-treatment uplift network that eliminates confounding bias using\ncounterfactual regression; (ii) an incremental training strategy that adapts to\nthe temporal dataset shift by updating with the latest data and protects\ngeneralization via replay-based knowledge distillation. We also revisit the\nuplift modeling metrics and introduce a novel metric for more precise online\nevaluation in multiple treatment scenarios. Extensive experiments on both\nsimulated and online datasets show that the proposed framework achieves better\nperformance. The ICE-PKD framework has been deployed in the marketing system of\nHuaxiaozhu, a ride-hailing platform in China."}

We extract a potential answer\nfrom every completed continuation originating from different subthoughts. We\nfind that aggregating these answers by selecting the most frequent one (the\nmode) often yields significantly higher accuracy compared to relying solely on\nthe answer derived from the original complete trace. Analyzing the consistency\namong the answers derived from different subthoughts reveals characteristics\nthat correlate with the model's confidence and correctness, suggesting\npotential for identifying less reliable answers. Our experiments across various\nLLMs and challenging mathematical reasoning datasets (AIME2024 and AIME2025)\nshow consistent accuracy improvements, with gains reaching up to 13\\% and 10\\%\nrespectively.

However, recent\nstudies have found that current GNNs are susceptible to malicious adversarial\nattacks. Given the inevitable presence of adversarial attacks in the real\nworld, a variety of defense methods have been proposed to counter these attacks\nand enhance the robustness of GNNs. Despite the commendable performance of\nthese defense methods, we have observed that they tend to exhibit a structural\nbias in terms of their defense capability on nodes with low degree (i.e., tail\nnodes), which is similar to the structural bias of traditional GNNs on nodes\nwith low degree in the clean graph. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\ndefense strategy by including hetero-homo augmented graph construction, $k$NN\naugmented graph construction, and multi-view node-wise attention modules to\nmitigate the structural bias of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Notably, the\nhetero-homo augmented graph consists of removing heterophilic links (i.e.,\nlinks connecting nodes with dissimilar features) globally and adding homophilic\nlinks (i.e., links connecting nodes with similar features) for nodes with low\ndegree. To further enhance the defense capability, an attention mechanism is\nadopted to adaptively combine the representations from the above two kinds of\ngraph views.

Data heterogeneity is identified as\none of the major challenges in modern day large-scale learning. A classical way\nto represent heterogeneous data is via a mixture model. In this paper, we study\ngeneralization performance and statistical rates when data is sampled from a\nmixture distribution. We first characterize the heterogeneity of the mixture in\nterms of the pairwise total variation distance of the sub-population\ndistributions. Thereafter, as a central theme of this paper, we characterize\nthe range where the mixture may be treated as a single (homogeneous)\ndistribution for learning. In particular, we study the generalization\nperformance under the classical PAC framework and the statistical error rates\nfor parametric (linear regression, mixture of hyperplanes) as well as\nnon-parametric (Lipschitz, convex and H\\\"older-smooth) regression problems. In\norder to do this, we obtain Rademacher complexity and (local) Gaussian\ncomplexity bounds with mixture data, and apply them to get the generalization\nand convergence rates respectively. We observe that as the (regression)\nfunction classes get more complex, the requirement on the pairwise total\nvariation distance gets stringent, which matches our intuition. We also do a\nfiner analysis for the case of mixed linear regression and provide a tight\nbound on the generalization error in terms of heterogeneity."}

This paper introduces a principled framework for shifting\nfrom expectation-based evaluation to an alternative reward formulation, termed\na preference metric (PM). The PMs can place the desired emphasis on different\nreward realization and can encode a richer modeling of preferences that\nincorporate risk aversion, robustness, or other desired attitudes toward\nuncertainty. A fundamentally distinct observation in such a PM-centric\nperspective is that designing bandit algorithms will have a significantly\ndifferent principle: as opposed to the reward-based models in which the optimal\nsampling policy converges to repeatedly sampling from the single best arm, in\nthe PM-centric framework the optimal policy converges to selecting a mix of\narms based on specific mixing weights. Designing such mixture policies departs\nfrom the principles for designing bandit algorithms in significant ways,\nprimarily because of uncountable mixture possibilities. The paper formalizes\nthe PM-centric framework and presents two algorithm classes (horizon-dependent\nand anytime) that learn and track mixtures in a regret-efficient fashion.
