To achieve OOD through composition, a system must\ndiscover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output\nmappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an\nintelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable\ninput features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act\nbased not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the\ntask-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to\nconfirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data,\nit is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm\nthat the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by\nexploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable\nby three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop\ntwo novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be\nsuccessful in OOD scenarios.

We argue that this implicit bias is not only an ethical, but\nalso a technical issue, as it reveals an inability of LLMs to accommodate\nextraneous information. However, unlike other measures of LLM intelligence,\nthere are no standard methods to benchmark this specific subset of LLM bias. To\nbridge this gap, we developed a method for calculating an easily interpretable\nbenchmark, DIF (Demographic Implicit Fairness), by evaluating preexisting LLM\nlogic and math problem datasets with sociodemographic personas.

However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary\nenormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident\nto one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel\nmethod for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI),\nspecifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically\nobserved heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a\nmodel's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when\ntreated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human\nmedian in their individual commonsense competence.

While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and\ndecentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many\nscenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization\nimposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While\nmore robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for\nhomogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper\nintroduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the\nchallenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge,\ncharacterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and\nlack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and\nasynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet\ndecentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We\nintroduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically\ninfer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model\nupdates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's\nmodel aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized\ntraining while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous\ndecentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network\nsize, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource\nrequirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods\noutperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and\nheterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and\nreliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks."}

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

Additionally, we examined the\nalignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our\nfindings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear\nindistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations,\nhuman-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore,\nautomated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into\nquestion their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to\nsystematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and\ncomprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation\nframeworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods\nthat explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension."}

To better understand the\ninterplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary\nbiology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL,\nadapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and\nphenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to\nenvironmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability\ndictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic\nencoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We\nexperimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and\nsystematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in\nTransformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high\nenvironmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp\ntransition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL\nefficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics\nreveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift\noccurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we\ndemonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL\nacquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding\nto ICL dominance.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong\nsuperposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other,\nthe loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide\nrange of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is\nexplained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower\ndimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales\ninversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced\nLLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match\nthe predictions of our toy model.

However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work\nis often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of\ntransferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical\nexperts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm\nidentification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8\npractitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design\nchoices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by\nnon-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to\nsupport mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without\nscaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google\nDocs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint\nharm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to\nalign understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based\nprototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively\nfacilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the\nearly design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft\ndevelopment plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through\nstage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface\npotential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO\nincreased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline\nworksheets.

Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of\nbifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is\ncharacteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and\ndiverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early\nWarning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical\nsignatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong\npredictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a\nmachine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can\neffectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models'\ncapacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation\ntransitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase\ntransitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS\ndetection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models\ncan be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is\nencoded in spatiotemporal dynamics.

Rather than using a safety\ncertifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe\ncontroller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe\ncontrollers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this\napproach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a\nhigh-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic\ninterventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by\ndeciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly\nefficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing\nover a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To\nlearn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers\nare learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system\nis first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The\neffect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the\nclosed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such\nthat the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is\nminimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data\nrequirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to\nintegrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation\ntechnique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal\nimplementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by\nnoise.

In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called\nClassical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are\nconsidered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time\nstep. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking\ninto account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can\nbe safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of\nconflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the\nbody of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying\nstill at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how\nharder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while\nplanning.

In\nthis paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard\nand, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be\npresented.

Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs\nrepresent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e.,\nrepresentations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur\nwith varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss\nscaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only\nthe most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of\nloss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature\nfrequencies follow a power law, so does the loss.

Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered\nout-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a\nmodel's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be\nexcluded from the training set whenever possible.

However, the problem of repetitions during the\ngeneration process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on\ncontent repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition\nproblem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is\nstructural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in\nvarious patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently\nreflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition\nand propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for\nRepetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems\nin code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to\nidentify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically\ndecays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions,\nthereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we\nconstruct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches\nfor mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the\nbest-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and\nMBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of\ngenerated code."}

However, purely prompt-driven generation loses\nfine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic\nmetrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these\nissues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information\nembedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical\nfeatures are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic\nfiltering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features\nof images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and\ncritical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a\ndiffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual\ninformation fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the\ngenerated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,\nthe GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted\nfeatures and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we\ndesign a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume\nof features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental\nresults validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating\nwith both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized\nsystem achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of\nhigher PSNR and lower FID scores."}

Traditional annealing\nmethods require temperature schedules and hyperparameter tuning, falling short\nof the goal of truly black-box variational inference. We introduce FlowVAT, a\nconditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that\naddresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target\ndistributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By\nconditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized\nneural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow\nrepresenting the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes\nidentified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior\nat $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In\nexperiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT\noutperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and\nachieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing\napproaches fail.

A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of\nordinary differential equations.

This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation,\nand Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer\ninto RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two\nblock stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic\nmanipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to\nsolve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In\nthis work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid\nconstraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards\nconcurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two\nself-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to\nfacilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40\npercent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10\npercent compared to traditional RL methods.
