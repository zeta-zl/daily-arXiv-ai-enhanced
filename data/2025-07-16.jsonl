This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives.

Our custom models outperform fine-tuned\nvariants of well-known encoder-only transformer models, including BERT-base,\nRoBERTa, and ModernBERT, on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. We\ndemonstrate the use of our best-performing custom configuration on three tasks\nrelated to ASW data analysis: (i) decomposing the giant component in a graph\nrepresentation of ASW data, (ii) clustering ASW ad text, and (iii) using the\nlearned token embeddings to understand the use of emojis in the illicit context\nwe study.

This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies\nin solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda\nfocused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance\nfor the emerging WoA."}

To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning.

This paper introduces the Data Contamination Risk\n(DCR) framework, a lightweight, interpretable pipeline designed to detect and\nquantify BDC across four granular levels: semantic, informational, data, and\nlabel. By synthesizing contamination scores via a fuzzy inference system, DCR\nproduces a unified DCR Factor that adjusts raw accuracy to reflect\ncontamination-aware performance. Validated on 9 LLMs (0.5B-72B) across\nsentiment analysis, fake news detection, and arithmetic reasoning tasks, the\nDCR framework reliably diagnoses contamination severity and with accuracy\nadjusted using the DCR Factor to within 4% average error across the three\nbenchmarks compared to the uncontaminated baseline. Emphasizing computational\nefficiency and transparency, DCR provides a practical tool for integrating\ncontamination assessment into routine evaluations, fostering fairer comparisons\nand enhancing the credibility of LLM benchmarking practices."}

This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is\noften impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the\neffectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based\naugmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via\nspoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally\ncongruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned\nIP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'\nreappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,\nexternalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we\nconducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive\nemotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive\nimages from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without\nAI-generated visual feedback.

In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning\nattacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for\nDMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for\nvisualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify\nand experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across\ntimesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias\nand inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we\nobserve that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept\nregions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism\ncomprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency\npoison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid\nadversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain\nlearning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning\nmethods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all\npoisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published\ndefenses.

One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning\nthe dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often\nrelying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such\nas network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often\nclusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and\nmedical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data\nefficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a\nclass-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows\nremarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and\nrecall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best\nmethod, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and\n4.11% in recall.\n  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,\nimbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly\nmodeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and\ngeneralizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios."}

Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches.

Yet a disconnect\nremains between theory and practical implementation.\n  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to\nbridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into\nreal-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and\ncoordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge\nclassical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static\npayoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational\nrealities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel\nsolution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now\nbe modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.\n  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and\ncybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,\nBayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM\nagents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed\nreasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and\ncoordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,\nand adaptive cyber systems."}

In our opinion, this is the\nreason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper\nsemantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To\naddress this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code\ncomprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more\nrobust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of\nvarying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess\nsemantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In\nparticular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe\nthat model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks.\nThe most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy\nincreases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across\nother models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability.\nAmong the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest\nmicro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task."}

Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor\nspaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices\ndemonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and\n1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor\nlocalization frameworks."}

Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance."}

In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing\nthe effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but\ncan also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as\ntext-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research\nand applications in other domains."}

To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model.

Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often\nsuffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their\nability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,\na novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)\narchitecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)\ncomputational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the\nDirection-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive\nSqueeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan\nmechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional\nbias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational\nefficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature\nextraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic\nrelationship capture.

However, the impact of\nactivation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain\nremains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current\nliterature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific\nactivation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep\nlearning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,\nMDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset\nrecorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks\nwere trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent\ntraining parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions\nsuch as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly\nused functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the\narchitecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was\nconducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further\nsupporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance\ngains.

However, INR-based compression of large images faces\nchallenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),\na novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,\nrecognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we\naccelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,\nmixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a\nparallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image\nstorage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a\nnovel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while\nmaintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging\ndatasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior\nPSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while\naccelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times."}

The proposed\nmodel uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.\nUsing a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies\ndistinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through\npreliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey\ninvolving more than 1000 human subjects.
