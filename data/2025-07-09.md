### [1] [TokenShapley: Token Level Context Attribution with Shapley Value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05261)
*Yingtai Xiao,Yuqing Zhu,Sirat Samyoun,Wanrong Zhang,Jiachen T. Wang,Jian Du*

Key words: 大语言模型、上下文学习、归因方法、令牌级归因、Shapley值、KNN检索技术

TL;DR: 提出TokenShapley方法，通过结合Shapley值和KNN检索技术，实现细粒度的令牌级归因，提升了11-23%的准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有句子级归因方法无法满足对响应中特定关键词（如数字、年份、名称）的归因需求。

Method: 结合Shapley值的数据归因和KNN检索技术，利用预计算的数据库进行上下文检索和令牌重要性量化。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，TokenShapley在令牌级归因上优于现有基线方法，准确性提升11-23%。

Conclusion: TokenShapley提供了一种有效的细粒度数据归因方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context
learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a
challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these
methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the
response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we
propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines
Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques
inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed
datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify
token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution
approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an
11-23% improvement in accuracy.

### [2] [User Behavior Prediction as a Generic, Robust, Scalable, and Low-Cost Evaluation Strategy for Estimating Generalization in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05266)
*Sougata Saha,Monojit Choudhury*

Key words: 大语言模型,泛化能力,用户行为预测,数据污染

TL;DR: 本文探讨了评估大语言模型（LLM）泛化能力的挑战，提出了用户行为预测作为替代任务，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 由于数据污染问题，传统任务难以准确评估LLM的泛化能力，因此需要一种新的评估方法。

Method: 提出用户行为预测作为评估框架，并在电影和音乐推荐数据集上测试了GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct。

Result: 实验结果显示GPT-4o表现最佳，但仍存在改进空间，尤其是Llama模型。

Conclusion: 用户行为预测是一种可行的替代方法，但现有模型仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Measuring the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
challenging due to data contamination. As models grow and computation becomes
cheaper, ensuring tasks and test cases are unseen during training phases will
become nearly impossible. We argue that knowledge-retrieval and reasoning tasks
are not ideal for measuring generalization, as LLMs are not trained for
specific tasks. Instead, we propose user behavior prediction, also a key aspect
of personalization, as a theoretically sound, scalable, and robust alternative.
We introduce a novel framework for this approach and test it on movie and music
recommendation datasets for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.
Results align with our framework's predictions, showing GPT-4o outperforms
GPT-4o-mini and Llama, though all models have much room for improvement,
especially Llama.

### [3] [An Adaptive Supervised Contrastive Learning Framework for Implicit Sexism Detection in Digital Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05271)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Aditya Shah,Nagendra Kumar*

Key words: 隐性性别歧视,对比学习,自适应监督,文本分类,社交媒体

TL;DR: ASCEND框架通过自适应监督对比学习提升隐性性别歧视检测效果，显著优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 社交媒体中隐性性别歧视内容难以检测，传统方法效果有限，需更精准的解决方案。

Method: 结合阈值对比学习，选择性处理样本对，联合优化对比损失与交叉熵损失，增强文本特征。

Result: 在EXIST2021和MLSC数据集上，平均Macro F1提升9.86%至32.51%。

Conclusion: ASCEND有效捕捉隐性性别歧视的细微线索，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: The global reach of social media has amplified the spread of hateful content,
including implicit sexism, which is often overlooked by conventional detection
methods. In this work, we introduce an Adaptive Supervised Contrastive lEarning
framework for implicit sexism detectioN (ASCEND). A key innovation of our
method is the incorporation of threshold-based contrastive learning: by
computing cosine similarities between embeddings, we selectively treat only
those sample pairs as positive if their similarity exceeds a learnable
threshold. This mechanism refines the embedding space by robustly pulling
together representations of semantically similar texts while pushing apart
dissimilar ones, thus reducing false positives and negatives. The final
classification is achieved by jointly optimizing a contrastive loss with a
cross-entropy loss. Textual features are enhanced through a word-level
attention module. Additionally, we employ sentiment, emotion, and toxicity
features. Evaluations on the EXIST2021 and MLSC datasets demonstrate that
ASCEND significantly outperforms existing methods, with average Macro F1
improvements of 9.86%, 29.63%, and 32.51% across multiple tasks, highlighting
its efficacy in capturing the subtle cues of implicit sexist language.

### [4] [Beyond classical and contemporary models: a transformative ai framework for student dropout prediction in distance learning using rag, prompt engineering, and cross-modal fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05285)
*Miloud Mihoubi,Meriem Zerkouk,Belkacem Chikhaoui*

Key words: 辍学预测、情感分析、RAG、多模态融合、教育AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种AI框架，通过情感分析、提示工程和多模态注意力融合，显著提升学生辍学预测的准确性和可操作性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决远程教育中辍学率高的问题，传统方法难以捕捉情感和上下文因素。

Method: 结合RAG增强的BERT模型、提示工程和多模态注意力融合技术。

Result: 在4423名学生的数据集上，准确率达89%，F1分数0.88，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅预测辍学风险，还提供可操作的干预措施。

Abstract: Student dropout in distance learning remains a critical challenge, with
profound societal and economic consequences. While classical machine learning
models leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often
fail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in
unstructured student interactions. This paper introduces a transformative AI
framework that redefines dropout prediction through three synergistic
innovations: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for domain-specific sentiment
analysis, prompt engineering to decode academic stressors, and cross-modal
attention fusion to dynamically align textual, behavioral, and
socio-demographic insights. By grounding sentiment analysis in a curated
knowledge base of pedagogical content, our RAG-enhanced BERT model interprets
student comments with unprecedented contextual relevance, while optimized
prompts isolate indicators of academic distress (e.g., "isolation," "workload
anxiety"). A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with
temporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk profiles. Evaluated on a
longitudinal dataset of 4 423 students, the framework achieves 89% accuracy and
an F1-score of 0.88, outperforming conventional models by 7% and reducing false
negatives by 21%. Beyond prediction, the system generates interpretable
interventions by retrieving contextually aligned strategies (e.g., mentorship
programs for isolated learners). This work bridges the gap between predictive
analytics and actionable pedagogy, offering a scalable solution to mitigate
dropout risks in global education systems

### [5] [LCDS: A Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary Generation System Supporting Source Attribution and Expert Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05319)
*Cheng Yuan,Xinkai Rui,Yongqi Fan,Yawei Fan,Boyang Zhong,Jiacheng Wang,Weiyan Zhang,Tong Ruan*

Key words: 大型语言模型, 出院摘要, 幻觉问题, LCDS系统, 电子病历, 源映射, 逻辑规则

TL;DR: 针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在自动生成出院摘要时的幻觉问题，论文提出LCDS系统，通过源映射表和逻辑规则生成可靠摘要，并支持内容溯源，以优化模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: LLMs在生成出院摘要时存在幻觉问题（如生成不准确内容或捏造信息），且难以溯源长表单电子病历（EMRs）中的信息。

Method: 提出LCDS系统，通过计算文本相似性构建源映射表，并引入逻辑规则生成可靠的银色出院摘要，支持内容溯源和专家反馈。

Result: LCDS能生成更可靠的摘要，支持专家高效审核和纠错，生成的“金色摘要”可用于LLMs的增量微调。

Conclusion: LCDS有效解决了LLMs在生成出院摘要时的幻觉和溯源问题，为医疗领域的自动化摘要提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
automated discharge summary generation, they still suffer from hallucination
issues, such as generating inaccurate content or fabricating information
without valid sources. In addition, electronic medical records (EMRs) typically
consist of long-form data, making it challenging for LLMs to attribute the
generated content to the sources. To address these challenges, we propose LCDS,
a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a
source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and
discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover,
LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate
more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.
Furthermore, LCDS supports source attribution for generated content, allowing
experts to efficiently review, provide feedback, and rectify errors. The
resulting golden discharge summaries are subsequently recorded for incremental
fine-tuning of LLMs. Our project and demo video are in the GitHub repository
https://github.com/ycycyc02/LCDS.

compatibility with alternative solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG).

### [8] [On the Bias of Next-Token Predictors Toward Systematically Inefficient Reasoning: A Shortest-Path Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05362)
*Riccardo Alberghi,Elizaveta Demyanenko,Luca Biggio,Luca Saglietti*

Key words: 自然语言处理, 大语言模型, 推理痕迹, 动态规划, 泛化能力

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过优化推理痕迹（reasoning traces）提升大语言模型的泛化能力，研究发现无效但连贯的推理痕迹相比高效痕迹更能提升模型表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索推理痕迹的结构和质量如何影响大语言模型的泛化能力，尤其是在计算资源分配和推理系统性方面。

Method: 研究方法包括在分层图的最短路径任务中训练解码器式Transformer模型，比较高效动态规划痕迹与无效回溯痕迹对模型的影响。

Result: 结果显示，在相同训练资源下，接受无效回溯痕迹训练的模型在未见图上表现更好，且这种优势与模型对下一词的预测置信度相关。

Conclusion: 结论指出，长且连贯的推理痕迹更易于优化训练信号，从而提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing highlight two key factors for
improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs): (i) allocating more
test-time compute tends to help on harder problems but often introduces
redundancy in the reasoning trace, and (ii) compute is most effective when
reasoning is systematic and incremental, forming structured chains of thought
(CoTs) akin to human problem-solving. To study these factors in isolation, we
introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs.
We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a
custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic
programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving
backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained
on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not
due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails
to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization
correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting
that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal
easier to optimize.

TL;DR: EduCoder 是一款专为教育对话设计的注释工具，支持复杂教学特征的标注，适用于教育研究。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有文本注释工具难以处理教育对话的复杂性，如多样的师生互动和教学特征的编码。

Method: 提供协作定义复杂代码书的平台，支持分类和开放注释，并提供上下文材料和多方标注比较功能。

Result: 开发了开源的 EduCoder 工具，支持教育对话的高效标注与数据可靠性提升。

Conclusion: EduCoder 填补了教育对话注释工具的空白，提升了研究效率和数据质量。

Abstract: We introduce EduCoder, a domain-specialized tool designed to support
utterance-level annotation of educational dialogue. While general-purpose text
annotation tools for NLP and qualitative research abound, few address the
complexities of coding education dialogue transcripts -- with diverse
teacher-student and peer interactions. Common challenges include defining
codebooks for complex pedagogical features, supporting both open-ended and
categorical coding, and contextualizing utterances with external features, such
as the lesson's purpose and the pedagogical value of the instruction. EduCoder
is designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for researchers
and domain experts to collaboratively define complex codebooks based on
observed data. It incorporates both categorical and open-ended annotation types
along with contextual materials. Additionally, it offers a side-by-side
comparison of multiple annotators' responses, allowing comparison and
calibration of annotations with others to improve data reliability. The system
is open-source, with a demo video available.

### [10] [The Generalization Ridge: Information Flow in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05387)
*Ruidi Chang,Chunyuan Deng,Hanjie Chen*

Key words: Transformer, 信息论, 泛化, 中间层, 预测信息

TL;DR: 本文提出InfoRidge框架，通过信息论分析Transformer模型中任务相关信息随深度的变化，发现预测信息在中上层达到峰值（形成“泛化岭”），并揭示了中间层在泛化中的关键作用。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在自然语言生成任务中表现优异，但其内部信息合成机制尚不明确，尤其是中间层如何支持泛化能力。

Method: 提出InfoRidge框架，通过估计隐藏表示与目标输出的互信息来追踪任务相关信息的流动，并引入残差缩放系数作为功能探针。

Result: 实验显示预测信息在中上层达到峰值，形成“泛化岭”，模型在分布偏移时倾向于依赖中间层。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer中间层在泛化中的重要性，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in natural language generation (NLG) tasks, yet their internal mechanisms for
synthesizing task-relevant information remain insufficiently understood. While
prior studies suggest that intermediate layers often yield more generalizable
representations than final layers, how this generalization ability emerges and
propagates across layers during training remains unclear. To address this gap,
we propose InfoRidge, an information-theoretic framework, to characterize how
predictive information-the mutual information between hidden representations
and target outputs-varies across depth. Estimating this quantity enables us to
trace the flow of task-relevant information throughout the model during
training. Our experiments across various models and datasets reveal a
consistent non-monotonic trend: predictive information peaks in upper-middle
layers-forming a generalization ridge-before declining in final layers,
reflecting a transition between generalization and memorization. To further
investigate this phenomenon, we introduce residual scaling
coefficients-trainable scalar parameters applied to each residual block-which
serve as functional probes for assessing the relative importance of individual
transformer layers. These coefficients reveal that, under distribution shift,
models downweight final layers and increasingly rely on ridge layers,
highlighting their role in generalization. Together, these findings offer new
insights into the internal mechanisms of transformers and underscore the
critical role of intermediate layers in supporting generalization.

### [11] [Controlling What You Share: Assessing Language Model Adherence to Privacy Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05391)
*Guillem Ramírez,Alexandra Birch,Ivan Titov*

Key words: 隐私保护,大语言模型,隐私配置文件,PEEP数据集

TL;DR: 论文探讨通过隐私配置文件（自然语言指令）控制数据隐私，结合本地模型重写查询以保护敏感信息，同时引入PEEP数据集支持研究，指出轻量级LLMs在此任务上的局限性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 为了解决用户在使用商业API时可能暴露敏感数据的问题，提出隐私配置文件的概念，以自然语言指令形式指导数据保护。

Method: 构建一个框架，本地模型根据隐私配置文件重写查询，屏蔽敏感信息后再发送至外部模型，同时引入多语言数据集PEEP支持研究。

Result: 实验表明轻量级LLMs能部分遵循隐私指令，但仍面临挑战，显示需进一步提升对用户隐私偏好的理解。

Conclusion: 隐私配置文件是平衡隐私与性能的有效方法，但现有LLMs仍需改进以更好地支持用户隐私控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but
this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this
paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy
profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should
not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these
instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the
user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with
performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual
dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with
synthetic privacy profiles. Our experiments with lightweight LLMs show they can
follow these instructions to some extent, but also face consistent challenges,
highlighting the need for models that better understand and comply with
user-defined privacy preferences.

TL;DR: 该研究通过GeoFact-X基准和BRIDGE训练方法提升了LLMs在低资源语言中的推理能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多语言推理任务中表现不足，尤其是低资源语言，可能导致误解或默认使用英语推理，影响准确性和信任度。

Method: 提出GeoFact-X基准，包含五种语言的推理痕迹标注；开发BRIDGE训练方法，结合语言一致性奖励进行微调和强化学习。

Result: BRIDGE显著提升了多语言推理的准确性和一致性，表明推理感知的强化学习对跨语言泛化至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究证明了通过推理痕迹标注和语言一致性奖励可以改进LLMs在多语言任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like
mathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning
capabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource
languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or
default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource
languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current
multilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models
actually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce
GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with
annotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,
Swahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that
guides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a
language-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.
Finally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to
assess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning
traces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.
Our results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning
fidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement
learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.

*Yufei Tao,Adam Hiatt,Rahul Seetharaman,Ameeta Agrawal*

Key words: 大语言模型, 上下文知识, 参数知识, 评估框架, 位置偏见

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CoPE评估框架，用于系统性测量大语言模型在不同语言中如何整合上下文知识和参数知识，揭示了模型存在的"lost-in-the-later"现象及其对上下文理解的影响。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何优先处理和整合上下文与参数知识，填补了该领域的空白。

Method: 使用MultiWikiAtomic数据集在三种语言中分析模型行为，提出CoPE评估框架。

Result: 发现模型存在位置偏见（"lost-in-the-later"），且推理模型和带CoT提示的模型对上下文利用更差。通过提示方法改进可以提高事实基础和减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 上下文知识的有效利用需要针对性设计提示方法，以缓解模型的位置偏见。

Abstract: Large language models are capable of leveraging both contextual and
parametric knowledge but how they prioritize and integrate these sources
remains underexplored. We introduce CoPE, a novel evaluation framework that
systematically measures contextual knowledge (CK) and parametric knowledge (PK)
across models and languages. Using our MultiWikiAtomic dataset in English,
Spanish, and Danish, we analyze how large language models (LLMs) integrate
context, prioritize information, and incorporate PK in open-ended question
answering. Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where
LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given
context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding.
We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted
with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models
without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting,
in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to
degraded contextual grounding. Based on these insights, we design prompt-based
methods to effectively leverage input context. A case study applying CoPE to
summarization demonstrates that CK-informed prompting improves factual
grounding and reduces hallucination.

TL;DR: 研究分析了美国最高法院2022年多布斯案裁决后，性别和地方政治背景如何影响公众对堕胎权的讨论，发现性别差异在保守地区尤为显著，且泄露草案加剧了网络参与。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨性别和地方政治背景如何交织影响公众对堕胎权的态度和情感表达，尤其是在政治极化背景下。

Method: 通过分析近1000万条X（原Twitter）用户发布的堕胎相关帖子，推断用户的性别、意识形态和地理位置。

Result: 性别显著调节堕胎态度和情感表达，尤其在保守地区；泄露草案进一步动员了支持堕胎的女性。

Conclusion: 堕胎讨论不仅是意识形态极化，还深受到性别和地理背景影响，身份认同在制度动荡期塑造政治表达中起核心作用。

Abstract: The U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health
Organization marked a turning point in the national debate over reproductive
rights. While the ideological divide over abortion is well documented, less is
known about how gender and local sociopolitical contexts interact to shape
public discourse. Drawing on nearly 10 million abortion-related posts on X
(formerly Twitter) from users with inferred gender, ideology and location, we
show that gender significantly moderates abortion attitudes and emotional
expression, particularly in conservative regions, and independently of
ideology. This creates a gender gap in abortion attitudes that grows more
pronounced in conservative regions. The leak of the Dobbs draft opinion further
intensified online engagement, disproportionately mobilizing pro-abortion women
in areas where access was under threat. These findings reveal that abortion
discourse is not only ideologically polarized but also deeply structured by

Abstract: Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)
learners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as
English and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate
vocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to
generate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's
first language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this
research has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,
rather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel
cross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence
based on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We
evaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,
comparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated
approaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term
recall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale
performs comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas
for future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否具备真正的语言理解能力，尤其是其语义层面的表现。

Method: 结合LLMs的内部机制分析和经典语义理论（Frege和Russell），从词句层面考察LLMs的语义能力。

Result: 研究揭示了LLMs在语义能力上的潜在表现，并提供了更细致的理解。

Conclusion: LLMs在语义能力上有一定潜力，但仍需进一步研究以明确其理解深度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT demonstrated the potential to
replicate human language abilities through technology, ranging from text
generation to engaging in conversations. However, it remains controversial to
what extent these systems truly understand language. We examine this issue by
narrowing the question down to the semantics of LLMs at the word and sentence
level. By examining the inner workings of LLMs and their generated
representation of language and by drawing on classical semantic theories by
Frege and Russell, we get a more nuanced picture of the potential semantic
capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Automatic toxic language detection is critical for creating safe, inclusive
online spaces. However, it is a highly subjective task, with perceptions of
toxic language shaped by community norms and lived experience. Existing
toxicity detection models are typically trained on annotations that collapse
diverse annotator perspectives into a single ground truth, erasing important
context-specific notions of toxicity such as reclaimed language. To address
this, we introduce MODELCITIZENS, a dataset of 6.8K social media posts and 40K
toxicity annotations across diverse identity groups. To capture the role of
conversational context on toxicity, typical of social media posts, we augment
MODELCITIZENS posts with LLM-generated conversational scenarios.
State-of-the-art toxicity detection tools (e.g. OpenAI Moderation API,
GPT-o4-mini) underperform on MODELCITIZENS, with further degradation on
context-augmented posts. Finally, we release LLAMACITIZEN-8B and
GEMMACITIZEN-12B, LLaMA- and Gemma-based models finetuned on MODELCITIZENS,
which outperform GPT-o4-mini by 5.5% on in-distribution evaluations. Our
findings highlight the importance of community-informed annotation and modeling
for inclusive content moderation.

Conclusion: LLMs在临床任务中表现优异，新数据集将推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and o1 have demonstrated strong
performance on clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks across multiple
medical benchmarks. Nonetheless, two high-impact NLP tasks - structured tabular
reporting from nurse dictations and medical order extraction from
doctor-patient consultations - remain underexplored due to data scarcity and
sensitivity, despite active industry efforts. Practical solutions to these
real-world clinical tasks can significantly reduce the documentation burden on
healthcare providers, allowing greater focus on patient care. In this paper, we
investigate these two challenging tasks using private and open-source clinical
datasets, evaluating the performance of both open- and closed-weight LLMs, and
analyzing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we propose
an agentic pipeline for generating realistic, non-sensitive nurse dictations,
enabling structured extraction of clinical observations. To support further
research in both areas, we release SYNUR and SIMORD, the first open-source
datasets for nurse observation extraction and medical order extraction.

Conclusion: R2-LLMs通过分层检索和过程奖励模型的有效结合，显著提升了语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
leveraging additional computational resources at inference time to enhance
model performance. In this work, we introduce R2-LLMs, a novel and versatile
hierarchical retrieval-augmented reasoning framework designed to improve
test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) without requiring
distillation from more advanced models to obtain chain-of-thought (CoT)
training data. R2-LLMs enhances inference-time generalization by integrating
dual-level retrieval-based in-context learning: (1) At the coarse level, our
approach extracts abstract templates from complex reasoning problems and
retrieves similar problem-answer pairs to facilitate high-level in-context
learning; (2) At the fine level, during Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), R2-LLMs
efficiently retrieves analogous intermediate solution steps from reference
mathematical problem datasets, refining step-wise reasoning with the aid of a
process reward model (PRM) for scoring. R2-LLMs is a robust hierarchical
reasoning-augmentation method that enhances in-context-level reasoning while
seamlessly integrating with step-level tree search methods. Utilizing PRM, it
refines both candidate generation and decision-making for improved reasoning
accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the MATH500, GSM8K, and OlympiadBench-TO
datasets achieve substantial relative improvement with an increase of up to 16%
using LLaMA-3.1-8B compared to the baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of
our approach in complex reasoning tasks.

Result: 实验显示，Re5在小规模数据下性能与GPT-4o-mini相当，修订后的响应质量提升64.24%。

Conclusion: Re5是一种高效且有效的解决方案，能以最小的外部监督提升指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)
adherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective
approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.
However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a
single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have
been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision
iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a
resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage
high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation
capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a
degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these
challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed
to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of
the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user
instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,
and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by
selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving
improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,
enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative
refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves
instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data
generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of
data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the
non-revised initial responses. These results validate Re5 as an efficient and
effective solution for enhancing instruction adherence with minimal external
supervision.

Result: 实验在金融和医疗基准测试及实际应用中验证了方法的有效性，模型已在线部署。

Conclusion: 翻转知识蒸馏能有效结合小模型的领域优势与LLM的语义能力，提升任务性能。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large
Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such
as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective
domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of
input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the
rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge
distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the
architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by
reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder
generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output
space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their
similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the
teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.
The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and
adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative
samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing
the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and
healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its
effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.

Method: 提出SARA框架，结合自然语言文本片段和语义压缩向量，通过精细粒度上下文和高效语义压缩优化RAG。

Result: 在9个数据集和5个开源LLM上，SARA在答案相关性、正确性和语义相似性上分别提升了17.71、13.72和15.53。

Conclusion: 结合文本和压缩表示对于高效且稳健的RAG至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge but faces key challenges: restricted effective context
length and redundancy in retrieved documents. Pure compression-based approaches
reduce input size but often discard fine-grained details essential for factual
accuracy. We propose SARA, a unified RAG framework that balances local
precision and global knowledge coverage under tight context budgets. SARA
combines natural-language text snippets with semantic compression vectors to
jointly enhance context efficiency and answer correctness. It represents
contexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans
that preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,
interpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative
evidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking
of contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families
(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance
(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),
demonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed
representations for robust, context-efficient RAG.

Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of
real-world deployments.
  In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first

the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the
extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns.
We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for

Result: 实验结果表明，HIRAG训练策略显著提升了模型在RGB、PopQA、MuSiQue、HotpotQA和PubmedQA等数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: HIRAG通过分层次思维指令调优有效解决了RAG系统的不足，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a fundamental paradigm for
addressing the challenges faced by large language models in handling real-time
information and domain-specific problems. Traditional RAG systems primarily
rely on the in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of the large language model
itself. Still, in-depth research on the specific capabilities needed by the RAG
generation model is lacking, leading to challenges with inconsistent document
quality and retrieval system imperfections. Even the limited studies that
fine-tune RAG generative models often \textit{lack a granular focus on RAG
task} or \textit{a deeper utilization of chain-of-thought processes}. To
address this, we propose that RAG models should possess three progressively
hierarchical abilities (1) Filtering: the ability to select relevant
information; (2) Combination: the ability to combine semantic information
across paragraphs; and (3) RAG-specific reasoning: the ability to further
process external knowledge using internal knowledge. Thus, we introduce our new
RAG instruction fine-tuning method, Hierarchical-Thought Instruction-Tuning
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HIRAG) incorporates a "think before answering"
strategy. This method enhances the model's open-book examination capability by
utilizing multi-level progressive chain-of-thought. Experiments show that the
HIRAG training strategy significantly improves the model's performance on
datasets such as RGB, PopQA, MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and PubmedQA.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有MoE方法（如Switch Transformer）每层路由器独立运行，缺乏层间专家协作。

Method: 采用跨层共享路由器的Omni-router Transformer，促进专家专业化和协作。

Result: 在10个ASR基准测试中，Omni-router Transformer表现优于密集和Switch Transformer模型，词错误率分别降低11.2%和8.2%。

Conclusion: 共享路由器提升了MoE模型的性能、专家协作和多样性数据鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling
to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the
Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis
reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly
correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the
cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater
specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call
this model \emph{Omni-router Transformer}. Extensive experiments on a
large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse,
out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is
able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and
Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%,
respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness
to diverse data.

link-traversal-based LLM knowledge exploration, (2) SPARQL-based structured LLM
knowledge querying, (3) comparative exploration of the strengths and weaknesses
of LLM knowledge. Massive-recursive LLM knowledge materialization is a
groundbreaking opportunity both for the research area of systematic analysis of
LLM knowledge, as well as for automated KB construction. The GPTKB demonstrator

Conclusion: 通过合成对话数据预训练可以有效增强LLMs的多轮对话能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in multi-turn
conversational tasks, yet their pre-training data predominantly consists of
continuous prose, creating a potential mismatch between required capabilities
and training paradigms. We introduce a novel approach to address this
discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We
present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into
an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our
pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training
dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that
exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can
enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory
and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during
pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding,
without compromising base performance. DocTalk is available at

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探索LVLMs在模态补全任务中的推理能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 基于基础形式本体论构建基准，对模态补全进行系统分类和测试。

Result: 某些LVLMs在特定类别中表现较差，尤其在日语提示下。

Conclusion: LVLMs的模态补全能力存在语言和文化差异，需进一步优化。

Abstract: One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有ASR系统对不同说话者群体（如性别、年龄、口音）存在偏见，如何准确衡量系统性能与偏见是未解决的问题。

Method: 比较文献中和提出的性能与偏见衡量方法，应用于荷兰语ASR系统，并使用多种偏见缓解策略。

Result: 发现仅依赖平均错误率不足以全面评估系统，需结合其他衡量标准。

Conclusion: 建议报告ASR性能与偏见时采用更全面的衡量方法，以更好地反映系统对多样化说话者群体的表现。

Abstract: There is increasingly more evidence that automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems are biased against different speakers and speaker groups, e.g., due to
gender, age, or accent. Research on bias in ASR has so far primarily focused on
detecting and quantifying bias, and developing mitigation approaches. Despite
this progress, the open question is how to measure the performance and bias of
a system. In this study, we compare different performance and bias measures,
from literature and proposed, to evaluate state-of-the-art end-to-end ASR
systems for Dutch. Our experiments use several bias mitigation strategies to
address bias against different speaker groups. The findings reveal that
averaged error rates, a standard in ASR research, alone is not sufficient and
should be supplemented by other measures. The paper ends with recommendations
for reporting ASR performance and bias to better represent a system's
performance for diverse speaker groups, and overall system bias.

Conclusion: 该框架为低成本调查开发开辟新方向，并深化对LLM复现人类行为的理解。数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.

Motivation: 知识编辑任务中，当前评估方法的不确定性和对编辑器性能的潜在偏袒尚未充分探索，同时编辑对模型整体能力的影响也未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过比较不同指标、评估方法及编辑批量大小对编辑器排名的影响，同时对字符串匹配评估方法进行人工评估。

Result: 研究表明，评估方法和指标的选择显著影响编辑器排名，而字符串匹配方法存在假阳性匹配的倾向。

Conclusion: 现有评估方法需要改进以提高客观性，字符串匹配方法的准确性需进一步验证。

Abstract: Model editing has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years.
For Knowledge Editing in particular, more challenging evaluation datasets have
recently been released. These datasets use different methodologies to score the
success of editors. Yet, it remains under-explored how robust these
methodologies are and whether they unfairly favor some editors. Moreover, the
disruptive impact of these editors on overall model capabilities remains a
constant blind spot.
  We address both of these problems and show that choosing different metrics
and evaluation methodologies as well as different edit batch sizes can lead to
a different ranking of knowledge editors. Crucially we demonstrate this effect
also on general language understanding tasks evaluated alongside the knowledge
editing tasks. Further we include a manual assessment of the string matching
based evaluation method for knowledge editing that is favored by recently
released datasets, revealing a tendency to produce false positive matches.

Conclusion: DAEDCMD有效解决了持续性多模态虚假信息检测中的关键挑战，为未来研究和实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Nowadays, misinformation articles, especially multimodal ones, are widely
spread on social media platforms and cause serious negative effects. To control
their propagation, Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD) becomes an active
topic in the community to automatically identify misinformation. Previous MMD
methods focus on supervising detectors by collecting offline data. However, in
real-world scenarios, new events always continually emerge, making MMD models
trained on offline data consistently outdated and ineffective. To address this
issue, training MMD models under online data streams is an alternative,
inducing an emerging task named continual MMD. Unfortunately, it is hindered by
two major challenges. First, training on new data consistently decreases the
detection performance on past data, named past knowledge forgetting. Second,
the social environment constantly evolves over time, affecting the
generalization on future data. To alleviate these challenges, we propose to
remember past knowledge by isolating interference between event-specific
parameters with a Dirichlet process-based mixture-of-expert structure, and
anticipate future environmental distributions by learning a continuous-time
dynamics model. Accordingly, we induce a new continual MMD method DAEDCMD.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAEDCMD can consistently and
significantly outperform the compared methods, including six MMD baselines and
three continual learning methods.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究Ghosting技术的标准化问题和性能比较，填补聊天系统中的研究空白。

Method: 使用四种公开对话数据集，实验了多种自动补全方法，并提出了基于熵的动态早停策略。

Result: n-gram和trie方法在已知前缀上效果好，神经模型在未知查询上更优；对话上下文显著提升效果。

Conclusion: Ghosting技术需结合对话上下文，不同方法在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: Ghosting, the ability to predict a user's intended text input for inline
query auto-completion, is an invaluable feature for modern search engines and
chat interfaces, greatly enhancing user experience. By suggesting completions
to incomplete queries (or prefixes), ghosting aids users with slow typing
speeds, disabilities, or limited language proficiency. Ghosting is a
challenging problem and has become more important with the ubiquitousness of
chat-based systems like ChatGPT, Copilot, etc. Despite the increasing
prominence of chat-based systems utilizing ghosting, this challenging problem
of Chat-Ghosting has received little attention from the NLP/ML research
community. There is a lack of standardized benchmarks and relative performance
analysis of deep learning and non-deep learning methods. We address this
through an open and thorough study of this problem using four publicly
available dialog datasets: two human-human (DailyDialog and DSTC7-Ubuntu) and
two human-bot (Open Assistant and ShareGPT). We experiment with various
existing query auto-completion methods (using tries), n-gram methods and deep
learning methods, with and without dialog context. We also propose a novel
entropy-based dynamic early stopping strategy. Our analysis finds that
statistical n-gram models and tries outperform deep learning based models in
terms of both model performance and inference efficiency for seen prefixes. For
unseen queries, neural models like T5 and Phi-2 lead to better results. Adding
conversational context leads to significant improvements in ghosting quality,
especially for Open-Assistant and ShareGPT. We make code and data publicly
available

Result: 开源模型性能接近闭源系统，Gemma表现最佳，Pearson相关系数为0.99。

Conclusion: OpenFActScore推动透明、可重复的评估，适用于开源社区。

Abstract: We introduce OpenFActScore, an open-source implementation of the FActScore
framework for evaluating the factuality of text generated by large language
models (LLMs). FActScore evaluates the factual accuracy of long-form text by
using Atomic Fact Generation (AFG) to extract individual factual claims and
Atomic Fact Validation (AFV) to verify each claim against a trusted knowledge
source. While the original FActScore relies on closed-source and commercial
models such as InstructGPT and ChatGPT, OpenFActScore enables the use of any
Hugging Face-compatible model for both AFG and AFV. We provide a detailed
technical overview of our implementation, highlighting design choices and
modifications made to support open models. We evaluate multiple open-source
LLMs on both AFG and AFV using the original FActScore benchmark, reporting
BERTScore-F1 for AFG and Error Rate relative to human annotations for AFV. Our
results show that open models can approximate the performance of closed-source
systems, with Gemma achieving the best overall performance, and our final setup
obtains a 0.99 Pearson correlation with the original FActScore experiments.
OpenFActScore promotes transparency, reproducibility, and cost-effective
evaluation, and is available at: https://github.com/lflage/OpenFActScore.

Conclusion: RabakBench为东南亚多语言环境提供了鲁棒的安全评估，并为低资源环境中的本地化安全数据集构建提供了可复现框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their safety classifiers often perform
poorly on low-resource languages due to limited training data and evaluation
benchmarks. This paper introduces RabakBench, a new multilingual safety
benchmark localized to Singapore's unique linguistic context, covering
Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. RabakBench is constructed through a
scalable three-stage pipeline: (i) Generate - adversarial example generation by
augmenting real Singlish web content with LLM-driven red teaming; (ii) Label -
semi-automated multi-label safety annotation using majority-voted LLM labelers
aligned with human judgments; and (iii) Translate - high-fidelity translation
preserving linguistic nuance and toxicity across languages. The final dataset
comprises over 5,000 safety-labeled examples across four languages and six
fine-grained safety categories with severity levels. Evaluations of 11 popular
open-source and closed-source guardrail classifiers reveal significant
performance degradation. RabakBench not only enables robust safety evaluation
in Southeast Asian multilingual settings but also offers a reproducible
framework for building localized safety datasets in low-resource environments.
The benchmark dataset, including the human-verified translations, and
evaluation code are publicly available.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了模型性能，并大幅减少了碳排放。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅降低了训练成本，还提升了模型性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: A common training approach for language models involves using a large-scale
language model to expand a human-provided dataset, which is subsequently used
for model training.This method significantly reduces training costs by
eliminating the need for extensive human data annotation. However, it still
faces challenges such as high carbon emissions during data augmentation and the
risk of data leakage when we use closed-source LLMs. To address these issues,
we propose a self-evolution method for language models. First, we introduce the
Multi-level Principle Generation, which enables a large-scale model to
summarize task-completion principles based on a small amount of task data.
Then, we propose the Principle-based Instance Generation, in which a
smaller-scale language model uses these task principles to generate a large
amount of data. This data is then used for model training. Experimental results
show that our proposed method significantly improves model performance compared
to directly using a smaller-scale language model to generate data.
Additionally, since we only use the large-scale language model to generate the
task-completion principles, the carbon emissions associated with training the
model are greatly reduced.

Result: 生成了包含5k个维基百科摘要、约59k个实体和30k个关系三元组的合成数据集，并在DocIE共享任务中评估了性能。

Conclusion: 即使使用最先进的大语言模型，文档级上下文学习中的联合实体和关系抽取仍然具有挑战性。

Abstract: Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity
and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we
present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and
in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In
contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations
or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation
with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language
model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without
manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference
time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$
Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation
triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE
shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a
zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction
at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large
language models.

that employs zero-shot chain prompting. The framework is structured into four
error-handling stages, with three operating during task execution and one
functioning as a post-execution reflection phase. Our approach utilises the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to analyse execution challenges within their
environmental context and devise strategic solutions. We evaluate our method on
the TfD benchmark of the TEACH dataset and achieve state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming a baseline without error recovery by 11.5% and
surpassing the strongest existing model by 19%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨LLMs中训练数据的记忆难度，尤其是在看似随机的数据中的记忆特性。

Method: 通过在OLMo系列开源模型上的实验，提出了熵-记忆定律，并进一步研究了如何区分训练和测试数据。

Result: 发现数据熵与记忆分数线性相关，并观察到高随机性字符串的熵低于预期。

Conclusion: 熵-记忆定律有助于理解数据记忆难度，并可应用于数据集推断（DI）。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training
data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In
this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the
domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training
data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models,
we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is
linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of
memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such
sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low
empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same
strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective
approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference
(DI).

Motivation: 解决当前文本到图像生成技术以英语为中心的问题，避免翻译管道引入的语义漂移和计算开销。

Method: 结合大规模多语言预训练和高分辨率指令调优，训练NeoBabel模型。

Result: 在m-GenEval上得分为0.75，在m-DPG上得分为0.68，超越其他多语言模型。

Conclusion: 多语言能力不仅不会带来性能损失，反而是提高生成AI稳健性、效率和文化保真度的催化剂。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly
English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating
digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these
introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We
introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a
new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six
languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is
trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and
high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two
English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG.
NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining
strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG.
Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while
outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though
these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the
effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending
crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously
assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably,
NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We
release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated
dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual
evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates
that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved
robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.

Conclusion: Code Triangle框架揭示了LLMs编程认知的一致性及不一致性，为开发更强大编码模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code
generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We
introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs
across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation,
and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive
programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent
system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and
robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift
between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to
cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study
demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and
diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially
enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal
both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may
facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential
direction for developing more powerful coding models.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork-R1V3, an advanced, open-source vision-language model
(VLM) that pioneers a new approach to visual reasoning. Its key innovation lies
in effectively transferring reasoning skills from text-only Large Language
Models (LLMs) to visual tasks. The strong performance of Skywork-R1V3 primarily
stems from our elaborate post-training RL framework, which effectively
activates and enhances the model's reasoning ability, without the need for
additional continue pre-training. Through this framework, we further uncover
the fundamental role of the connector module in achieving robust cross-modal
alignment for multimodal reasoning models. In addition, we introduce a unique
indicator of reasoning capability, the entropy of critical reasoning tokens,
which has proven highly effective for checkpoint selection during RL training.
Skywork-R1V3 achieves state-of-the-art results on MMMU, significantly improving
from 64.3% to 76.0%. This performance matches entry-level human capabilities.
Remarkably, our RL-powered post-training approach enables even the 38B
parameter model to rival top closed-source VLMs. The implementation
successfully transfers mathematical reasoning to other subject-related
reasoning tasks. We also include an analysis of curriculum learning and
reinforcement finetuning strategies, along with a broader discussion on
multimodal reasoning. Skywork-R1V3 represents a significant leap in multimodal
reasoning, showcasing RL as a powerful engine for advancing open-source VLM

Conclusion: 优化评价阶段对生成可靠正式代码至关重要，CriticLean为形式数学推理提供新见解。

Abstract: Translating natural language mathematical statements into formal, executable
code is a fundamental challenge in automated theorem proving. While prior work
has focused on generation and compilation success, little attention has been
paid to the critic phase-the evaluation of whether generated formalizations
truly capture the semantic intent of the original problem. In this paper, we
introduce CriticLean, a novel critic-guided reinforcement learning framework
that elevates the role of the critic from a passive validator to an active
learning component. Specifically, first, we propose the CriticLeanGPT, trained
via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, to rigorously assess the
semantic fidelity of Lean 4 formalizations. Then, we introduce CriticLeanBench,
a benchmark designed to measure models' ability to distinguish semantically
correct from incorrect formalizations, and demonstrate that our trained
CriticLeanGPT models can significantly outperform strong open- and
closed-source baselines. Building on the CriticLean framework, we construct
FineLeanCorpus, a dataset comprising over 285K problems that exhibits rich
domain diversity, broad difficulty coverage, and high correctness based on
human evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight that optimizing the critic
phase is essential for producing reliable formalizations, and we hope our
CriticLean will provide valuable insights for future advances in formal
mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to Task 1, Subjectivity Detection, of the
CheckThat! Lab at CLEF 2025. We investigate the effectiveness of
transfer-learning and stylistic data augmentation to improve classification of
subjective and objective sentences in English news text. Our approach contrasts
fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders and transfer-learning of fine-tuned
transformer on related tasks. We also introduce a controlled augmentation
pipeline using GPT-4o to generate paraphrases in predefined subjectivity
styles. To ensure label and style consistency, we employ the same model to
correct and refine the generated samples. Results show that transfer-learning
of specified encoders outperforms fine-tuning general-purpose ones, and that
carefully curated augmentation significantly enhances model robustness,
especially in detecting subjective content. Our official submission placed us
$16^{th}$ of 24 participants. Overall, our findings underscore the value of
combining encoder specialization with label-consistent augmentation for
improved subjectivity detection. Our code is available at

Result: R2L标记化和长上下文窗口均未显著提升性能，最佳系统取得0.57的F1分数，位列CheckThat! 2025任务3前四。

Conclusion: 证据质量是影响数值声明核查性能的关键因素，现有技术需进一步优化。

Abstract: Numerical claims, statements involving quantities, comparisons, and temporal
references, pose unique challenges for automated fact-checking systems. In this
study, we evaluate modeling strategies for veracity prediction of such claims
using the QuanTemp dataset and building our own evidence retrieval pipeline. We
investigate three key factors: (1) the impact of more evidences with longer
input context windows using ModernBERT, (2) the effect of right-to-left (R2L)
tokenization, and (3) their combined influence on classification performance.
Contrary to prior findings in arithmetic reasoning tasks, R2L tokenization does
not boost natural language inference (NLI) of numerical tasks. A longer context
window does also not enhance veracity performance either, highlighting evidence
quality as the dominant bottleneck. Our best-performing system achieves
competitive macro-average F1 score of 0.57 and places us among the Top-4

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, especially when guided by explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning that verbalizes intermediate steps. While CoT improves both
interpretability and accuracy, its dependence on natural language reasoning
limits the model's expressive bandwidth. Latent reasoning tackles this
bottleneck by performing multi-step inference entirely in the model's
continuous hidden state, eliminating token-level supervision. To advance latent
reasoning research, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
emerging field of latent reasoning. We begin by examining the foundational role
of neural network layers as the computational substrate for reasoning,
highlighting how hierarchical representations support complex transformations.
Next, we explore diverse latent reasoning methodologies, including
activation-based recurrence, hidden state propagation, and fine-tuning
strategies that compress or internalize explicit reasoning traces. Finally, we
discuss advanced paradigms such as infinite-depth latent reasoning via masked
diffusion models, which enable globally consistent and reversible reasoning
processes. By unifying these perspectives, we aim to clarify the conceptual
landscape of latent reasoning and chart future directions for research at the
frontier of LLM cognition. An associated GitHub repository collecting the

Result: 实验验证了新指标的有效性，为研究社区提供了对效率与效果权衡的更清晰理解。

Conclusion: E²R-FLOPs 解决了现有指标的局限性，为LLM重新排序任务的效率评估提供了更可靠的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in
information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high
computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies
evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as
latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens.
However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg
parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size,
making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the
efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose
E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per
PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for
hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable
FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even
without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct
comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with
different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and
bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.

Conclusion: Agent KB为代理提供了模块化、框架无关的基础设施，支持从历史经验中学习并推广成功策略。

Abstract: As language agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, they struggle with
effective error correction and experience reuse across domains. We introduce
Agent KB, a hierarchical experience framework that enables complex agentic
problem solving via a novel Reason-Retrieve-Refine pipeline. Agent KB addresses
a core limitation: agents traditionally cannot learn from each other's
experiences. By capturing both high-level strategies and detailed execution
logs, Agent KB creates a shared knowledge base that enables cross-agent
knowledge transfer. Evaluated on the GAIA benchmark, Agent KB improves success
rates by up to 16.28 percentage points. On the most challenging tasks, Claude-3
improves from 38.46% to 57.69%, while GPT-4 improves from 53.49% to 73.26% on
intermediate tasks. On SWE-bench code repair, Agent KB enables Claude-3 to
improve from 41.33% to 53.33%. Our results suggest that Agent KB provides a
modular, framework-agnostic infrastructure for enabling agents to learn from
past experiences and generalize successful strategies to new tasks.

Conclusion: 论文建立了GNN过度平滑与安德森局域化的理论联系，为优化GNN性能提供了新视角。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in graph data
analysis due to their powerful representation capabilities. However, as the
network depth increases, the issue of over-smoothing becomes more severe,
causing node representations to lose their distinctiveness. This paper analyzes
the mechanism of over-smoothing through the analogy to Anderson localization
and introduces participation degree as a metric to quantify this phenomenon.
Specifically, as the depth of the GNN increases, node features homogenize after
multiple layers of message passing, leading to a loss of distinctiveness,
similar to the behavior of vibration modes in disordered systems. In this
context, over-smoothing in GNNs can be understood as the expansion of
low-frequency modes (increased participation degree) and the localization of
high-frequency modes (decreased participation degree). Based on this, we
systematically reviewed the potential connection between the Anderson
localization behavior in disordered systems and the over-smoothing behavior in
Graph Neural Networks. A theoretical analysis was conducted, and we proposed
the potential of alleviating over-smoothing by reducing the disorder in
information propagation.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现出最佳性能，优于11个基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个鲁棒且有效的外生输入利用方式，显著提升了时间序列预测效果。

Abstract: Although most transformer-based time series forecasting models primarily
depend on endogenous inputs, recent state-of-the-art approaches have
significantly improved performance by incorporating external information
through exogenous inputs. However, these methods face challenges, such as
redundancy when endogenous and exogenous inputs originate from the same source
and limited ability to capture long-term dependencies due to fixed look-back
windows. In this paper, we propose a method that whitens the exogenous input to
reduce redundancy that may persist within the data based on global statistics.
Additionally, our approach helps the exogenous input to be more aware of
patterns and trends over extended periods. By introducing this refined,
globally context-aware exogenous input to the endogenous input without
increasing the lookback window length, our approach guides the model towards
improved forecasting. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
four benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming 11 baseline models. These
results establish our method as a robust and effective alternative for using
exogenous inputs in time series forecasting.

Motivation: 为了解决DNN高计算成本和内存占用问题，同时利用XAI方法来理解DNN内部机制，从而提高压缩效率和模型性能。

Method: 采用梯度基础的XAI技术（LRP）计算权重重要性分数，剪除负或零分数参数，并对高分/低分权重分别进行高/低比特数量化。

Result: 模型尺寸减少64%，准确性比现有XAI压缩方法提高42%。

Conclusion: 提出的XAI压缩方法高效且对模型性能影响小，适合资源受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many
tasks but it often comes at a high computational cost and memory usage.
Compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, are applied to reduce
the memory footprint of DNNs and make it possible to accommodate them on
resource-constrained edge devices. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods have been introduced with the purpose of
understanding and explaining AI methods. XAI can be utilized to get to know the
inner functioning of DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and
features in the overall performance of DNNs. In this paper, a novel DNN
compression approach using XAI is proposed to efficiently reduce the DNN model
size with negligible accuracy loss. In the proposed approach, the importance
score of DNN parameters (i.e. weights) are computed using a gradient-based XAI
technique called Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Then, the scores are
used to compress the DNN as follows: 1) the parameters with the negative or
zero importance scores are pruned and removed from the model, 2)
mixed-precision quantization is applied to quantize the weights with
higher/lower score with higher/lower number of bits. The experimental results
show that, the proposed compression approach reduces the model size by 64%
while the accuracy is improved by 42% compared to the state-of-the-art
XAI-based compression method.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在断裂分析或局部疲劳准则中，准确预测局部应力场至关重要。传统有限元模拟在非线性超弹性情况下计算成本高，需要高效替代方案。

Method: 将周期性微观结构表示为图，使用消息传递图神经网络，训练中加入物理约束以保证应力场平衡状态，并采用周期性图表示强制周期性边界条件。

Result: 在非线性超弹性情况下，该方法相比有限元模拟显著提升计算速度，适用于大规模应用。

Conclusion: P-DivGNN 结合物理约束的图神经网络能够高效且准确地预测局部应力场，对多尺度模拟具有重要价值。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine learning framework called P-DivGNN to
reconstruct local stress fields at the micro-scale, in the context of
multi-scale simulation given a periodic micro-structure mesh and mean,
macro-scale, stress values. This method is based in representing a periodic
micro-structure as a graph, combined with a message passing graph neural
network. We are able to retrieve local stress field distributions, providing
average stress values produced by a mean field reduced order model (ROM) or
Finite Element (FE) simulation at the macro-scale. The prediction of local
stress fields are of utmost importance considering fracture analysis or the
definition of local fatigue criteria. Our model incorporates physical
constraints during training to constraint local stress field equilibrium state
and employs a periodic graph representation to enforce periodic boundary
conditions. The benefits of the proposed physics-informed GNN are evaluated
considering linear and non linear hyperelastic responses applied to varying
geometries. In the non-linear hyperelastic case, the proposed method achieves
significant computational speed-ups compared to FE simulation, making it
particularly attractive for large-scale applications.

Motivation: 传统的超参数调优（如学习率衰减和停止标准）依赖于验证损失，这可能效率低下且需要额外数据集。

Method: 提出NeVe方法，利用神经速度（神经元传递函数变化率）动态调整学习率和定义停止标准，仅需通过网络前向传播噪声即可计算神经速度。

Conclusion: 神经速度是一种有效且高效的指标，可替代传统验证损失用于超参数调优。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate decay and defining a stopping
criterion, often relies on monitoring the validation loss. This paper presents
NeVe, a dynamic training approach that adjusts the learning rate and defines
the stop criterion based on the novel notion of "neural velocity". The neural
velocity measures the rate of change of each neuron's transfer function and is
an indicator of model convergence: sampling neural velocity can be performed
even by forwarding noise in the network, reducing the need for a held-out
dataset. Our findings show the potential of neural velocity as a key metric for
optimizing neural network training efficiently

Abstract: Soft tissue simulation in virtual environments is becoming increasingly
important for medical applications. However, the high deformability of soft
tissue poses significant challenges. Existing methods rely on segmentation,
meshing and estimation of stiffness properties of tissues. In addition, the
integration of haptic feedback requires precise force estimation to enable a
more immersive experience. We introduce a novel data-driven model, a
conditional graph neural network (cGNN) to tackle this complexity. Our model
takes surface points and the location of applied forces, and is specifically
designed to predict the deformation of the points and the forces exerted on
them. We trained our model on experimentally collected surface tracking data of
a soft tissue phantom and used transfer learning to overcome the data scarcity
by initially training it with mass-spring simulations and fine-tuning it with
the experimental data. This approach improves the generalisation capability of
the model and enables accurate predictions of tissue deformations and
corresponding interaction forces. The results demonstrate that the model can
predict deformations with a distance error of 0.35$\pm$0.03 mm for deformations
up to 30 mm and the force with an absolute error of 0.37$\pm$0.05 N for forces
up to 7.5 N. Our data-driven approach presents a promising solution to the
intricate challenge of simulating soft tissues within virtual environments.
Beyond its applicability in medical simulations, this approach holds the
potential to benefit various fields where realistic soft tissue simulations are
required.

Abstract: Dataless neural networks represent a paradigm shift in applying neural
architectures to combinatorial optimization problems, eliminating the need for
training datasets by encoding problem instances directly into network
parameters. Despite the pioneering work of Alkhouri et al. (2022) demonstrating
the viability of dataless approaches for the Maximum Independent Set problem,
our comprehensive literature review reveals that no published work has extended
these methods to the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP).
This paper addresses this gap by presenting the first dataless neural network
approach for RCPSP, providing a complete mathematical framework that transforms
discrete scheduling constraints into differentiable objectives suitable for
gradient-based optimization. Our approach leverages smooth relaxations and
automatic differentiation to unlock GPU parallelization for project scheduling,
traditionally a domain of sequential algorithms. We detail the mathematical
formulation for both precedence and renewable resource constraints, including a
memory-efficient dense time-grid representation. Implementation and
comprehensive experiments on PSPLIB benchmark instances (J30, J60, and J120)
are currently underway, with empirical results to be reported in an updated
version of this paper.

Conclusion: HEPO提供了一种高效利用启发式奖励的方法，显著降低了对人工设计奖励的依赖，展示了其在强化学习中的实用价值。

Abstract: In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, augmenting the task rewards
with heuristic rewards that encode human priors about how a task should be
solved is crucial for achieving desirable performance. However, because such
heuristics are usually not optimal, much human effort and computational
resources are wasted in carefully balancing tasks and heuristic rewards.
Theoretically rigorous ways of incorporating heuristics rely on the idea of
\textit{policy invariance}, which guarantees that the performance of a policy
obtained by maximizing heuristic rewards is the same as the optimal policy with
respect to the task reward. However, in practice, policy invariance doesn't
result in policy improvement, and such methods are known to empirically perform
poorly. We propose a new paradigm to mitigate reward hacking and effectively
use heuristics based on the practical goal of maximizing policy improvement
instead of policy improvement. Our framework, Heuristic Enhanced Policy
Optimization (HEPO), effectively leverages heuristics while avoiding the
pitfall of prior methods for mitigating reward hacking. HEPO achieves superior
performance on standard benchmarks with well-engineered reward functions. More
surprisingly, HEPO allows policy optimization to achieve good performance even
when heuristics are not well-engineered and designed by non-expert humans,
showcasing HEPO's ability to reduce human effort in reward design. % HEPO is a
plug-and-play optimization method for leveraging heuristics in reinforcement
learning. Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo.

Conclusion: 模型展示了基础模型的关键能力（如少样本泛化和高效适应），并强调了在结构化数据表示学习中编码因果结构的重要性。

Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.

Method: 在七个多模态任务上进行实验，使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct作为基础模型，分析SFT和RFT的表现。

Result: RFT比SFT更能保留先前知识并提升通用能力，其隐式正则化是关键因素。提出了一种实例过滤算法优化RFT。

Conclusion: RFT是持续后训练中的更优范式。

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for
adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific
and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily
concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter
regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two
core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge
retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising
seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base
model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant
findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to
catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT
inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to
multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the
model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro).
Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis
shows that explicit mechanisms, such as KL penalty and chain-of-thought
reasoning, are not the primary factors. Instead, we find that the implicit
regularization inherent to RFT is a key factor in mitigating forgetting.
Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to improve the
stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the
superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

over-approximation techniques from LiRPA-based approaches with a sampling-based
method to compute tight intermediate reachable sets. In detail, we show that
with negligible computational overhead, $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$ exploiting the
estimated reachable sets, significantly tightens the lower and upper linear
bounds of a neural network's output, reducing the computational cost of formal
verification tools while providing probabilistic guarantees on verification
soundness. Extensive experiments on standard formal verification benchmarks,
including the International Verification of Neural Networks Competition, show
that our $\texttt{PT-LiRPA}$-based verifier improves robustness certificates by
up to 3.31X and 2.26X compared to related work. Importantly, our probabilistic
approach results in a valuable solution for challenging competition entries
where state-of-the-art formal verification methods fail, allowing us to provide

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning robust discriminative representations of
causally-related latent variables. In addition to observational data, the
training dataset also includes interventional data obtained through targeted
interventions on some of these latent variables to learn representations robust
against the resulting interventional distribution shifts. Existing approaches
treat interventional data like observational data, even when the underlying
causal model is known, and ignore the independence relations that arise from
these interventions. Since these approaches do not fully exploit the causal
relational information resulting from interventions, they learn representations
that produce large disparities in predictive performance on observational and
interventional data, which worsens when the number of interventional training
samples is limited. In this paper, (1) we first identify a strong correlation
between this performance disparity and adherence of the representations to the
independence conditions induced by the interventional causal model. (2) For
linear models, we derive sufficient conditions on the proportion of
interventional data in the training dataset, for which enforcing interventional
independence between representations corresponding to the intervened node and
its non-descendants lowers the error on interventional data. Combining these
insights, (3) we propose RepLIn, a training algorithm to explicitly enforce
this statistical independence during interventions. We demonstrate the utility
of RepLIn on a synthetic dataset and on real image and text datasets on facial
attribute classification and toxicity detection, respectively. Our experiments
show that RepLIn is scalable with the number of nodes in the causal graph and
is suitable to improve the robust representations against interventional
distribution shifts of both continuous and discrete latent variables.

Motivation: 困境公司有强烈的动机操纵财务报告以隐藏其困境并获取巨额利益，而现有攻击方法因目标冲突难以实现。

Method: 引入最大违反多目标（MVMO）攻击，通过调整攻击者的搜索方向，显著提高攻击的成功率。

Result: 在约50%的案例中，公司可以虚增收益100-200%，同时将欺诈评分降低15%。

Conclusion: MVMO攻击方法在现实威胁模型中表现出高效性，适用于实际欺诈场景。

Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to
manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal
gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of
dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial
modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to
anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to
succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that
adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying
attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of
cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously
reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional
accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are
performed in practice.

Method: 开发了四种代理变体（DQN、PPO、QR-DQN、H-DQN），并在Gym-2048环境中进行比较。H-DQN结合了分布学习、竞争架构等技术。

Result: H-DQN表现最佳，最高得分达41.828K并达到4096方块，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 分布多步目标可显著提升稀疏奖励领域的性能，未来可通过模型规划和课程学习进一步优化。

Abstract: Delayed and sparse rewards present a fundamental obstacle for
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents, which struggle to assign credit for actions
whose benefits emerge many steps later. The sliding-tile game 2048 epitomizes
this challenge: although frequent small score changes yield immediate feedback,
they often mislead agents into locally optimal but globally suboptimal
strategies. In this work, we introduce a unified, distributional multi-step RL
framework designed to directly optimize long-horizon performance. Using the
open source Gym-2048 environment we develop and compare four agent variants:
standard DQN, PPO, QR-DQN (Quantile Regression DQN), and a novel Horizon-DQN
(H-DQN) that integrates distributional learning, dueling architectures, noisy
networks, prioritized replay, and more. Empirical evaluation reveals a clear
hierarchy in effectiveness: max episode scores improve from 3.988K (DQN) to
5.756K (PPO), 8.66K (QR-DQN), and 18.21K (H-DQN), with H-DQN reaching the 2048
tile. Upon scaling H-DQN it reaches a max score 41.828K and a 4096 tile. These
results demonstrate that distributional, multi-step targets substantially
enhance performance in sparse-reward domains, and they suggest promising
avenues for further gains through model-based planning and curriculum learning.

Result: 实验表明，这种探索策略显著提升了FB算法的样本复杂度。

Conclusion: FB表示应主动用于探索，以优化学习效果。

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning is necessary for extracting optimal policies
in absence of concrete rewards for fast adaptation to future problem settings.
Forward-backward representations (FB) have emerged as a promising method for
learning optimal policies in absence of rewards via a factorization of the
policy occupancy measure. However, up until now, FB and many similar zero-shot
reinforcement learning algorithms have been decoupled from the exploration
problem, generally relying on other exploration algorithms for data collection.
We argue that FB representations should fundamentally be used for exploration
in order to learn more efficiently. With this goal in mind, we design
exploration policies that arise naturally from the FB representation that
minimize the posterior variance of the FB representation, hence minimizing its
epistemic uncertainty. We empirically demonstrate that such principled
exploration strategies improve sample complexity of the FB algorithm
considerably in comparison to other exploration methods. Code is publicly
available at https://sites.google.com/view/fbee-url.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究如何在在线凸优化中实现低累积损失，尤其是针对任意基准序列的动态遗憾最小化。

Method: 将动态遗憾问题转化为函数空间中的静态遗憾问题，利用RKHS构造合适的函数空间。

Result: 在多种损失设置下（如线性损失、指数凹损失等），获得了最优的动态遗憾保证和新的自适应结果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅理论上有优势，且在实际中可计算，扩展了动态遗憾最小化的应用范围。

Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is
to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By
observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators
$u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to
competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame
dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By
carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal
$R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$
dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new
scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover,
unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear
losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to
recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in
exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where
$d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite
working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to
algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of
RKHSs.

Result: 在分子生成任务中，SDG显著优于标准的无训练引导方法。

Conclusion: SDG结合了随机最优控制的理论优势和无训练方法的高效性，为扩散模型提供了一种可靠的训练免费引导框架。

Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled
framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on
computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling.
In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides
diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples,
bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be
interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate
diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can
introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we
unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free
diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control
objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals
the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to
the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein
variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our
method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a
principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost
functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on
challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly
outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential
for broader applications.

Abstract: Data-driven science and computation have advanced immensely to construct
complex functional relationships using trainable parameters. However,
efficiently discovering interpretable and accurate closed-form expressions from
complex dataset remains a challenge. The article presents a novel approach
called Explainable Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Networks or Ex-HiDeNN that
uses an accurate, frugal, fast, separable, and scalable neural architecture
with symbolic regression to discover closed-form expressions from limited
observation. The article presents the two-step Ex-HiDeNN algorithm with a
separability checker embedded in it. The accuracy and efficiency of Ex-HiDeNN
are tested on several benchmark problems, including discerning a dynamical
system from data, and the outcomes are reported. Ex-HiDeNN generally shows
outstanding approximation capability in these benchmarks, producing orders of
magnitude smaller errors compared to reference data and traditional symbolic
regression. Later, Ex-HiDeNN is applied to three engineering applications: a)
discovering a closed-form fatigue equation, b) identification of hardness from
micro-indentation test data, and c) discovering the expression for the yield
surface with data. In every case, Ex-HiDeNN outperformed the reference methods
used in the literature. The proposed method is built upon the foundation and
published works of the authors on Hierarchical Deep Learning Neural Network
(HiDeNN) and Convolutional HiDeNN. The article also provides a clear idea about
the current limitations and future extensions of Ex-HiDeNN.

as a data-driven graph structure represented by a set of nodes (representing

Convolution plus LSTM Neural Network (GCLSTM) which has shown remarkable
success in modelling complex patterns. We describe the formulation, model
estimation, interpretability and examine the relative performance of our
proposed model. We also present an illustrative architecture of the models and
apply on real-world WiFi logs collected at the Toronto Metropolitan University
campus. The results of the experiments show that the integrated GCLSTM models
significantly outperform traditional pedestrian flow estimators like the Multi

Abstract: Distributed learning methods have gained substantial momentum in recent
years, with communication overhead often emerging as a critical bottleneck.
Gradient compression techniques alleviate communication costs but involve an
inherent trade-off between the empirical efficiency of biased compressors and
the theoretical guarantees of unbiased compressors. In this work, we introduce
a novel Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) compression scheme that leverages biased
compressors to construct statistically unbiased estimates. This approach
effectively bridges the gap between biased and unbiased methods, combining the
strengths of both. To showcase the versatility of our method, we apply it to
popular compressors, like Top-$k$ and bit-wise compressors, resulting in
enhanced variants. Furthermore, we derive an adaptive version of our approach
to further improve its performance. We validate our method empirically on
distributed deep learning tasks.

desired business metrics and demonstrates superior algorithmic flexibility in
handling complex business constraints. Comprehensive evaluations, including

Result: 实验表明，该方法在公开数据集上能够显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种通用的深度学习框架，能够有效处理多变量治疗策略的HTE估计问题，并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: As estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE) is increasingly adopted
across a wide range of scientific and industrial applications, the treatment
action space can naturally expand, from a binary treatment variable to a
structured treatment policy. This policy may include several policy factors
such as a continuous treatment intensity variable, or discrete treatment
assignments. From first principles, we derive the formulation for incorporating
multiple treatment policy variables into the functional forms of individual and
average treatment effects. Building on this, we develop a methodology to
directly rank subjects using aggregated HTE functions. In particular, we
construct a Neural-Augmented Naive Bayes layer within a deep learning framework
to incorporate an arbitrary number of factors that satisfies the Naive Bayes
assumption. The factored layer is then applied with continuous treatment
variables, treatment assignment, and direct ranking of aggregated treatment
effect functions. Together, these algorithms build towards a generic framework
for deep learning of heterogeneous treatment policies, and we show their power
to improve performance with public datasets.

Result: 实验表明，MACE-TNP优于传统贝叶斯基线方法。

Conclusion: 元学习为复杂贝叶斯因果推断提供了灵活且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many
questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a
particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are
known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the
absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from
the available observational data. However, observational data are often
compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single
structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural
uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior
distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms.
Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with
the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose
to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end
model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process
(MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged
interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the
need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP
outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a
flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal
inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the
future.

Motivation: 传统ERM方法会利用训练数据中的虚假相关（捷径），导致模型在少数样本上的泛化能力较差。现有方法存在调参困难、计算成本高且效果不佳的问题。

Method: 提出InterpoLL方法，通过插值多数类样本的表示，引入少数类样本的特征，削弱捷径影响。

Result: 实验表明，InterpoLL在多种自然语言理解任务上显著提升了少数样本的泛化能力，且不影响多数样本的准确性。

Conclusion: InterpoLL是一种通用的捷径缓解方法，适用于多种模型架构。

Abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) incentivizes models to exploit shortcuts,
i.e., spurious correlations between input attributes and labels that are
prevalent in the majority of the training data but unrelated to the task at
hand. This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such
correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are
model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to
improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose
InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of
majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with
shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models
to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples.
Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks
demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and
state-of-the-art shortcut mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on
majority examples. Notably, these gains persist across encoder,
encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures, demonstrating the method's
broad applicability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful machine learning
method for graph-structured data. A plethora of hardware accelerators has been
introduced to meet the performance demands of GNNs in real-world applications.
However, security challenges of hardware-based attacks have been generally
overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of GNN models to
hardware-based fault attack, wherein an attacker attempts to misclassify output
by modifying trained weight parameters through fault injection in a memory
device. Thus, we propose Gradual Bit-Flip Fault Attack (GBFA), a layer-aware
bit-flip fault attack, selecting a vulnerable bit in each selected weight
gradually to compromise the GNN's performance by flipping a minimal number of
bits. To achieve this, GBFA operates in two steps. First, a Markov model is
created to predict the execution sequence of layers based on features extracted
from memory access patterns, enabling the launch of the attack within a
specific layer. Subsequently, GBFA identifies vulnerable bits within the
selected weights using gradient ranking through an in-layer search. We evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed GBFA attack on various GNN models for node
classification tasks using the Cora and PubMed datasets. Our findings show that
GBFA significantly degrades prediction accuracy, and the variation in its
impact across different layers highlights the importance of adopting a
layer-aware attack strategy in GNNs. For example, GBFA degrades GraphSAGE's
prediction accuracy by 17% on the Cora dataset with only a single bit flip in
the last layer.

Abstract: Jumping connections enable Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to overcome
over-smoothing, while graph sparsification reduces computational demands by
selecting a sub-matrix of the graph adjacency matrix during neighborhood
aggregation. Learning GCNs with graph sparsification has shown empirical
success across various applications, but a theoretical understanding of the
generalization guarantees remains limited, with existing analyses ignoring
either graph sparsification or jumping connections. This paper presents the
first learning dynamics and generalization analysis of GCNs with jumping
connections using graph sparsification. Our analysis demonstrates that the
generalization accuracy of the learned model closely approximates the highest
achievable accuracy within a broad class of target functions dependent on the
proposed sparse effective adjacency matrix $A^*$. Thus, graph sparsification
maintains generalization performance when $A^*$ preserves the essential edges
that support meaningful message propagation. We reveal that jumping connections
lead to different sparsification requirements across layers. In a
two-hidden-layer GCN, the generalization is more affected by the sparsified
matrix deviations from $A^*$ of the first layer than the second layer. To the
best of our knowledge, this marks the first theoretical characterization of
jumping connections' role in sparsification requirements. We validate our
theoretical results on benchmark datasets in deep GCNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle with noisy edges. We propose
Latent Space Constrained Graph Neural Networks (LSC-GNN) to incorporate
external "clean" links and guide embeddings of a noisy target graph. We train
two encoders--one on the full graph (target plus external edges) and another on
a regularization graph excluding the target's potentially noisy links--then
penalize discrepancies between their latent representations. This constraint
steers the model away from overfitting spurious edges. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show LSC-GNN outperforms standard and noise-resilient GNNs in graphs
subjected to moderate noise. We extend LSC-GNN to heterogeneous graphs and
validate it on a small protein-metabolite network, where metabolite-protein
interactions reduce noise in protein co-occurrence data. Our results highlight
LSC-GNN's potential to boost predictive performance and interpretability in
settings with noisy relational structures.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to ergonomic risk
assessment in manual material handling, particularly for estimating carried
load from gait motion data collected from wearable sensors. However, existing
approaches often rely on direct mappings from loaded gait to hand load,
limiting generalization and predictive accuracy. In this study, we propose an
enhanced load estimation framework that incorporates auxiliary information,
including baseline gait patterns during unloaded walking and carrying style.
While baseline gait can be automatically captured by wearable sensors and is
thus readily available at inference time, carrying style typically requires
manual labeling and is often unavailable during deployment. Our model
integrates deep latent variable modeling with temporal convolutional networks
and bi-directional cross-attention to capture gait dynamics and fuse loaded and
unloaded gait patterns. Guided by domain knowledge, the model is designed to
estimate load magnitude conditioned on carrying style, while eliminating the
need for carrying style labels at inference time. Experiments using real-world
data collected from inertial measurement units attached to participants
demonstrate substantial accuracy gains from incorporating auxiliary information
and highlight the importance of explicit fusion mechanisms over naive feature
concatenation.

Result: 实验表明，多任务预演能更好地预测人类在未完成任务中的泛化能力，并显著提升智能体在新任务中的性能。

Conclusion: Multitask Preplay是一种可扩展的理论，可用于解释人类和智能体在多任务环境中的学习和泛化能力。

Abstract: Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
"preplay" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training
data. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy
risks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these
concerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape
of memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and
mitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,
training dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.
In addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,
membership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness
in detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we
also explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and
ethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data
cleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while
highlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful
memorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
current state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and
performance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.

Abstract: Optical computing holds promise for high-speed, energy-efficient information
processing, with diffractive optical networks emerging as a flexible platform
for implementing task-specific transformations. A challenge, however, is the
effective optimization and alignment of the diffractive layers, which is
hindered by the difficulty of accurately modeling physical systems with their
inherent hardware imperfections, noise, and misalignments. While existing in
situ optimization methods offer the advantage of direct training on the
physical system without explicit system modeling, they are often limited by
slow convergence and unstable performance due to inefficient use of limited
measurement data. Here, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning
approach utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for the in situ training
of diffractive optical processors. PPO efficiently reuses in situ measurement
data and constrains policy updates to ensure more stable and faster
convergence. We experimentally validated our method across a range of in situ
learning tasks, including targeted energy focusing through a random diffuser,
holographic image generation, aberration correction, and optical image
classification, demonstrating in each task better convergence and performance.
Our strategy operates directly on the physical system and naturally accounts
for unknown real-world imperfections, eliminating the need for prior system
knowledge or modeling. By enabling faster and more accurate training under
realistic experimental constraints, this in situ reinforcement learning
approach could offer a scalable framework for various optical and physical
systems governed by complex, feedback-driven dynamics.

Abstract: In this work we propose a unified Fourier Spectral Transformer network that
integrates the strengths of classical spectral methods and attention based
neural architectures. By transforming the original PDEs into spectral ordinary
differential equations, we use high precision numerical solvers to generate
training data and use a Transformer network to model the evolution of the
spectral coefficients. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the
two dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the one dimensional
Burgers' equation. The results show that our spectral Transformer can achieve
highly accurate long term predictions even with limited training data, better
than traditional numerical methods and machine learning methods in forecasting
future flow dynamics. The proposed framework generalizes well to unseen data,
bringing a promising paradigm for real time prediction and control of complex
dynamical systems.

Abstract: Reward hacking in Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems poses a critical threat
to the deployment of autonomous agents, where agents exploit flaws in reward
functions to achieve high scores without fulfilling intended objectives.
Despite growing awareness of this problem, systematic detection and mitigation
approaches remain limited. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study of
reward hacking across diverse RL environments and algorithms. We analyze 15,247
training episodes across 15 RL environments (Atari, MuJoCo, custom domains) and
5 algorithms (PPO, SAC, DQN, A3C, Rainbow), implementing automated detection
algorithms for six categories of reward hacking: specification gaming, reward
tampering, proxy optimization, objective misalignment, exploitation patterns,
and wireheading. Our detection framework achieves 78.4% precision and 81.7%
recall across environments, with computational overhead under 5%. Through
controlled experiments varying reward function properties, we demonstrate that
reward density and alignment with true objectives significantly impact hacking
frequency ($p < 0.001$, Cohen's $d = 1.24$). We validate our approach through
three simulated application studies representing recommendation systems,
competitive gaming, and robotic control scenarios. Our mitigation techniques
reduce hacking frequency by up to 54.6% in controlled scenarios, though we find
these trade-offs are more challenging in practice due to concept drift, false
positive costs, and adversarial adaptation. All detection algorithms, datasets,
and experimental protocols are publicly available to support reproducible
research in RL safety.

Abstract: Graph learning has rapidly evolved into a critical subfield of machine
learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Its development began with early
graph-theoretic methods, gaining significant momentum with the advent of graph
neural networks (GNNs). Over the past decade, progress in scalable
architectures, dynamic graph modeling, multimodal learning, generative AI,
explainable AI (XAI), and responsible AI has broadened the applicability of
graph learning to various challenging environments. Graph learning is
significant due to its ability to model complex, non-Euclidean relationships
that traditional machine learning struggles to capture, thus better supporting
real-world applications ranging from drug discovery and fraud detection to
recommender systems and scientific reasoning. However, challenges like
scalability, generalization, heterogeneity, interpretability, and
trustworthiness must be addressed to unlock its full potential. This survey
provides a comprehensive introduction to graph learning, focusing on key
dimensions including scalable, temporal, multimodal, generative, explainable,
and responsible graph learning. We review state-of-the-art techniques for
efficiently handling large-scale graphs, capturing dynamic temporal
dependencies, integrating heterogeneous data modalities, generating novel graph
samples, and enhancing interpretability to foster trust and transparency. We
also explore ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, to ensure
responsible deployment of graph learning models. Additionally, we identify and
discuss emerging topics, highlighting recent integration of graph learning and
other AI paradigms and offering insights into future directions. This survey
serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to

Result: FACT-RFM在表格数据上表现优异，并能捕捉神经网络训练中的特征学习行为。

Conclusion: FACT理论为神经网络的特征学习提供了新的理论框架，FACT-RFM算法展示了其应用潜力。

Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural
networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at
Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural
network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay.
For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top
W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward
propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We
validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy
the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature
Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at
a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on
tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in
neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase
transitions in learning sparse parities.

Abstract: Canine gait analysis using wearable inertial sensors is gaining attention in
veterinary clinical settings, as it provides valuable insights into a range of
mobility impairments. Neurological and orthopedic conditions cannot always be
easily distinguished even by experienced clinicians. The current study explored
and developed a deep learning approach using inertial sensor readings to assess
whether neurological and orthopedic gait could facilitate gait analysis. Our
investigation focused on optimizing both performance and generalizability in
distinguishing between these gait abnormalities. Variations in sensor
configurations, assessment protocols, and enhancements to deep learning model
architectures were further suggested. Using a dataset of 29 dogs, our proposed
approach achieved 96% accuracy in the multiclass classification task
(healthy/orthopedic/neurological) and 82% accuracy in the binary classification
task (healthy/non-healthy) when generalizing to unseen dogs. Our results
demonstrate the potential of inertial-based deep learning models to serve as a
practical and objective diagnostic and clinical aid to differentiate gait
assessment in orthopedic and neurological conditions.

Abstract: The integration of Federated Learning (FL) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
presents a compelling pathway for training more powerful, large-scale
artificial intelligence models (LAMs) on decentralized data while preserving
privacy. However, efficient federated training of these complex MoE-structured
LAMs is hindered by significant system-level challenges, particularly in
managing the interplay between heterogeneous client resources and the
sophisticated coordination required for numerous specialized experts. This
article highlights a critical, yet underexplored concept: the absence of robust
quantitative strategies for dynamic client-expert alignment that holistically
considers varying client capacities and the imperative for system-wise load
balancing. Specifically, we propose a conceptual system design for intelligent
client-expert alignment that incorporates dynamic fitness scoring, global
expert load monitoring, and client capacity profiling. By tackling these
systemic issues, we can unlock more scalable, efficient, and robust training
mechanisms {with fewer communication rounds for convergence}, paving the way
for the widespread deployment of large-scale federated MoE-structured LAMs in
edge computing with ultra-high communication efficiency.

Motivation: 深度学习内核开发需手动调整参数，存在性能优化和推广障碍，AutoTriton旨在通过强化学习自动化这一过程。

Result: 在TritonBench和KernelBench上，AutoTriton性能媲美主流大模型，验证了其模块设计的重要性。

Conclusion: 强化学习可自动生成高性能内核，为高效AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Kernel development in deep learning requires optimizing computational units
across hardware while balancing memory management, parallelism, and
hardware-specific optimizations through extensive empirical tuning. Although
domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting
low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such
as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation,
creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In
this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton
programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming
expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based
reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming
ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of
TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves
performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet
and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial
role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage,
and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for
automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance
kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an
important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code

Conclusion: MobileGUI-RL提供了一种可扩展且高效的GUI代理在线训练方案。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of vision-based GUI agents designed to
automate everyday mobile and web tasks. These agents interpret raw GUI
screenshots and autonomously decide where to click, scroll, or type, which
bypasses handcrafted rules and app-specific APIs. However, most existing
methods trained GUI agent in the offline environment using pre-collected
trajectories. This approach limits scalability, causes overfitting to specific
UI templates, and leads to brittle policies when faced with unseen environment.
We present MobileGUI-RL, a scalable framework that trains GUI agent in online
environment. MobileGUI-RL contains two key components. It (i) synthesizes a
curriculum of learnable tasks through self-exploration and filtering, and (ii)
adapts GRPO to GUI navigation with trajectory-aware advantages and composite
rewards that balance task success and execution efficiency. Experiments on
three online mobile-agent benchmarks show consistent gains, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: With the emergence of compute-intensive and delay-sensitive applications in
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising
complement for vehicular edge computing due to the high mobility and flexible
deployment. However, the existing UAV-assisted offloading strategies are
insufficient in coordinating heterogeneous computing resources and adapting to
dynamic network conditions. Hence, this paper proposes a dual-layer
UAV-assisted edge computing architecture based on partial offloading, composed
of the relay capability of high-altitude UAVs and the computing support of
low-altitude UAVs. The proposed architecture enables efficient integration and
coordination of heterogeneous resources. A joint optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the system delay and energy consumption while ensuring
the task completion rate. To solve the high-dimensional decision problem, we
reformulate the problem as a Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical
offloading scheme based on the soft actor-critic algorithm. The method
decouples global and local decisions, where the global decisions integrate
offloading ratios and trajectory planning into continuous actions, while the
local scheduling is handled via designing a priority-based mechanism.
Simulations are conducted and demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms several baselines in task completion rate, system efficiency, and
convergence speed, showing strong robustness and applicability in dynamic
vehicular environments.

Abstract: AI-based methods have revolutionized atmospheric forecasting, with recent
successes in medium-range forecasting spurring the development of climate
foundation models. Accurate modeling of complex atmospheric dynamics at high
spatial resolutions and longer lead times requires large neural networks and
gigabyte-sized data samples, making accelerator memory and I/O-bandwidth the
bottlenecks for model training. We introduce WeatherMixer, a
multi-layer-perceptron-based architecture whose workload scales linearly with
input size, allowing the model to learn global weather phenomena at accuracies
similar to numerical weather prediction. To cope with the computational demand,
we propose Jigsaw, a novel model parallelization scheme that employs both
domain and tensor parallelism, eliminating memory redundancy. Jigsaw exceeds
state-of-the-art performance in strong scaling in compute-communication-limited
systems and achieves superscalar weak scaling in I/O-bandwidth-limited systems.
We scale training to 256 GPUs, reaching peak performances of 9 and 11 PFLOPs,
23% and 28% of theoretical peaks, achieving 68% and 72% scaling efficiency

insights into the underlying biomechanical processes of the cardiac tissues.

Dice scores of 0.945 for the left ventricular cavity, 0.908 for the right
ventricular cavity, and 0.905 for the myocardium. Subsequently, we estimate the
local strains within the moving heart and extract a detailed set of features
used for cardiovascular disease classification. We evaluated five
classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support
Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and Nearest Neighbour, and identified the
most relevant features using a feature selection algorithm. The best performing
classifier obtained a classification accuracy of 98% in the training set and
100% in the test set of the ACDC dataset. By integrating explainable artificial
intelligence, this method empowers clinicians with a transparent understanding
of the model's predictions based on cardiac mechanics, while also significantly
improving the accuracy and reliability of cardiac disease diagnosis, paving the
way for more personalized and effective patient care.

Key words: 动态图、时间序列预测、流量平衡分析（FBA）、图预测

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合时间序列预测方法和改进的流量平衡分析（FBA）的方法，用于预测动态图的时间序列结构，解决了现有方法假设顶点不变的局限性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 动态过程（如通信和交通网络）通常表现为离散时间序列图，而现有图预测方法假设顶点不变，无法适应顶点变化的场景，因此需要改进。

Method: 结合时间序列预测方法和改进的FBA（一种线性规划方法，适用于生物化学），通过引入适用于增长图的约束条件，预测图的结构变化。

Result: 在合成数据集（基于优先连接模型）和真实数据集（UCI Message、HePH、Facebook、Bitcoin）上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效预测动态图时间序列的未来结构，弥补了现有方法的不足，适用于顶点变化的场景。

Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can
be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of
such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps,
which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing
approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the
vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we
propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an
adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method
originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various
constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real
datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决小样本领域自适应中的两个核心问题：超参数调优不切实际和分布偏移下的模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 训练多个独立适配器（具有不同超参数），并将其输出平均化，最后通过参数拼接重新参数化为单一适配器。

Result: 提出的Soup-Adapter方法性能优于单个适配器，且对分布偏移更具鲁棒性，同时对关键超参数的敏感性显著降低。

Conclusion: Soup-Adapter有效解决了小样本领域自适应中的超参数和鲁棒性问题，并为CLIP和DINOv2的适配器技术提供了新的比较视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle two fundamental problems in few-shot domain
adaptation of foundation models. First, hyperparameter tuning is often
impractical due to the lack of large validation datasets. Second, model
robustness under distribution shifts where test time data deviates slightly
from training distributions, remains a concern. We show that by training
multiple independent adapters and averaging their outputs, the new model has a
higher performance and is more robust to distribution shifts compared to any
individual adapter. This improvement holds even when the adapters are trained
with diverse hyperparameters sampled from a wide range, resulting in varied
individual performance. Consequently, our method addresses both of the problems
described above. The ensemble is also significantly less sensitive to the
residual ratio, a critical hyperparameter of CLIP-Adapter. Since the ensemble
can be reparameterized to a single adapter again using a principled
concatenation of the parameters, we refer to our method as Soup-Adapter. This
is also the first study to explore CLIP adapter-style techniques for DINOv2 and
to directly compare them with CLIP in this setting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in domains
such as mathematics and programming, yet their capabilities in physics remain
underexplored and poorly understood. Physics poses unique challenges that
demand not only precise computation but also deep conceptual understanding and
physical modeling skills. Existing benchmarks often fall short due to limited
difficulty, multiple-choice formats, and static evaluation settings that fail
to capture physical modeling ability. In this paper, we introduce
ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs'
physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of
two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level
problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an
automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions.
All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and
tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical
reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics
provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific
reasoning in LLMs.

Result: 该框架能够系统地揭示模型决策背后的潜在信息流和语义表示，增强了模型的可解释性和可信度。

Conclusion: BAGEL框架为深度学习模型的全局解释性提供了新工具，有助于理解模型在数据偏见下的泛化行为。

Abstract: While concept-based interpretability methods have traditionally focused on
local explanations of neural network predictions, we propose a novel framework
and interactive tool that extends these methods into the domain of mechanistic
interpretability. Our approach enables a global dissection of model behavior by
analyzing how high-level semantic attributes (referred to as concepts) emerge,
interact, and propagate through internal model components. Unlike prior work
that isolates individual neurons or predictions, our framework systematically
quantifies how semantic concepts are represented across layers, revealing
latent circuits and information flow that underlie model decision-making. A key
innovation is our visualization platform that we named BAGEL (for Bias Analysis
with a Graph for global Explanation Layers), which presents these insights in a
structured knowledge graph, allowing users to explore concept-class
relationships, identify spurious correlations, and enhance model
trustworthiness. Our framework is model-agnostic, scalable, and contributes to
a deeper understanding of how deep learning models generalize (or fail to) in
the presence of dataset biases. The demonstration is available at
https://knowledge-graph-ui-4a7cb5.gitlab.io/.

Motivation: 当前领域泛化（DG）方法未考虑算法公平性，而公平性方法通常未考虑领域变化。为解决这一问题，论文研究了FairDG问题，旨在在未见目标域中同时优化预期风险和公平性。

Method: 论文提出了基于互信息的上界，用于多类分类任务和多组敏感属性的预期风险与公平性违规分析。基于此，设计了PAFDG框架，通过帕累托优化建模效用-公平性权衡。

Result: 在真实视觉和语言数据集上的实验表明，PAFDG在效用-公平性权衡方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAFDG框架成功解决了FairDG问题，提供了更好的效用-公平性权衡。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) and algorithmic fairness are two critical
challenges in machine learning. However, most DG methods focus only on
minimizing expected risk in the unseen target domain without considering
algorithmic fairness. Conversely, fairness methods typically do not account for
domain shifts, so the fairness achieved during training may not generalize to
unseen test domains. In this work, we bridge these gaps by studying the problem
of Fair Domain Generalization (FairDG), which aims to minimize both expected
risk and fairness violations in unseen target domains. We derive novel mutual
information-based upper bounds for expected risk and fairness violations in
multi-class classification tasks with multi-group sensitive attributes. These
bounds provide key insights for algorithm design from an information-theoretic
perspective. Guided by these insights, we introduce PAFDG (Pareto-Optimal
Fairness for Domain Generalization), a practical framework that solves the
FairDG problem and models the utility-fairness trade-off through Pareto
optimization. Experiments on real-world vision and language datasets show that
PAFDG achieves superior utility-fairness trade-offs compared to existing
methods.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过原型和适配器解决了联邦学习的关键问题，同时提供了内在解释性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively
training machine learning models across distributed data sources while
maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges
including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters
and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data
distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1)
provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical
heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed
surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite
varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning
class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the
lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model
weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each
client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising
communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we
conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which
provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable
capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in
accuracy over baseline algorithms.

Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and
real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under
faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and
robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into
the neural network architecture, PINNs improve estimation accuracy for
transmission grid applications under both normal and faulty conditions, while
also showing potential in addressing security concerns such as data
manipulation attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach
outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher
accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance
on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data
manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to
93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.

Abstract: Tabular data in relational databases represents a significant portion of
industrial data. Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost
importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not
specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a
novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of
tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our
method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph
Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to
obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step
approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities,
can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as
regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by
applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding
techniques.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based
approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of
reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based
methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion
imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and
struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in
contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and
adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward
signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of
structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions,
controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the
dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced:
rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by
task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and
adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design
considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for
principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

Result: 实验表明D2C在少量数据下实现高质量训练，例如SiT-XL/2架构仅用0.8%数据40k步达到FID 4.3。

Conclusion: D2C显著提升扩散模型训练效率，为资源受限场景提供可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various generative
tasks, but training them remains highly resource-intensive, often requiring
millions of images and many days of GPU computation. From a data-centric
perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation
as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a
"synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original
dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced
cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate
dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on
training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a
novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two
phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse
subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach
phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual
representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments
across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that
our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with
dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the
SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID
score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose significant challenges for AI model training in veterinary
medicine. This study examines expert assessment ambiguity in canine
auscultation data, highlights the negative impact of label noise on
classification performance, and introduces methods for label noise reduction.
To evaluate whether label noise can be minimized by incorporating multiple
expert opinions, a dataset of 140 heart sound recordings (HSR) was annotated
regarding the intensity of holosystolic heart murmurs caused by Myxomatous
Mitral Valve Disease (MMVD). The expert opinions facilitated the selection of
70 high-quality HSR, resulting in a noise-reduced dataset. By leveraging
individual heart cycles, the training data was expanded and classification
robustness was enhanced. The investigation encompassed training and evaluating
three classification algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest. While
AdaBoost and Random Forest exhibited reasonable performances, XGBoost
demonstrated notable improvements in classification accuracy. All algorithms
showed significant improvements in classification accuracy due to the applied
label noise reduction, most notably XGBoost. Specifically, for the detection of
mild heart murmurs, sensitivity increased from 37.71% to 90.98% and specificity
from 76.70% to 93.69%. For the moderate category, sensitivity rose from 30.23%
to 55.81% and specificity from 64.56% to 97.19%. In the loud/thrilling
category, sensitivity and specificity increased from 58.28% to 95.09% and from
84.84% to 89.69%, respectively. These results highlight the importance of
minimizing label noise to improve classification algorithms for the detection
of canine heart murmurs. Index Terms: AI diagnosis, canine heart disease, heart

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 尽管Adam在实践中非常成功，但其理论收敛性分析仍不完善。现有研究将其视为带动量的预条件随机梯度下降（SGDM），需要强假设和复杂技巧，导致难以验证和扩展。

Method: 将Adam重新表述为符号类优化器，形式为$x_{t+1} = x_t - \gamma_t \frac{|m_t|}{\sqrt{v_t}+\epsilon} \circ {\rm Sign}(m_t)$，从而简化分析。

Result: 在广义$p$-仿射方差和$(L_0, L_1, q)$-平滑的弱假设下，首次证明Adam以${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{1/4}})$的速率收敛，优于之前的${\cal O}\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{1/4}}\right)$。

Conclusion: 论文的新视角不仅简化了Adam的收敛性证明，还揭示了动量的关键作用，并提供了学习率调整的实用指导。

Abstract: Adam is widely recognized as one of the most effective optimizers for
training deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its remarkable empirical success,
its theoretical convergence analysis remains unsatisfactory. Existing works
predominantly interpret Adam as a preconditioned stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGDM), formulated as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t -
\frac{\gamma_t}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ \bm{m}_t$. This perspective
necessitates strong assumptions and intricate techniques, resulting in lengthy
and opaque convergence proofs that are difficult to verify and extend. In
contrast, we propose a novel interpretation by treating Adam as a sign-like
optimizer, expressed as $\bm{x}_{t+1} = \bm{x}_t - \gamma_t
\frac{|\bm{m}_t|}{{\sqrt{\bm{v}_t}+\epsilon}} \circ {\rm Sign}(\bm{m}_t)$. This
reformulation significantly simplifies the convergence analysis. For the first
time, with some mild conditions, we prove that Adam achieves the optimal rate
of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}})$ rather than the previous ${\cal O}
\left(\frac{\ln T}{T^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}\right)$ under weak assumptions of the
generalized $p$-affine variance and $(L_0, L_1, q)$-smoothness, without
dependence on the model dimensionality or the numerical stability parameter
$\epsilon$. Additionally, our theoretical analysis provides new insights into
the role of momentum as a key factor ensuring convergence and offers practical
guidelines for tuning learning rates in Adam, further bridging the gap between
theory and practice.

Abstract: In production recommender systems, feature preprocessing must be faithfully

Motivation: 高维低样本数（HDLSS）环境在应用中面临重大挑战，需要一种能够有效学习和泛化的方法。

Method: 使用多视图中融合技术，将高维特征向量拆分为多个子集（视图），提出三种视图构建方法。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在多种模型和任务中表现出色，具有广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: 为多视图中融合学习的通用优势研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) setting presents significant
challenges in various applications where the feature dimension far exceeds the
number of available samples. This paper introduces a universal approach for
learning in HDLSS setting using multi-view mid fusion techniques. It shows how
existing mid fusion multi-view methods perform well in an HDLSS setting even if
no inherent views are provided. Three view construction methods are proposed
that split the high-dimensional feature vectors into smaller subsets, each
representing a different view. Extensive experimental validation across
model-types and learning tasks confirm the effectiveness and generalization of
the approach. We believe the work in this paper lays the foundation for further
research into the universal benefits of multi-view mid fusion learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合局部与全局的卷积神经网络方法（LGCNN），用于解决地下水流动与热传输建模中数据质量低和计算成本高的问题，并成功应用于实际城市地下温度场建模。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 机器学习在科学和工程应用中常因训练数据有限或质量低而表现不佳，尤其是地下水流动和热传输这类复杂问题。传统数值模拟成本高，数据驱动模型在预测对流过程时效果较差。

Method: 引入Local-Global卷积神经网络（LGCNN），结合轻量级数值代理模型（全局）和卷积神经网络（局部），分别处理地下水速度场和热扩散过程。

Result: LGCNN成功建模了城市地下温度场，包括非均匀地下水流场和多个热泵注入点形成的长距离热羽流，并在实际数据上表现出良好的扩展性。

Conclusion: LGCNN为数据有限且计算复杂的地下水流动与热传输问题提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.

Result: QAT能将SSM模型的复杂度降低两个数量级，增强对抗模拟噪声的鲁棒性，并在模拟内存计算环境中实现高效部署。

Conclusion: QAT显著提升了SSM在边缘计算设备上的性能和效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Structured State Space models (SSM) have recently emerged as a new class of
deep learning models, particularly well-suited for processing long sequences.
Their constant memory footprint, in contrast to the linearly scaling memory
demands of Transformers, makes them attractive candidates for deployment on
resource-constrained edge-computing devices. While recent works have explored
the effect of quantization-aware training (QAT) on SSMs, they typically do not
address its implications for specialized edge hardware, for example, analog
in-memory computing (AIMC) chips. In this work, we demonstrate that QAT can
significantly reduce the complexity of SSMs by up to two orders of magnitude
across various performance metrics. We analyze the relation between model size
and numerical precision, and show that QAT enhances robustness to analog noise
and enables structural pruning. Finally, we integrate these techniques to
deploy SSMs on a memristive analog in-memory computing substrate and highlight
the resulting benefits in terms of computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoRE的方法，通过分析大型推理模型（LRMs）的隐藏状态轨迹，实现无标签的自我评估，并引入CoRE-Eval框架来动态终止冗余推理，显著提高了推理效率和准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中常出现过度思考（overthinking）现象，导致冗余步骤和效率低下。如何在不依赖外部标签的情况下，让模型自主评估其推理轨迹的正确性成为关键问题。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding（CoRE），通过分析隐藏状态轨迹的几何特征，发现冗余推理呈现周期性波动。基于此，开发了CoRE-Eval框架，动态检测并终止冗余推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试（GSM8K、MATH-500、AIME）中，CoRE-Eval减少推理链长度13.7%-33.2%，同时提高答案准确性约10%，32B模型在AIME上达到70.0%的准确率。

Conclusion: CoRE和CoRE-Eval为LRMs提供了无标签的自我评估能力，显著提升了推理效率和准确性，展示了在复杂推理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
domains like mathematics and program synthesis. Despite their strong
performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant
reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon
raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model
autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without
external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding
(CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free
self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance
metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the
geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant
reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to
repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we
further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework,
CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to
terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B
demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2%
while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the
challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.

Motivation: 解决强化学习策略在现实世界部署中的分布偏移、安全性问题以及直接交互的不切实际性。

Method: 使用评论家集合量化策略不确定性，引入渐进式环境随机化，迭代优化高不确定性状态区域。

Result: 在MuJoCo基准和四足机器人上验证，表现优于基线方法，实现了可靠的OOD检测、性能提升和样本效率。

Conclusion: UARL框架为安全强化学习提供了新思路，无需目标域训练即可实现鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.

*Dongyoon Kim,Sungjae Lee,Wonjin Lee,Kwang In Kim*

Key words: 零阶优化, Hessian估计, 子空间方法, 收敛加速

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于子空间的近似Hessian方法（ZO-SAH），通过随机选择子空间和周期性切换策略，显著降低了函数查询成本，并在实验中展示了比现有零阶优化方法更快的收敛速度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在梯度信息无法获取或计算不切实际的情况下，零阶优化方法通常依赖一阶近似。虽然引入二阶信息可以加速收敛，但Hessian矩阵的高计算成本限制了其实际应用。因此，需要一种高效的方法来利用二阶信息。

Method: ZO-SAH通过随机选择二维子空间，并在每个子空间中通过拟合二次多项式来估计Hessian。采用周期性子空间切换策略，复用函数评估结果以降低成本。

Result: 在八个基准数据集（包括逻辑回归和深度神经网络训练任务）上的实验表明，ZO-SAH比现有零阶优化方法收敛更快。

Conclusion: ZO-SAH通过高效利用子空间和周期性策略，显著降低了二阶信息估计的成本，同时提升了收敛速度。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization addresses problems where gradient information is
inaccessible or impractical to compute. While most existing methods rely on
first-order approximations, incorporating second-order (curvature) information
can, in principle, significantly accelerate convergence. However, the high cost
of function evaluations required to estimate Hessian matrices often limits
practical applicability. We present the subspace-based approximate Hessian
(ZO-SAH) method, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm that mitigates these
costs by focusing on randomly selected two-dimensional subspaces. Within each
subspace, ZO-SAH estimates the Hessian by fitting a quadratic polynomial to the
objective function and extracting its second-order coefficients. To further
reduce function-query costs, ZO-SAH employs a periodic subspace-switching
strategy that reuses function evaluations across optimization steps.
Experiments on eight benchmark datasets, including logistic regression and deep
neural network training tasks, demonstrate that ZO-SAH achieves significantly
faster convergence than existing zeroth-order methods.

Abstract: Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based
on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are
typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between
entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that
integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer
discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization
(BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix
factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a
46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).
These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current
and potential applications.
  An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with
probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto
coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also,
missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials,
suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our
method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known
superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the
superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in
a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific
literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific
documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating
from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new
hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive
Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了卷积层中混叠行为的基本特征，为稳定性优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Using a stride in a convolutional layer inherently introduces aliasing, which
has implications for numerical stability and statistical generalization. While
techniques such as the parametrizations via paraunitary systems have been used
to promote orthogonal convolution and thus ensure Parseval stability, a general
analysis of aliasing and its effects on the stability has not been done in this
context. In this article, we adapt a frame-theoretic approach to describe
aliasing in convolutional layers with 1D kernels, leading to practical
estimates for stability bounds and characterizations of Parseval stability,
that are tailored to take short kernel sizes into account. From this, we derive
two computationally very efficient optimization objectives that promote
Parseval stability via systematically suppressing aliasing. Finally, for layers
with random kernels, we derive closed-form expressions for the expected value
and variance of the terms that describe the aliasing effects, revealing
fundamental insights into the aliasing behavior at initialization.

Conclusion: 该方法为实现完全可训练的布尔逻辑提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for partial optimization of the connections in
Deep Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (LGNs). Our training method utilizes a

the connection with highest merit, after which the gate-types are selected. We
show that the connection-optimized LGNs outperform standard fixed-connection
LGNs on the Yin-Yang, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks, while requiring only
a fraction of the number of logic gates. When training all connections, we
demonstrate that 8000 simple logic gates are sufficient to achieve over 98% on
the MNIST data set. Additionally, we show that our network has 24 times fewer
gates, while performing better on the MNIST data set compared to standard fully
connected LGNs. As such, our work shows a pathway towards fully trainable
Boolean logic.

Conclusion: 差分设计经适当修改后可应用于Mamba，显著提升其性能，为相关模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication systems requires flexible,
energy-efficient, and cost-effective antenna technologies. Pinching antennas
(PAs), which can dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation through
binary activation states, have recently emerged as a promising candidate. In
this work, we investigate the problem of optimally selecting a subset of
fixed-position PAs to activate in a waveguide, when the aim is to maximize the
communication rate at a user terminal. Due to the complex interplay between
antenna activation, waveguide-induced phase shifts, and power division, this
problem is formulated as a combinatorial fractional 0-1 quadratic program. To
efficiently solve this challenging problem, we use neural network architectures
of varying complexity to learn activation policies directly from data,
leveraging spatial features and signal structure. Furthermore, we incorporate
user location uncertainty into our training and evaluation pipeline to simulate
realistic deployment conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed models.

Abstract: Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized
intersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for
signaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans

proposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous
descriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)
results, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or
ring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)
software and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first
leverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan
descriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and
phase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python
scripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic
signal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.
Within a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan
editing. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of
over 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300
plan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of
understanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an
easy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,
serving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile
application of LLMs in the field of ITS. The source codes, prompts and test
dataset are openly accessible at https://github.com/yuewangits/Chat2SPaT.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有的法律知识表示模型在表达复杂法律规则、上下文条件和例外时存在不足，需要一种更强大的方法来支持结构化的法律推理。

Method: OLG++通过扩展OLG模型，引入空间、时间、当事人组、可废止性等节点和边类型，支持属性图查询，从而实现对法律规则的更精细建模和推理。

Result: 通过食品业务法规的案例，展示了OLG++在表达法律规则和回答问题方面的能力，其表达性优于先前的基于图的法律知识表示模型。

Conclusion: OLG++为法律知识表示提供了一种更强大和灵活的方法，能够处理复杂的法律规则和例外。

Abstract: We present OLG++, a semantic extension of the Obligation Logic Graph (OLG)
for modeling regulatory and legal rules in municipal and interjurisdictional
contexts. OLG++ introduces richer node and edge types, including spatial,
temporal, party group, defeasibility, and logical grouping constructs, enabling
nuanced representations of legal obligations, exceptions, and hierarchies. The
model supports structured reasoning over rules with contextual conditions,
precedence, and complex triggers. We demonstrate its expressiveness through
examples from food business regulations, showing how OLG++ supports legal
question answering using property graph queries. OLG++ also improves over
LegalRuleML by providing native support for subClassOf, spatial constraints,
and reified exception structures. Our examples show that OLG++ is more
expressive than prior graph-based models for legal knowledge representation.

Abstract: Effectively evaluating deep research agents that autonomously search the web,
analyze information, and generate reports remains a major challenge,
particularly when it comes to assessing long reports and giving detailed
feedback on their intermediate steps. To address these gaps, we introduce Deep
Research Comparator, a platform that offers a holistic framework for deep
research agent hosting, side-by-side comparison, fine-grained human feedback
collection, and ranking calculation. Given a user query, our platform displays
the final reports from two different agents along with their intermediate steps
during generation. Annotators can evaluate the overall quality of final reports
based on side-by-side comparison, and also provide detailed feedback separately
by assessing intermediate steps or specific text spans within the final report.
Furthermore, we develop Simple Deepresearch, an end-to-end agent scaffold. This
scaffold serves as a baseline that facilitates the easy integration of various
large language models to transform them into deep research agents for
evaluation. To demonstrate the platform's utility for deep research agent
development, we have collected real user preference data from 17 annotators on
three deep research agents. A demo video of our platform can be found at

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for enabling AI-powered smart
assistants to interpret and reason in multimodal environments. However, their
application in augmented reality (AR) training remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we introduce a comprehensive dataset tailored for AR training,
featuring systematized vision-language tasks, and evaluate nine
state-of-the-art VLMs on it. Our results reveal that even advanced models,
including GPT-4o, struggle with fine-grained assembly tasks, achieving a
maximum F1 score of just 40.54% on state detection. These findings highlight
the demand for enhanced datasets, benchmarks, and further research to improve
fine-grained vision-language alignment. Beyond technical contributions, our
work has broader social implications, particularly in empowering blind and
visually impaired users with equitable access to AI-driven learning
opportunities. We provide all related resources, including the dataset, source

Conclusion: 通过模拟皮肤科医生的系统推理模式，该方法为更可靠的自动化诊断支持系统提供了路径。

Abstract: The second edition of the 2025 ImageCLEF MEDIQA-MAGIC challenge, co-organized
by researchers from Microsoft, Stanford University, and the Hospital Clinic of
Barcelona, focuses on multimodal dermatology question answering and
segmentation, using real-world patient queries and images. This work addresses
the Closed Visual Question Answering (CVQA) task, where the goal is to select
the correct answer to multiple-choice clinical questions based on both
user-submitted images and accompanying symptom descriptions. The proposed
approach combines three core components: (1) fine-tuning open-source multimodal
models from the Qwen, Gemma, and LLaMA families on the competition dataset, (2)
introducing a structured reasoning layer that reconciles and adjudicates
between candidate model outputs, and (3) incorporating agentic
retrieval-augmented generation (agentic RAG), which adds relevant information
from the American Academy of Dermatology's symptom and condition database to
fill in gaps in patient context. The team achieved second place with a
submission that scored sixth, demonstrating competitive performance and high
accuracy. Beyond competitive benchmarks, this research addresses a practical
challenge in telemedicine: diagnostic decisions must often be made
asynchronously, with limited input and with high accuracy and interpretability.
By emulating the systematic reasoning patterns employed by dermatologists when
evaluating skin conditions, this architecture provided a pathway toward more
reliable automated diagnostic support systems.

Conclusion: 有效的AI红队测试需要多学科团队，关注涌现风险、系统性漏洞以及技术与社会因素的相互作用。

Abstract: Red teaming has evolved from its origins in military applications to become a
widely adopted methodology in cybersecurity and AI. In this paper, we take a
critical look at the practice of AI red teaming. We argue that despite its
current popularity in AI governance, there exists a significant gap between red
teaming's original intent as a critical thinking exercise and its narrow focus
on discovering model-level flaws in the context of generative AI. Current AI
red teaming efforts focus predominantly on individual model vulnerabilities
while overlooking the broader sociotechnical systems and emergent behaviors
that arise from complex interactions between models, users, and environments.
To address this deficiency, we propose a comprehensive framework
operationalizing red teaming in AI systems at two levels: macro-level system
red teaming spanning the entire AI development lifecycle, and micro-level model
red teaming. Drawing on cybersecurity experience and systems theory, we further
propose a set of recommendations. In these, we emphasize that effective AI red
teaming requires multifunctional teams that examine emergent risks, systemic
vulnerabilities, and the interplay between technical and social factors.

Method: 采用GPT-4o-mini在零样本和三样本设置下生成CFs，并在两个数据集（压力预测和心脏病检测）上进行评估，与传统方法（如DiCE、CFNOW、NICE）对比。

Result: LLM生成的CFs在合理性（99%）、有效性（0.99）和稀疏性上表现优异，且作为增强数据使用时，能平均提升下游分类器5%的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于提示的生成技术在临床和生理预测任务中具有增强可解释性和鲁棒性的潜力。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer human-centric insights into machine
learning predictions by highlighting minimal changes required to alter an
outcome. Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality
prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. In this work, we
explore large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o-mini, for generating
CFs in a zero-shot and three-shot setting. We evaluate our approach on two
datasets: the AI-Readi flagship dataset for stress prediction and a public
dataset for heart disease detection. Compared to traditional methods such as
DiCE, CFNOW, and NICE, our few-shot LLM-based approach achieves high
plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and competitive
sparsity. Moreover, using LLM-generated CFs as augmented samples improves
downstream classifier performance (an average accuracy gain of 5%), especially
in low-data regimes. This demonstrates the potential of prompt-based generative
techniques to enhance explainability and robustness in clinical and
physiological prediction tasks. Code base: github.com/anonymous/SenseCF.

Motivation: 现有LoRA方法因矩阵间尺度差异导致训练不稳定和性能欠佳，需改进。

Method: 重新设计低秩适应为单矩阵分解，消除尺度冲突，减少参数量。

Result: 在语言模型和图像生成任务中表现优于LoRA和LoRA+，参数量减少40%。

Conclusion: SingLoRA通过单矩阵分解有效解决尺度冲突，提升性能并降低参数量。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has significantly advanced parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of large pretrained models. LoRA augments the pre-trained weights
of a model by adding the product of two smaller matrices that together form a
low-rank matrix update. Recent research has shown that scale disparities
between these two matrices often cause unstable training dynamics, leading to
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose SingLoRA, which reformulates
low-rank adaptation by learning the weights update as a decomposition of a
single low-rank matrix multiplied by its transpose. This simple design
inherently removes inter-matrix scale conflicts, ensuring stable optimization,
and roughly halves the parameter count. We analyze SingLoRA within the
infinite-width neural network framework, showing that it guarantees stable
feature learning by construction. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks
validate these benefits. In common sense reasoning, fine-tuning LLama 7B on
MNLI with SingLoRA achieves 91.3% accuracy - surpassing LoRA (89.1%) and LoRA+
(90.2%) - while using only 60% of their parameter budget. In image generation,
fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with SingLoRA significantly improves image
fidelity on DreamBooth, achieving a DINO similarity score of 0.151, compared to
scores of 0.148 and 0.143 for DoRA and LoRA, respectively.

allow researchers, practitioners, and regulators to: (i) make comparisons
between systems and the evaluation methods applied to them; (ii) connect
frontier AI evaluations with established quantitative risk analysis techniques
drawn from engineering and safety science; and (iii) foreground how what counts
as AI capability is contingent upon the measurement operations and scales we
elect to use. We sketch a layered measurement stack, distinguish direct from
indirect observables, and signpost how these ingredients provide a pathway
toward a unified, calibratable taxonomy of AI phenomena.

Abstract: Automated depression diagnosis aims to analyze multimodal information from
interview videos to predict participants' depression scores. Previous studies
often lack clear explanations of how these scores were determined, limiting
their adoption in clinical practice. While the advent of LLMs provides a
possible pathway for explainable depression diagnosis, current LLMs capable of
processing multimodal data lack training on interview data, resulting in poor
diagnostic performance when used directly. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal large language model (MLlm-DR) that can understand multimodal
information inputs and supports explainable depression diagnosis. MLlm-DR
integrates a smaller LLMs and a lightweight query module (LQ-former).
Specifically, the smaller LLMs is designed to generate depression scores and
corresponding evaluation rationales. To enhance its logical reasoning for
domain-specific tasks while maintaining practicality, we constructed a robust
training dataset to fine-tune it. Meanwhile, the LQ-former captures
depression-related features from speech and visual data, aiding the model's
ability to process multimodal information, to achieve comprehensive depression
diagnosis. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two
interview-based benchmark datasets, CMDC and E-DAIC-WOZ, demonstrating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) are opening up new
opportunities in geotechnical engineering and engineering geology. While
general-purpose LLMs possess broad capabilities, effective application in
geotechnics often requires domain-specific adaptation. Such tailored LLMs are
increasingly employed to streamline geotechnical workflows. This paper presents
the first survey of the adaptation and application of LLMs in geotechnical
engineering. It outlines key methodologies for adaptation to geotechnical
domain, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation,
domain-adaptive pretraining, and fine-tuning. The survey examines the
state-of-the-art applications of geotechnical-adapted LLMs, including
geological interpretation, subsurface characterization, site planning, design
calculations, numerical modeling, safety and risk assessment, and educational
tutoring. It also analyzes benefits and limitations of geotechnical-adapted
LLMs, and identifies promising directions for future research in this
interdisciplinary discipline. The findings serve as a valuable resource for
practitioners seeking to integrate LLMs into geotechnical practice, while also
providing a foundation to stimulate further investigation within the academic
community.

Conclusion: ADMC通过保持模态独立性和生成精确特征，显著提升了多模态识别性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion and intent recognition is essential for automated
human-computer interaction, It aims to analyze users' speech, text, and visual
information to predict their emotions or intent. One of the significant
challenges is that missing modalities due to sensor malfunctions or incomplete
data. Traditional methods that attempt to reconstruct missing information often
suffer from over-coupling and imprecise generation processes, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address these issues, we introduce an Attention-based
Diffusion model for Missing Modalities feature Completion (ADMC). Our framework
independently trains feature extraction networks for each modality, preserving
their unique characteristics and avoiding over-coupling. The Attention-based
Diffusion Network (ADN) generates missing modality features that closely align
with authentic multimodal distribution, enhancing performance across all
missing-modality scenarios. Moreover, ADN's cross-modal generation offers
improved recognition even in full-modality contexts. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and MIntRec benchmarks, demonstrating
its effectiveness in both missing and complete modality scenarios.

Result: 使用LLM生成问题的学生知识保留率显著更高（89% vs. 73%）。

Conclusion: LLM生成的检索问题有效支持学习，但需手动验证问题质量，以确保可扩展性。

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to
significantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,
generating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming
and labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical
subjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this
process by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness
of LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be
established. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two
college-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared
learning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated
multiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no
such questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to
LLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge
retention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without

can effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution
for integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite
these encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions
must be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors
must still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing
them to students.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展带来了信息传播的变革，但也加剧了虚假信息的传播。当前模型难以全面捕捉在线互动的复杂性，尤其是用户心理和行为动态。

Method: 提出基于SIP理论的SIP-CoT机制，并结合情感记忆，优化LLM代理的目标设定、反馈评估和社交线索解释。

Result: 实验显示，SIP-CoT增强的LLM代理在处理社交信息时更接近真实人类行为，态度和情感表现更准确。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLM在传播模拟中的不足，通过SIP-CoT和情感记忆的整合，显著提升了模拟的真实性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 为了促进联合国可持续发展目标，需要更可靠的城市级外国直接投资（FDI）预测方法。传统经济数据易被操纵，司法数据则能反映投资安全与回报。

Method: 基于1200万份公开裁决文件构建司法绩效评估指标体系，提出TLJD方法，结合行数据与列数据进行编码，并使用混合专家模型调整权重。

Result: TLJD在跨城市和跨时间任务中表现优异（R2至少0.92），优于其他十种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TLJD通过司法数据显著提高了FDI预测的可靠性和准确性，为地方政府决策提供了新工具。

Abstract: To advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on promoting
sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, foreign direct
investment (FDI) plays a crucial role in catalyzing economic expansion and
fostering innovation. Precise city-level FDI prediction is quite important for
local government and is commonly studied based on economic data (e.g., GDP).
However, such economic data could be prone to manipulation, making predictions
less reliable. To address this issue, we try to leverage large-scale judicial
data which reflects judicial performance influencing local investment security
and returns, for city-level FDI prediction. Based on this, we first build an
index system for the evaluation of judicial performance over twelve million
publicly available adjudication documents according to which a tabular dataset
is reformulated. We then propose a new Tabular Learning method on Judicial Data
(TLJD) for city-level FDI prediction. TLJD integrates row data and column data
in our built tabular dataset for judicial performance indicator encoding, and
utilizes a mixture of experts model to adjust the weights of different
indicators considering regional variations. To validate the effectiveness of
TLJD, we design cross-city and cross-time tasks for city-level FDI predictions.
Extensive experiments on both tasks demonstrate the superiority of TLJD (reach
to at least 0.92 R2) over the other ten state-of-the-art baselines in different
evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 探究AI生成治疗计划的评估问题，揭示人类与AI评估之间的差异及其对AI整合的挑战。

Method: 十位皮肤科医生、通用AI（GPT-4o）和推理AI（o3）生成治疗计划，由人类专家和高级AI（Gemini 2.5 Pro）匿名评分。

Result: 人类专家偏爱人类计划，而AI评判则反之，推理型AI被AI评判为最优，但在人类评分中排名靠后。

Conclusion: 评估者性质显著影响计划质量判断，需发展协同可解释的人机系统以弥合理念差异。

Abstract: Background: Evaluating AI-generated treatment plans is a key challenge as AI
expands beyond diagnostics, especially with new reasoning models. This study
compares plans from human experts and two AI models (a generalist and a
reasoner), assessed by both human peers and a superior AI judge.
  Methods: Ten dermatologists, a generalist AI (GPT-4o), and a reasoning AI
(o3) generated treatment plans for five complex dermatology cases. The
anonymized, normalized plans were scored in two phases: 1) by the ten human
experts, and 2) by a superior AI judge (Gemini 2.5 Pro) using an identical
rubric.
  Results: A profound 'evaluator effect' was observed. Human experts scored
peer-generated plans significantly higher than AI plans (mean 7.62 vs. 7.16;
p=0.0313), ranking GPT-4o 6th (mean 7.38) and the reasoning model, o3, 11th
(mean 6.97). Conversely, the AI judge produced a complete inversion, scoring AI
plans significantly higher than human plans (mean 7.75 vs. 6.79; p=0.0313). It
ranked o3 1st (mean 8.20) and GPT-4o 2nd, placing all human experts lower.
  Conclusions: The perceived quality of a clinical plan is fundamentally
dependent on the evaluator's nature. An advanced reasoning AI, ranked poorly by
human experts, was judged as superior by a sophisticated AI, revealing a deep
gap between experience-based clinical heuristics and data-driven algorithmic
logic. This paradox presents a critical challenge for AI integration,
suggesting the future requires synergistic, explainable human-AI systems that
bridge this reasoning gap to augment clinical care.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: AI模型在临床应用中常因真实世界的细微变化（如设备、光照或人口统计差异）而性能下降，目前缺乏高效且易用的工具来检测和修复这些问题。

Method: ModelAuditor通过与用户对话，选择任务特定的指标，模拟临床相关分布变化，并生成可解释的报告。

Result: 在三个临床场景中，ModelAuditor正确识别了失败模式并恢复15-25%的性能损失，成本低于0.5美元每次审计。

Conclusion: ModelAuditor提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，显著提升了AI模型在临床实践中的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.

Motivation: 微电网中电池健康状态的实时监测存在挑战，传统方法受限于操作约束，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 通过分析充电末期的放电脉冲，利用等效电路模型参数估计SoH。

Result: 实验显示，该方法能准确预测电池的退化程度，平均绝对误差约为1%，解释性评分接近0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法有望集成到电池管理系统中，为持续优化电池管理提供支持。

Abstract: Real-time monitoring of the state of health (SoH) of batteries remains a
major challenge, particularly in microgrids where operational constraints limit
the use of traditional methods. As part of the 4BLife project, we propose an
innovative method based on the analysis of a discharge pulse at the end of the
charge phase. The parameters of the equivalent electrical model describing the
voltage evolution across the battery terminals during this current pulse are
then used to estimate the SoH. Based on the experimental data acquired so far,
the initial results demonstrate the relevance of the proposed approach. After
training using the parameters of two batteries with a capacity degradation of
around 85%, we successfully predicted the degradation of two other batteries,
cycled down to approximately 90% SoH, with a mean absolute error of around 1%
in the worst case, and an explainability score of the estimator close to 0.9.
If these performances are confirmed, this method can be easily integrated into
battery management systems (BMS) and paves the way for optimized battery
management under continuous operation.

Motivation: 解决图形用户界面（GUI）代理在任务规划和视觉元素交互中遇到的两个主要挑战：任务规划的歧义性和高分辨率界面的精准交互问题。

Method: 1. 引入测试时扩展方法，通过采样候选动作提案并利用评判模型选择最优方案；2. 提出基于强化学习的模型，通过目标对齐提升视觉元素的精准交互能力。

Result: GTA1在多个基准测试中表现优异，例如在Screenspot-Pro、Screenspot-V2和OSWorld-G上的准确率分别达到50.1%、92.4%和67.7%。

Conclusion: GTA1通过测试时扩展和强化学习的结合，显著提升了GUI代理的决策质量和任务执行效率，为相关领域树立了新标杆。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents autonomously operate across platforms
(e.g., Linux) to complete tasks by interacting with visual elements.
Specifically, a user instruction is decomposed into a sequence of action
proposals, each corresponding to an interaction with the GUI. After each
action, the agent observes the updated GUI environment to plan the next step.
However, two main challenges arise: i) resolving ambiguity in task planning
(i.e., the action proposal sequence), where selecting an appropriate plan is
non-trivial, as many valid ones may exist; ii) accurately grounding actions in
complex and high-resolution interfaces, i.e., precisely interacting with visual
targets.
  This paper investigates the two aforementioned challenges with our GUI
Test-time Scaling Agent, namely GTA1. First, to select the most appropriate
action proposal, we introduce a test-time scaling method. At each step, we
sample multiple candidate action proposals and leverage a judge model to
evaluate and select the most suitable one. It trades off computation for better
decision quality by concurrent sampling, shortening task execution steps, and
improving overall performance. Second, we propose a model that achieves
improved accuracy when grounding the selected action proposal to its
corresponding visual elements. Our key insight is that reinforcement learning
(RL) facilitates visual grounding through inherent objective alignments,
rewarding successful clicks on interface elements.
  Experimentally, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks. For example, GTA1-7B achieves 50.1%, 92.4%, and 67.7%
accuracies on Screenspot-Pro, Screenspot-V2, and OSWorld-G, respectively. When
paired with a planner applying our test-time scaling strategy, it exhibits
state-of-the-art agentic performance (e.g., 45.2% task success rate on
OSWorld). We open-source our code and models here.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: LLM在ROP风险预测领域的应用尚未充分探索，论文旨在填补这一空白，并研究情感因素对模型性能的影响。

Method: 提出CROP数据集和Affective-ROPTester评估框架，采用三种提示策略（Instruction、CoT、ICL）结合情感元素分析LLM的预测能力和偏见。

Result: LLM依赖内在知识时预测效果有限，但引入外部知识后性能显著提升；情感偏见明显，正向情感提示有助于减少偏见。

Conclusion: 情感敏感的提示工程对提升诊断可靠性至关重要，Affective-ROPTester可作为评估和减轻临床语言模型中情感偏见的有效工具。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) across
various domains, their capacity to predict retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)
risk remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel
Chinese benchmark dataset, termed CROP, comprising 993 admission records
annotated with low, medium, and high-risk labels. To systematically examine the
predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk
stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation
framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme
assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and
ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy.
Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate
how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP
and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield
two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP
risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit
marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs.
Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent
inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared
to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating
predictive bias in model outputs. These findings highlight the critical role of
affect-sensitive prompt engineering in enhancing diagnostic reliability and
emphasize the utility of Affective-ROPTester as a framework for evaluating and
mitigating affective bias in clinical language modeling systems.

Abstract: There is growing excitement about building software verifiers, synthesizers,
and other Automated Reasoning (AR) tools by combining traditional symbolic
algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, the current
practice for constructing such neurosymbolic AR systems is an ad hoc
programming model that does not have the strong guarantees of traditional
symbolic algorithms, nor a deep enough synchronization of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to unlock the full potential of LLM-powered reasoning. I
propose Neurosymbolic Transition Systems as a principled computational model
that can underlie infrastructure for building neurosymbolic AR tools. In this
model, symbolic state is paired with intuition, and state transitions operate
over symbols and intuition in parallel. I argue why this new paradigm can scale
logical reasoning beyond current capabilities while retaining the strong
guarantees of symbolic algorithms, and I sketch out how the computational model
I propose can be reified in a logic programming language.

Abstract: With the advent of Transformers, time series forecasting has seen significant
advances, yet it remains challenging due to the need for effective sequence
representation, memory construction, and accurate target projection. Time
series forecasting remains a challenging task, demanding effective sequence
representation, meaningful information extraction, and precise future
projection. Each dataset and forecasting configuration constitutes a distinct
task, each posing unique challenges the model must overcome to produce accurate
predictions. To systematically address these task-specific difficulties, this
work decomposes the time series forecasting pipeline into three core stages:
input sequence representation, information extraction and memory construction,
and final target projection. Within each stage, we investigate a range of
architectural configurations to assess the effectiveness of various modules,
such as convolutional layers for feature extraction and self-attention
mechanisms for information extraction, across diverse forecasting tasks,
including evaluations on seven benchmark datasets. Our models achieve
state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while greatly enhancing computational
efficiency, with reduced training and inference times and a lower parameter

Abstract: Humans can imagine various atmospheres and settings when listening to music,
envisioning movie scenes that complement each piece. For example, slow,
melancholic music might evoke scenes of heartbreak, while upbeat melodies
suggest celebration. This paper explores whether a Music Language Model, e.g.
MU-LLaMA, can perform a similar task, called Music Scene Imagination (MSI),
which requires cross-modal information from video and music to train. To
improve upon existing music captioning models which focusing solely on musical
elements, we introduce MusiScene, a music captioning model designed to imagine
scenes that complement each music. In this paper, (1) we construct a
large-scale video-audio caption dataset with 3,371 pairs, (2) we finetune Music
Understanding LLaMA for the MSI task to create MusiScene, and (3) we conduct
comprehensive evaluations and prove that our MusiScene is more capable of

Abstract: We present BlueLM-2.5-3B, a compact and unified dense Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) designed for efficient edge-device deployment, offering
strong general-purpose and reasoning capabilities. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first 3B-scale MLLM to support both thinking and
non-thinking modes, while also enabling explicit control over thinking token
budget. BlueLM-2.5-3B is developed through diversified data curation, key data
resampling, hybrid heterogeneous reinforcement learning, and a high-performance
training infrastructure. Our model achieves superior multimodal capacity while
preserving competitive pure-text performance with only 2.9 billion parameters.
We conduct comprehensive evaluations across a broad range of multimodal and
text-only benchmarks. In thinking mode, BlueLM-2.5-3B achieves comparable
performance to Qwen3-4B on text-only benchmarks, and trails the larger
Kimi-VL-A3B-16B by only about 5% on average across multimodal evaluations. In
non-thinking mode, it outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-3B on the majority of multimodal
benchmarks. Additionally, BlueLM-2.5-3B exhibits exceptional data efficiency.
All of the aforementioned performance is achieved with substantially less total
training data than Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen3-4B. We hope our work contributes to
the advancement of high-performance, on-device MLLMs and provides meaningful
insights to the research community.

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 数据驱动的AI技术缺乏透明度，限制了其在医疗决策中的可解释性和接受度。

Method: 对规则预测模型中的属性进行统计分析，计算其对预测的相关性，并提供可解释的风险因素影响信息。

Result: 用户研究表明，相比原始可解释AI输出，该方法在解释性和实用性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了可解释AI在淋巴水肿风险评估中的透明度和实用性。

Abstract: The lack of transparency of data-driven Artificial Intelligence techniques
limits their interpretability and acceptance into healthcare decision-making
processes. We propose an attribution-based approach to improve the
interpretability of Explainable AI-based predictions in the specific context of
arm lymphedema's risk assessment after lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast
cancer. The proposed method performs a statistical analysis of the attributes
in the rule-based prediction model using standard metrics from Information
Retrieval techniques. This analysis computes the relevance of each attribute to
the prediction and provides users with interpretable information about the
impact of risk factors. The results of a user study that compared the output
generated by the proposed approach with the raw output of the Explainable AI
model suggested higher levels of interpretability and usefulness in the context
of predicting lymphedema risk.

TL;DR: HopeBot，一种基于LLM的聊天机器人，通过增强检索生成和实时澄清来实施PHQ-9抑郁筛查，显示与自评版本高度一致，用户反馈更信任并推荐该机器人。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 静态抑郁筛查工具（如PHQ-9）缺乏交互性和适应性，因此开发了HopeBot以提高用户体验和可访问性。

Method: 在132名成年人中进行自评和HopeBot版本PHQ-9的对比研究，评估成绩一致性和用户反馈。

Result: ICC为0.91，71%用户更信任HopeBot；87.1%愿意重复使用或推荐。

Conclusion: 基于语音的LLM聊天机器人可作为抑郁筛查的可扩展、低负担辅助工具。

Abstract: Static tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) effectively
screen depression but lack interactivity and adaptability. We developed
HopeBot, a chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM) that administers the
PHQ-9 using retrieval-augmented generation and real-time clarification. In a
within-subject study, 132 adults in the United Kingdom and China completed both
self-administered and chatbot versions. Scores demonstrated strong agreement
(ICC = 0.91; 45% identical). Among 75 participants providing comparative
feedback, 71% reported greater trust in the chatbot, highlighting clearer
structure, interpretive guidance, and a supportive tone. Mean ratings (0-10)
were 8.4 for comfort, 7.7 for voice clarity, 7.6 for handling sensitive topics,
and 7.4 for recommendation helpfulness; the latter varied significantly by
employment status and prior mental-health service use (p < 0.05). Overall,
87.1% expressed willingness to reuse or recommend HopeBot. These findings
demonstrate voice-based LLM chatbots can feasibly serve as scalable, low-burden
adjuncts for routine depression screening.

TL;DR: CogniSQL-R1-Zero是一种基于强化学习的框架，用于生成准确且可执行的SQL，在Text-to-SQL任务中实现最新技术水平的执行准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自然语言到SQL的转换中表现有所提升，但生成复杂查询的正确SQL仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，通过轻量级奖励信号（执行正确性和格式标记符合度）生成SQL，避免中间监督和复杂奖励设计。

Result: 在Text2SQL和BIRD基准测试中优于现有监督和指令调优基线模型，尽管使用的是较小的7B骨干网络。

Conclusion: 该RL方法展示了在小规模硬件资源下的可扩展性和高效性，并发布了两个数据集以推动研究。

Abstract: Translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL) remains a core challenge
at the intersection of language understanding and structured data access.
Although large language models (LLMs) have improved fluency, generating correct
and executable SQL, especially for complex queries, continues to be
challenging. We introduce CogniSQL-R1-Zero, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework and model that produces accurate SQL using a lightweight reward
signal based on execution correctness and format-tag compliance. By avoiding
intermediate supervision, hybrid pipelines and complex reward shaping, our
method encourages stable learning and stronger alignment with the ultimate task
objective-producing executable programs. CogniSQL-R1-Zero achieves
state-of-the-art execution accuracy on Text2SQL benchmark; BIRD bench,
outperforming prior supervised and instruction-tuned baselines including SFT
CodeS-7B, DeepSeek-Coder 236B, and Mistral 123B-despite being trained on a
significantly smaller 7B backbone. This result underscores the scalability and
efficiency of our RL-based approach when trained on just four NVIDIA A100 GPUs
(40 GB VRAM each). To support further research in efficient and interpretable
Text-to-SQL modeling, we release two curated datasets: (i) a collection of
5,024 reasoning traces with varying context lengths, and (ii) a
positive-sampled corpus of 36,356 corpus of weakly supervised queries, each
annotated with six semantically diverse reasoning paths. Together, these
contributions advance scalable, execution-aligned Text-to-SQL generation.

Motivation: 针对传统XAI方法在非专家用户中解释效果不佳的问题，提出FGNS方法以提升模型输出的可解释性。

Method: 采用Feature-Guided Neighbor Selection (FGNS)，结合局部和全局特征重要性选择代表性样本。

Result: 用户研究表明，FGNS显著提升了非专家识别模型错误的能力，同时保持了与正确预测的一致性，且选择更符合类别特征的邻居样本。

Conclusion: FGNS推动了模型解释与人类理解的对齐，但需要在解释质量与用户信任之间做进一步优化。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods often struggle to generate clear, interpretable
outputs for users without domain expertise. We introduce Feature-Guided
Neighbor Selection (FGNS), a post hoc method that enhances interpretability by
selecting class-representative examples using both local and global feature
importance. In a user study (N = 98) evaluating Kannada script classifications,
FGNS significantly improved non-experts' ability to identify model errors while
maintaining appropriate agreement with correct predictions. Participants made
faster and more accurate decisions compared to those given traditional k-NN
explanations. Quantitative analysis shows that FGNS selects neighbors that
better reflect class characteristics rather than merely minimizing
feature-space distance, leading to more consistent selection and tighter
clustering around class prototypes. These results support FGNS as a step toward
more human-aligned model assessment, although further work is needed to address
the gap between explanation quality and perceived trust.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: Lockean信念集在经典逻辑推理下通常不封闭，限制了其在信念修正理论中的应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两种表征封闭性的方法，并设计了一种最小化修正的概率更新方法。

Result: 展示了如何通过最小修正实现信念集的封闭性。

Conclusion: 通过概率方法和最小修正，解决了Lockean信念集在逻辑推理中的封闭性问题。

Abstract: Within the formal setting of the Lockean thesis, an agent belief set is
defined in terms of degrees of confidence and these are described in
probabilistic terms. This approach is of established interest, notwithstanding
some limitations that make its use troublesome in some contexts, like, for
instance, in belief change theory. Precisely, Lockean belief sets are not
generally closed under (classical) logical deduction. The aim of the present
paper is twofold: on one side we provide two characterizations of those belief
sets that are closed under classical logic deduction, and on the other we
propose an approach to probabilistic update that allows us for a minimal
revision of those beliefs, i.e., a revision obtained by making the fewest
possible changes to the existing belief set while still accommodating the new
information. In particular, we show how we can deductively close a belief set
via a minimal revision.

Motivation: LLM在数学和编程领域表现突出，但在需要特定领域知识的金融领域应用有限，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用多阶段框架FEVO，包括CPT扩展金融知识、SFT注入结构化推理模式，以及RL整合知识与推理。

Result: FEVO-R32B在五个金融基准测试中优于更大模型和专家模型，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FEVO框架有效提升了LLM在金融领域的性能，尤其在知识与推理结合方面表现突出。

Abstract: Advancements in reasoning for large language models (LLMs) have lead to
significant performance improvements for LLMs in various fields such as
mathematics and programming. However, research applying these advances to the
financial domain, where considerable domain-specific knowledge is necessary to
complete tasks, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce FEVO
(Financial Evolution), a multi-stage enhancement framework developed to enhance
LLM performance in the financial domain. FEVO systemically enhances LLM
performance by using continued pre-training (CPT) to expand financial domain
knowledge, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill structured, elaborate
reasoning patterns, and reinforcement learning (RL) to further integrate the
expanded financial domain knowledge with the learned structured reasoning. To
ensure effective and efficient training, we leverage frontier reasoning models
and rule-based filtering to curate FEVO-Train, high-quality datasets
specifically designed for the different post-training phases. Using our
framework, we train the FEVO series of models -- C32B, S32B, R32B -- from
Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate them on seven benchmarks to assess financial and
general capabilities, with results showing that FEVO-R32B achieves
state-of-the-art performance on five financial benchmarks against much larger
models as well as specialist models. More significantly, FEVO-R32B demonstrates
markedly better performance than FEVO-R32B-0 (trained from Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct
using only RL), thus validating the effectiveness of financial domain knowledge
expansion and structured, logical reasoning distillation

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 医疗设施的能源需求波动大，传统方法效率低下且成本高，亟需智能化的管理方案。

Method: 结合LSTM进行时间序列预测，遗传算法优化参数和负载平衡策略，SHAP提高模型透明度。

Result: LSTM的预测性能远超ARIMA和Prophet模型（MAE:21.69，RMSE:29.96），遗传算法和SHAP进一步提升了模型的适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗设施的能源管理提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，未来可探索实时部署和强化学习结合。

Abstract: This paper tackles the urgent need for efficient energy management in
healthcare facilities, where fluctuating demands challenge operational
efficiency and sustainability. Traditional methods often prove inadequate,
causing inefficiencies and higher costs. To address this, the study presents an
AI-based framework combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), genetic algorithm
(GA), and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), specifically designed for
healthcare energy management. Although LSTM is widely used for time-series
forecasting, its application in healthcare energy prediction remains
underexplored. The results reveal that LSTM significantly outperforms ARIMA and
Prophet models in forecasting complex, non-linear demand patterns. LSTM
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 21.69 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
of 29.96, far better than Prophet (MAE: 59.78, RMSE: 81.22) and ARIMA (MAE:
87.73, RMSE: 125.22), demonstrating superior performance. The genetic algorithm
is applied to optimize model parameters and improve load balancing strategies,
enabling adaptive responses to real-time energy fluctuations. SHAP analysis
further enhances model transparency by explaining the influence of different
features on predictions, fostering trust in decision-making processes. This
integrated LSTM-GA-SHAP approach offers a robust solution for improving
forecasting accuracy, boosting energy efficiency, and advancing sustainability
in healthcare facilities. Future research may explore real-time deployment and
hybridization with reinforcement learning for continuous optimization. Overall,
the study establishes a solid foundation for using AI in healthcare energy
management, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and resilience potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有评估方法依赖模拟环境或狭窄任务域，不足以全面评估现实AI代理的不安全行为。

Method: 开发OpenAgentSafety框架，支持真实工具交互和多任务评估，结合规则与LLM检测不安全行为。

Result: 测试显示，不同LLM在51.2%至72.7%的安全敏感任务中存在不安全行为。

Conclusion: 现实部署前需强化安全保障。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI agents capable of solving complex, everyday tasks, from
scheduling to customer service, have enabled deployment in real-world settings,
but their possibilities for unsafe behavior demands rigorous evaluation. While
prior benchmarks have attempted to assess agent safety, most fall short by
relying on simulated environments, narrow task domains, or unrealistic tool
abstractions. We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular
framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories.
Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real
tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash
shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user
tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is
designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites,
and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis
with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors.
Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe
behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7%
with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for
stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 探讨在强监督稀缺时如何通过弱偏好数据对提升语言模型性能，验证相对质量差异的有效性。

Method: 提出delta学习假设，通过配对弱模型生成的响应（如3B和1.5B模型）构建偏好数据，进行后训练。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，8B模型性能与先进开源模型Tulu 3相当，但依赖更弱的监督信号（如1.5B模型）。

Conclusion: delta学习证明了利用弱偏好数据对的潜力，为后训练提供了更简单、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of
the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is
scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of
individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each
individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain
this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points
suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised
finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled
experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data
generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even
smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard
11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the
performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base
model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta
learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art
post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic
regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides
useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that
models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be
considered weak.

Motivation: 由于实际中完整的因果图通常未知，尤其是在复杂或高维环境中，作者希望探索因果抽象的简化表示方法，以解决这一问题。

Method: 作者定义了多个可识别性标准，并将它们组织成一个层次化结构，以揭示不同因果知识水平下的可识别性关系。

Result: 通过文献中的案例验证，本文展示了该方法在不完全因果知识条件下如何有效识别因果查询。

Conclusion: 因果抽象的层次化框架为不完全因果知识下的因果推理提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Identifying the effect of a treatment from observational data typically
requires assuming a fully specified causal diagram. However, such diagrams are
rarely known in practice, especially in complex or high-dimensional settings.
To overcome this limitation, recent works have explored the use of causal
abstractions-simplified representations that retain partial causal information.
In this paper, we consider causal abstractions formalized as collections of
causal diagrams, and focus on the identifiability of causal queries within such
collections. We introduce and formalize several identifiability criteria under
this setting. Our main contribution is to organize these criteria into a
structured hierarchy, highlighting their relationships. This hierarchical view
enables a clearer understanding of what can be identified under varying levels
of causal knowledge. We illustrate our framework through examples from the
literature and provide tools to reason about identifiability when full causal
knowledge is unavailable.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 尽管现有的评分规则在文本信息提取中具有可证明的正确性，但它们并不总能很好地与人类偏好对齐。因此，需要一种新的评分规则来同时满足正确性和人类偏好。

Method: 设计了Aligned Scoring Rule (ASR)，通过优化并最小化一个正确评分规则与参考评分（如人类评分）之间的均方误差来实现。

Result: 实验表明，ASR在保持评分规则正确性的同时，优于之前的方法，更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: ASR成功地在文本生成中平衡了评分规则的正确性与人类偏好，为信息提取任务提供了一种更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Scoring rules elicit probabilistic predictions from a strategic agent by
scoring the prediction against a ground truth state. A scoring rule is proper
if, from the agent's perspective, reporting the true belief maximizes the
expected score. With the development of language models, Wu and Hartline (2024)
proposes a reduction from textual information elicitation to the numerical
(i.e. probabilistic) information elicitation problem, which achieves provable
properness for textual elicitation. However, not all proper scoring rules are
well aligned with human preference over text. Our paper designs the Aligned
Scoring rule (ASR) for text by optimizing and minimizing the mean squared error
between a proper scoring rule and a reference score (e.g. human score). Our
experiments show that our ASR outperforms previous methods in aligning with
human preference while maintaining properness.

Motivation: 现有ASR评估多限于无上下文场景，缺乏对上下文建模和世界知识推理能力的评估，需要一种全面评估ASR系统通用性和智能性的基准。

Method: 开发了一个包含40,000多条数据、覆盖10多个领域的基准测试ContextASR-Bench，评估模型在不同粒度上下文场景下的表现和命名实体识别能力。

Result: 实验表明，具备强大世界知识和上下文学习能力的LALMs显著优于传统ASR模型。

Conclusion: ContextASR-Bench填补了ASR评估的空白，为未来上下文语音识别研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively investigated, yet
prior evaluative efforts have largely been restricted to contextless paradigms.
This constraint stems from the limited proficiency of conventional ASR models
in context modeling and their deficiency in memory and reasoning based on world
knowledge. Recent breakthroughs in the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and corresponding Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have markedly
enhanced the visibility of general artificial intelligence capabilities.
Consequently, there exists a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate
both the generality and intelligence of ASR systems. To address this gap, we
propose ContextASR-Bench: a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark designed to
assess contextual speech recognition. This benchmark encompasses up to 40,000
data entries across over 10 domains, enabling a thorough evaluation of model
performance in scenarios that omit or incorporate coarse-grained or
fine-grained contextual information. Moreover, diverging from conventional ASR
evaluations, our benchmark includes an analysis of model efficacy in
recognizing named entities mentioned within the auditory input. Our extensive
evaluation highlights that LALMs, with strong world knowledge and context
learning capabilities, outperform conventional ASR models by a large margin.
The dataset and evaluation code have been released at

Main category: q-fin.PM

Motivation: 现有学习算法在线投资组合优化中表现不佳，且难以处理高维特征选择问题。利用资产回报的序列依赖性（如日历效应）可改善性能。

Method: 提出一种算法，仅通过逐步揭示的数据学习序列依赖性，无需分布假设；推广Kelly准则以适应序列依赖性。

Result: 算法在理论和实验中均优于固定再平衡策略，且在随机市场中仍能渐进达到最优增长率。

Conclusion: 算法具有广泛适用性，尤其在序列依赖性显著的市场中表现优异。

Abstract: In the online portfolio optimization framework, existing learning algorithms
generate strategies that yield significantly poorer cumulative wealth compared
to the best constant rebalancing portfolio in hindsight, despite being
consistent in asymptotic growth rate. While this unappealing performance can be
improved by incorporating more side information, it raises difficulties in
feature selection and high-dimensional settings. Instead, the inherent serial
dependence of assets' returns, such as day-of-the-week and other calendar
effects, can be leveraged. Although latent serial dependence patterns are
commonly detected using large training datasets, this paper proposes an
algorithm that learns such dependence using only gradually revealed data,
without any assumption on their distribution, to form a strategy that
eventually exceeds the cumulative wealth of the best constant rebalancing
portfolio.
  Moreover, the classical Kelly criterion, which requires independent assets'
returns, is generalized to accommodate serial dependence in a market modeled as
an independent and identically distributed process of random matrices. In such
a stochastic market, where existing learning algorithms designed for stationary
processes fail to apply, the proposed learning algorithm still generates a
strategy that asymptotically grows to the highest rate among all strategies,
matching that of the optimal strategy constructed under the generalized Kelly
criterion. The experimental results with real market data demonstrate the
theoretical guarantees of the algorithm and its performance as expected, as
long as serial dependence is significant, regardless of the validity of the
generalized Kelly criterion in the experimental market. This further affirms
the broad applicability of the algorithm in general contexts.

Main category: cs.DB

Motivation: 数据库研究需要大量SQL查询进行基准测试，但获取真实查询因隐私问题困难，现有生成方法缺乏定制化和满足现实约束的能力。

Method: SQLBarber结合声明式界面、LLM驱动的管道（含自校正模块）和贝叶斯优化器，生成符合用户定义成本分布的SQL查询。

Result: 实验显示，SQLBarber能唯一生成定制化SQL模板，生成时间减少1-3个数量级，并显著提升与目标成本分布的匹配度。

Conclusion: SQLBarber解决了SQL查询生成的效率和真实性问题，适合数据库研究需求。

Abstract: Database research and development often require a large number of SQL queries
for benchmarking purposes. However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is
challenging due to privacy concerns, and existing SQL generation methods are
limited in customization and in satisfying realistic constraints. To address
this issue, we present SQLBarber, a system based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate customized and realistic SQL workloads. SQLBarber (i)
eliminates the need for users to manually craft SQL templates in advance, while
providing the flexibility to accept natural language specifications to
constrain SQL templates, (ii) scales efficiently to generate large volumes of
queries matching any user-defined cost distribution (e.g., cardinality and
execution plan cost), and (iii) uses execution statistics from Amazon Redshift
and Snowflake to derive SQL template specifications and query cost
distributions that reflect real-world query characteristics. SQLBarber
introduces (i) a declarative interface for users to effortlessly generate
customized SQL templates, (ii) an LLM-powered pipeline augmented with a
self-correction module that profiles, refines, and prunes SQL templates based
on query costs, and (iii) a Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore different
predicate values and identify a set of queries that satisfy the target cost
distribution. We construct and open-source ten benchmarks of varying difficulty
levels and target query cost distributions based on real-world statistics from
Snowflake and Amazon Redshift. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show
that SQLBarber is the only system that can generate customized SQL templates.
It reduces query generation time by one to three orders of magnitude, and
significantly improves alignment with the target cost distribution, compared
with existing methods.

Main category: cs.DB

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速迭代，提示（prompt）的不稳定性导致生成式AI应用行为不一致，影响商业应用的可靠性。

Method: 提出提示迁移框架，包括提示重新设计和迁移测试平台，并以Tursio企业搜索应用为案例验证其有效性。

Result: 结构化提示迁移能完全恢复因模型漂移而损失的应用程序可靠性。

Conclusion: 提示生命周期管理和鲁棒测试对确保生成式AI商业应用的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Generative AI is transforming business applications by enabling natural
language interfaces and intelligent automation. However, the underlying large
language models (LLMs) are evolving rapidly and so prompting them consistently
is a challenge. This leads to inconsistent and unpredictable application
behavior, undermining the reliability that businesses require for
mission-critical workflows. In this paper, we introduce the concept of prompt
migration as a systematic approach to stabilizing GenAI applications amid
changing LLMs. Using the Tursio enterprise search application as a case study,
we analyze the impact of successive GPT model upgrades, detail our migration
framework including prompt redesign and a migration testbed, and demonstrate
how these techniques restore application consistency. Our results show that
structured prompt migration can fully recover the application reliability that
was lost due to model drift. We conclude with practical lessons learned,
emphasizing the need for prompt lifecycle management and robust testing to
ensure dependable GenAI-powered business applications.

Abstract: Complex networks have become essential tools for understanding diverse
phenomena in social systems, traffic systems, biomolecular systems, and
financial systems. Identifying critical nodes is a central theme in
contemporary research, serving as a vital bridge between theoretical
foundations and practical applications. Nevertheless, the intrinsic complexity
and structural heterogeneity characterizing real-world networks, with
particular emphasis on dynamic and higher-order networks, present substantial
obstacles to the development of universal frameworks for critical node
identification. This paper provides a comprehensive review of critical node
identification techniques, categorizing them into seven main classes:
centrality, critical nodes deletion problem, influence maximization, network
control, artificial intelligence, higher-order and dynamic methods. Our review
bridges the gaps in existing surveys by systematically classifying methods
based on their methodological foundations and practical implications, and by
highlighting their strengths, limitations, and applicability across different
network types. Our work enhances the understanding of critical node research by
identifying key challenges, such as algorithmic universality, real-time
evaluation in dynamic networks, analysis of higher-order structures, and
computational efficiency in large-scale networks. The structured synthesis
consolidates current progress and highlights open questions, particularly in
modeling temporal dynamics, advancing efficient algorithms, integrating machine
learning approaches, and developing scalable and interpretable metrics for
complex systems.

Conclusion: 权重限制校准技术显著提升了伪熵特征化的效率和通用性，同时证明了多校准和校准多精度在字母表依赖关系上的指数级复杂性是无法避免的。

Abstract: Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise
demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and
computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization
that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and
non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general
family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon
entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the
characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved
by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational
hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is
that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on
algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability
(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving
pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates
the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic
Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)
and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to
achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet
size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and
Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show
that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for
multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of stable acoustic relay assignment in an
underwater acoustic network. Unlike the objectives of most existing literature,
two distinct objectives, namely classical stable arrangement and ambiguous
stable arrangement, are considered. To achieve these stable arrangements, a
laser chaos-based multi-processing learning (LC-ML) method is introduced to
efficiently obtain high throughput and rapidly attain stability. In order to
sufficiently explore the relay's decision-making, this method uses random
numbers generated by laser chaos to learn the assignment of relays to multiple
source nodes. This study finds that the laser chaos-based random number and
multi-processing in the exchange process have a positive effect on higher
throughput and strong adaptability with environmental changing over time.
Meanwhile, ambiguous cognitions result in the stable configuration with less
volatility compared to accurate ones. This provides a practical and useful
method and can be the basis for relay selection in complex underwater
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in song identification leverage deep neural networks to learn
compact audio fingerprints directly from raw waveforms. While these methods
perform well under controlled conditions, their accuracy drops significantly in
real-world scenarios where the audio is captured via mobile devices in noisy
environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol designed
to better reflect such real-world conditions. We generate three recordings of
the same audio, each with increasing levels of noise, captured using a mobile
device's microphone. Our results reveal a substantial performance drop for two
state-of-the-art CNN-based models under this protocol, compared to previously
reported benchmarks. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the
augmentation pipeline during training with contrastive loss. By introduction
low pass and high pass filters in the augmentation pipeline we significantly
increase the performance of both systems in our proposed evaluation.
Furthermore, we develop a transformer-based model with a tailored projection
module and demonstrate that transferring knowledge from a semantically relevant
domain yields a more robust solution. The transformer architecture outperforms
CNN-based models across all noise levels, and query durations. In low noise
conditions it achieves 47.99% for 1-sec queries, and 97% for 10-sec queries in
finding the correct song, surpassing by 14%, and by 18.5% the second-best
performing model, respectively, Under heavy noise levels, we achieve a
detection rate 56.5% for 15-second query duration. All experiments are
conducted on public large-scale dataset of over 100K songs, with queries
matched against a database of 56 million vectors.

Motivation: 传统基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）方法在TTS中依赖于合成音频，而DiffRO旨在通过直接使用神经编解码器令牌优化奖励函数，简化训练过程并提升性能。

Method: DiffRO利用Gumbel-Softmax技术使奖励函数可微分，并引入多任务奖励模型（MTR）从多角度提供反馈。

Result: 实验表明，DiffRO显著提高了TTS系统的发音准确性，在seed-tts-eval基准测试中达到SOTA的WER结果，且MTR模型支持零样本情感和质量控制。

Conclusion: DiffRO通过直接优化神经编解码器令牌和多任务奖励模型，显著提升了TTS系统的性能和可控性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO)
method aimed at enhancing the performance of neural codec language models based
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In contrast to conventional reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches applied to TTS, DiffRO directly
compute the rewards based on neural codec tokens, rather than relying on
synthesized audio. Furthermore, we employ the Gumbel-Softmax technique to
render the reward function differentiable, thereby streamlining the RLHF
training process. Additionally, we introduce a multi-task reward (MTR) model
which can provide feedback from different perspectives and find that it can
augment the system's capability to follow instructions effectively.Experimental
results indicate that DiffRO significantly improves the pronunciation accuracy
of the TTS system, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) WER results on the
seed-tts-eval benchmark. Moreover, with the integration of the MTR model, we
demonstrate the ability to control emotional and quality attributes in a
zero-shot manner.

Abstract: Automatic speech quality assessment plays a crucial role in the development
of speech synthesis systems, but existing models exhibit significant
performance variations across different granularity levels of prediction tasks.
This paper proposes an enhanced MOS prediction system based on self-supervised
learning speech models, incorporating a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classification
head and utilizing synthetic data from multiple commercial generation models
for data augmentation. Our method builds upon existing self-supervised models
such as wav2vec2, designing a specialized MoE architecture to address different
types of speech quality assessment tasks. We also collected a large-scale
synthetic speech dataset encompassing the latest text-to-speech, speech
conversion, and speech enhancement systems. However, despite the adoption of
the MoE architecture and expanded dataset, the model's performance improvements
in sentence-level prediction tasks remain limited. Our work reveals the
limitations of current methods in handling sentence-level quality assessment,
provides new technical pathways for the field of automatic speech quality
assessment, and also delves into the fundamental causes of performance
differences across different assessment granularities.

Conclusion: PFNN是一种可解释且高精度的神经网络架构，显式尊重边界条件，适用于椭圆偏微分方程的正反问题求解。

Abstract: Building on our previous work introducing Fredholm Neural Networks (Fredholm
NNs/ FNNs) for solving integral equations, we extend the framework to tackle
forward and inverse problems for linear and semi-linear elliptic partial
differential equations. The proposed scheme consists of a deep neural network
(DNN) which is designed to represent the iterative process of fixed-point
iterations for the solution of elliptic PDEs using the boundary integral method
within the framework of potential theory. The number of layers, weights, biases
and hyperparameters are computed in an explainable manner based on the
iterative scheme, and we therefore refer to this as the Potential Fredholm
Neural Network (PFNN). We show that this approach ensures both accuracy and
explainability, achieving small errors in the interior of the domain, and near
machine-precision on the boundary. We provide a constructive proof for the
consistency of the scheme and provide explicit error bounds for both the
interior and boundary of the domain, reflected in the layers of the PFNN. These
error bounds depend on the approximation of the boundary function and the
integral discretization scheme, both of which directly correspond to components
of the Fredholm NN architecture. In this way, we provide an explainable scheme
that explicitly respects the boundary conditions. We assess the performance of
the proposed scheme for the solution of both the forward and inverse problem
for linear and semi-linear elliptic PDEs in two dimensions.

Result: WENO3-CADNNs在多种基准测试中表现优异，优于WENO3-Z，精度接近WENO5-JS。

Conclusion: 神经网络能有效替代传统WENO加权过程，提高计算效率和精度。

Abstract: In this work, we present the feedforward neural network based on the
conservative approximation to the derivative from point values, for the
weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes in solving hyperbolic
conservation laws. The feedforward neural network, whose inputs are point
values from the three-point stencil and outputs are two nonlinear weights,
takes the place of the classical WENO weighting procedure. For the training
phase, we employ the supervised learning and create a new labeled dataset for
one-dimensional conservative approximation, where we construct a numerical flux
function from the given point values such that the flux difference approximates
the derivative to high-order accuracy. The symmetric-balancing term is
introduced for the loss function so that it propels the neural network to match
the conservative approximation to the derivative and satisfy the symmetric
property that WENO3-JS and WENO3-Z have in common. The consequent WENO schemes,
WENO3-CADNNs, demonstrate robust generalization across various benchmark
scenarios and resolutions, where they outperform WENO3-Z and achieve accuracy
comparable to WENO5-JS.

Motivation: 实时通信系统需要准确的带宽估计，传统启发式方法适应性有限，在线强化学习成本高且可能中断服务，离线强化学习虽具潜力但存在OOD问题和部署挑战。

Method: 提出RBWE框架，集成Q-ensemble和高斯混合策略以减少OOD风险，并引入回退机制确保部署稳定。

Result: 实验显示RBWE减少估计误差18%，提升10分位用户体验18.6%。

Conclusion: RBWE在离线强化学习基础上通过创新方法有效解决带宽估计问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication
(RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability
under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from
high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which
leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a
promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD)
actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable
deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust
bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble
(an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD
risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment
stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty.
Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and
improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.

Motivation: 由于大规模数据集（如LAION-5B）的噪声和非结构化性质，生成式文本到图像模型在提示遵从性上表现不佳，用户需依赖大量prompt工程。

Method: 提出Re-LAION-Caption 19M数据集，包含19百万1024x1024图像及其规范化caption，分为四部分：主体、场景、美学和相机细节。使用该数据集对PixArt-Σ和Stable Diffusion 2进行微调。

Result: 结构化caption版本的模型在VQA模型评估中表现出更高的文本-图像对齐分数。

Conclusion: 规范化训练数据的caption结构能显著提升模型的可控性和对齐性，提供更稳定的输出。

Abstract: We argue that generative text-to-image models often struggle with prompt
adherence due to the noisy and unstructured nature of large-scale datasets like
LAION-5B. This forces users to rely heavily on prompt engineering to elicit
desirable outputs. In this work, we propose that enforcing a consistent caption
structure during training can significantly improve model controllability and

Re-LAION-5B, comprising 19 million 1024x1024 images with captions generated by
a Mistral 7B Instruct-based LLaVA-Next model. Each caption follows a four-part
template: subject, setting, aesthetics, and camera details. We fine-tune
PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Stable Diffusion 2 using both structured and randomly
shuffled captions, and show that structured versions consistently yield higher
text-image alignment scores using visual question answering (VQA) models. The

Motivation: 随着图像生成技术的快速发展，面部深度伪造的普及对安全领域带来了巨大挑战，亟需有效的检测方法。现有方法存在解释性不足或易产生幻觉的问题。

Method: 设计了CorrDetail框架，通过错误指导的问题修正真实伪造细节，并引入了视觉细粒度细节增强模块和融合决策策略。

Result: CorrDetail在最新方法中表现出色，不仅能准确识别伪造细节，还具备强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CorrDetail为解决深度伪造检测的挑战提供了一种高效且可解释的方案。

Abstract: With the swift progression of image generation technology, the widespread
emergence of facial deepfakes poses significant challenges to the field of
security, thus amplifying the urgent need for effective deepfake
detection.Existing techniques for face forgery detection can broadly be
categorized into two primary groups: visual-based methods and multimodal
approaches. The former often lacks clear explanations for forgery details,
while the latter, which merges visual and linguistic modalities, is more prone
to the issue of hallucinations.To address these shortcomings, we introduce a
visual detail enhanced self-correction framework, designated CorrDetail, for
interpretable face forgery detection. CorrDetail is meticulously designed to
rectify authentic forgery details when provided with error-guided questioning,
with the aim of fostering the ability to uncover forgery details rather than
yielding hallucinated responses. Additionally, to bolster the reliability of
its findings, a visual fine-grained detail enhancement module is incorporated,
supplying CorrDetail with more precise visual forgery details. Ultimately, a
fusion decision strategy is devised to further augment the model's
discriminative capacity in handling extreme samples, through the integration of
visual information compensation and model bias reduction.Experimental results
demonstrate that CorrDetail not only achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the latest methodologies but also excels in accurately identifying
forged details, all while exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在跨模态理解上表现优异，但缺乏对细粒度文化差异的识别能力，主要由于高质量文化特定数据集的稀缺、上下文知识的缺乏以及难负样本的不足。

Method: 设计了一个数据生成流程，利用开源视觉语言模型和文本到图像扩散模型构建合成文化数据集CulTwin，并通过定制对比学习微调CLIP，创建CultureCLIP。

Result: 实验表明，CultureCLIP在文化相关基准测试中优于基础CLIP，某些任务中细粒度概念识别提高了5.49%，同时保留了通用能力。

Conclusion: 研究验证了数据合成和模型训练范式的有效性，能够捕捉细微的文化差异。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal
understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual
features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally
distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality
culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the
absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these
challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages
open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a
synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired
concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but
represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to
create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced
captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling
finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities.
Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms
the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained
concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original
generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and
VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable
generalization in zero- and few-shot settings, but adapting them efficiently to
decentralized, heterogeneous data remains a challenge. While prompt tuning has
emerged as a popular parameter-efficient approach in personalized federated
learning, existing methods often sacrifice generalization in favor of
personalization, struggling particularly on unseen classes or domains. In this
work, we propose pFedMMA, the first personalized federated learning framework
that leverages multi-modal adapters for vision-language tasks. Each adapter
contains modality-specific up- and down-projection layers alongside a globally
shared projection that aligns cross-modal features. Our asymmetric optimization
strategy allows clients to locally adapt to personalized data distributions
while collaboratively training the shared projection to improve global
generalization. This design is also communication-efficient, as only the shared
component is exchanged during rounds. Through extensive experiments across
eleven datasets, including domain- and label-shift scenarios, we show that
pFedMMA achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between personalization and
generalization, outperforming recent federated prompt tuning methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/sajjad-ucsb/pFedMMA.

Abstract: Motion generation, the task of synthesizing realistic motion sequences from
various conditioning inputs, has become a central problem in computer vision,
computer graphics, and robotics, with applications ranging from animation and
virtual agents to human-robot interaction. As the field has rapidly progressed
with the introduction of diverse modeling paradigms including GANs,
autoencoders, autoregressive models, and diffusion-based techniques, each
approach brings its own advantages and limitations. This growing diversity has
created a need for a comprehensive and structured review that specifically
examines recent developments from the perspective of the generative approach
employed.
  In this survey, we provide an in-depth categorization of motion generation
methods based on their underlying generative strategies. Our main focus is on
papers published in top-tier venues since 2023, reflecting the most recent
advancements in the field. In addition, we analyze architectural principles,
conditioning mechanisms, and generation settings, and compile a detailed
overview of the evaluation metrics and datasets used across the literature. Our
objective is to enable clearer comparisons and identify open challenges,
thereby offering a timely and foundational reference for researchers and
practitioners navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of motion generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation function by progressively adding noise
to an image set and training a model to separate out the signal from the noise.
The noise profile used by these models is white noise -- that is, noise based
on independent normal distributions at each point whose mean and variance is
independent of the scale. By contrast, most natural image sets exhibit a type
of scale invariance in their low-order statistical properties characterized by
a power-law scaling. Consequently, natural images are closer (in a quantifiable
sense) to a different probability distribution that emphasizes large scale
correlations and de-emphasizes small scale correlations. These scale invariant
noise profiles can be incorporated into diffusion models in place of white
noise to form what we will call a ``Cloud Diffusion Model". We argue that these
models can lead to faster inference, improved high-frequency details, and
greater controllability. In a follow-up paper, we will build and train a Cloud
Diffusion Model that uses scale invariance at a fundamental level and compare
it to classic, white noise diffusion models.

Abstract: Uniform and excessive herbicide application in modern agriculture contributes
to increased input costs, environmental pollution, and the emergence of
herbicide resistant weeds. To address these challenges, we developed a vision
guided, AI-driven variable rate sprayer system capable of detecting weed
presence, estimating canopy size, and dynamically adjusting nozzle activation
in real time. The system integrates lightweight YOLO11n and YOLO11n-seg deep
learning models, deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano for onboard inference,
and uses an Arduino Uno-based relay interface to control solenoid actuated
nozzles based on canopy segmentation results. Indoor trials were conducted
using 15 potted Hibiscus rosa sinensis plants of varying canopy sizes to
simulate a range of weed patch scenarios. The YOLO11n model achieved a mean
average precision (mAP@50) of 0.98, with a precision of 0.99 and a recall close
to 1.0. The YOLO11n-seg segmentation model achieved a mAP@50 of 0.48, precision
of 0.55, and recall of 0.52. System performance was validated using water
sensitive paper, which showed an average spray coverage of 24.22% in zones
where canopy was present. An upward trend in mean spray coverage from 16.22%
for small canopies to 21.46% and 21.65% for medium and large canopies,
respectively, demonstrated the system's capability to adjust spray output based
on canopy size in real time. These results highlight the potential of combining
real time deep learning with low-cost embedded hardware for selective herbicide
application. Future work will focus on expanding the detection capabilities to
include three common weed species in South Dakota: water hemp (Amaranthus
tuberculatus), kochia (Bassia scoparia), and foxtail (Setaria spp.), followed
by further validation in both indoor and field trials within soybean and corn
production systems.

Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions,
particularly across Africa's diverse urban, rural, and unpaved roads, remains a
key obstacle to robust perception in low-resource settings. We present a
procedural augmentation pipeline that enhances low-cost monocular dashcam
footage with realistic refractive distortions and weather-induced artifacts
tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module
simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including
lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free
(incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous
fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance
using three image restoration models. To support perception research in
underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or
simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and
benchmark results.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers
from Naturalistic driving videos and large vision models. In recent times,
cognitive decline, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly
nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior
captured through in-vehicle systems, this research aims to extract "digital
fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of
MCI and AD. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights
from everyday driving patterns of older patients to early detect cognitive
decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic
driving videos to analyze driver behavior, classify cognitive status and
predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between
real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status
of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our
method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to
proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and
supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to
mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the
aging population.

Conclusion: ReLayout通过关系链式思维和布局原型再平衡，显著提升了布局生成的结构性和多样性，更贴近设计概念。

Abstract: Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given
canvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has
been to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts
automatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based
methods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes
and design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout
generation. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that
leverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent
layouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we
enhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such
as region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing
the layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling
the generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined
relationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines
layout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct
layout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that
arise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive
experimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can
generate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human
aesthetics and more explainable.

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality
(VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground
truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images
from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations
in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full
observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on
analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer
from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their
personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome)
for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale
datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In
this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC),
that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect,
to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning
avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly
disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and
viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth.
Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the
reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both
evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these
new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and
state-of-the-art accuracy.

state of the art performance, scoring NDCG@5 91.0 on ViDoRe V1 and 63.5 on
ViDoRe V2, placing first on both leaderboards as of June 27, 2025.
  Our approach leverages the NVIDIA Eagle2 Vision-Language model (VLM),
modifies its architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional
attention, and integrates a ColBERT-style late interaction mechanism to enable
fine-grained multimodal retrieval in a shared embedding space. While this
mechanism delivers superior retrieval accuracy, it introduces trade-offs in
storage and efficiency. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these
trade-offs. Additionally, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the
model's retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

Abstract: Hyperspectral images are high-dimensional datasets consisting of hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling detailed material and surface analysis.
Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) refers to the technique of identifying
and locating anomalous targets in such data without prior information about a
hyperspectral scene or target spectrum. This technology has seen rapid
advancements in recent years, with applications in agriculture, defence,
military surveillance, and environmental monitoring. Despite this significant

various HAD techniques, categorising them into statistical models,
representation-based methods, classical machine learning approaches, and deep
learning models. We evaluated these methods across 17 benchmarking datasets

analyse detection accuracy, computational efficiency, their strengths,
limitations, and directions for future research.The research shows that deep
learning models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while statistical
models demonstrated exceptional speed across all datasets. This study aims to
provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working to advance
the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

Abstract: The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).

Conclusion: 太阳高度角作为条件变量为合成数据生成提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，填补了白天变化研究的空白。

Abstract: The development of safe and robust autonomous driving functions is heavily
dependent on large-scale, high-quality sensor data. However, real-word data
acquisition demands intensive human labor and is strongly limited by factors
such as labeling cost, driver safety protocols and diverse scenario coverage.
Thus, multiple lines of work focus on the conditional generation of synthetic
camera sensor data. We identify a significant gap in research regarding daytime
variation, presumably caused by the scarcity of available labels. Consequently,
we present the solar altitude as global conditioning variable. It is readily
computable from latitude-longitude coordinates and local time, eliminating the
need for extensive manual labeling. Our work is complemented by a tailored
normalization approach, targeting the sensitivity of daylight towards small
numeric changes in altitude. We demonstrate its ability to accurately capture
lighting characteristics and illumination-dependent image noise in the context
of diffusion models.

Abstract: As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.

Abstract: The development of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) methods for
scene classification problems has attracted great attention in remote sensing
(RS). Most xAI methods and the related evaluation metrics in RS are initially
developed for natural images considered in computer vision (CV), and their
direct usage in RS may not be suitable. To address this issue, in this paper,
we investigate the effectiveness of explanation methods and metrics in the
context of RS image scene classification. In detail, we methodologically and
experimentally analyze ten explanation metrics spanning five categories
(faithfulness, robustness, localization, complexity, randomization), applied to
five established feature attribution methods (Occlusion, LIME, GradCAM, LRP,
and DeepLIFT) across three RS datasets. Our methodological analysis identifies
key limitations in both explanation methods and metrics. The performance of
perturbation-based methods, such as Occlusion and LIME, heavily depends on
perturbation baselines and spatial characteristics of RS scenes. Gradient-based
approaches like GradCAM struggle when multiple labels are present in the same
image, while some relevance propagation methods (LRP) can distribute relevance
disproportionately relative to the spatial extent of classes. Analogously, we
find limitations in evaluation metrics. Faithfulness metrics share the same
problems as perturbation-based methods. Localization metrics and complexity
metrics are unreliable for classes with a large spatial extent. In contrast,
robustness metrics and randomization metrics consistently exhibit greater
stability. Our experimental results support these methodological findings.
Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines for selecting explanation methods,
metrics, and hyperparameters in the context of RS image scene classification.

Motivation: 部分多标签学习的核心挑战在于准确识别标签与实例之间的模糊关系，因此需要一种能够捕捉共现模式的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了语义共现洞察网络（SCINet），包含双主导提示模块、跨模态融合模块和内在语义增强策略，以增强语义对齐并建模标签-实例关系。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的基准数据集上的实验表明，SCINet在性能上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SCINet通过语义共现模式匹配和跨模态融合，为部分多标签学习提供了一种高效且创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning aims to extract knowledge from incompletely
annotated data, which includes known correct labels, known incorrect labels,
and unknown labels. The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the
ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we
emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is
key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic
Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for
partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant
prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture
text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce
instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module
that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and
co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose
an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's
understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image
transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label
confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决GNSS信号缺失区域（如高楼大厦密集区）中LiDAR点云地理配准的挑战。

Method: 使用Point Transformer模型分割道路点，提取道路骨架和交叉点，通过全局刚性和局部RBF插值对齐点云与卫星图像，结合SRTM数据进行高程校正。

Result: 在KITTI和Perth数据集上分别实现了55.3%和77.4%的平面配准精度提升，高程相关性提升30.5%和50.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市复杂环境中表现优异，无需依赖GNSS，展现了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant
challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and
bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that
require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection.
However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in
localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration
and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite
images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of
city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach
employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and
then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as
well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is
performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using
radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied
to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve
vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI
benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the
KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard
deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a
55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks
GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the
GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\%
improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation
correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth
dataset.

Result: 在MEAD数据集上，唇部顶点误差降低56.1%，且保留了网格驱动动画的可控性。

Conclusion: VisualSpeaker在3D面部动画中实现了更高质量和更准确的嘴部动作，适用于手语虚拟人物等场景。

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive
avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior
methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their
ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer
vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this
gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech
recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual
lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting
avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model
during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker
improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual
quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of
mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate
mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign
language avatars.

achieved a minimum loss (3.14e-8) and a validation accuracy (99.41%),
outperforming all other functions tested. These findings demonstrate that
SoftReMish offers better convergence behavior and generalization capability,
making it a promising candidate for visual recognition tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results
on natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to
decipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as "words"
that encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from
natural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar.
Although DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved
high level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do
not encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To
address this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate
sequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as
they underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT
to pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely,
BMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths
along with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and
BMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel
representation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate
that integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological
functions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the
model's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP
imputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we
acknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully
evaluate these models. To enable more comprehensive assessment in the future
and encourage community contributions, we release our models through
HuggingFace and the code to reproduce the results at

Result: 提出的算法在数值实验中表现优异，既高效又精确，并能扩展到更广泛的优化问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为BPDN提供了一种突破性的解决方案，并为其他多面体约束优化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) is a cornerstone of compressive sensing,
statistics and machine learning. While various algorithms for BPDN have been
proposed, they invariably suffer from drawbacks and must either favor
efficiency at the expense of accuracy or vice versa. As such, state-of-the-art
algorithms remain ineffective for high-dimensional applications that require
accurate solutions within a reasonable amount of computational time. In this
work, we address this issue and propose an exact and efficient algorithm for
BPDN using differential inclusions. Specifically, we prove that a selection
principle from the theory of differential inclusions turns the dual problem of
BPDN into calculating the trajectory of an \emph{integrable} projected
dynamical system, that is, whose trajectory and asymptotic limit can be
computed exactly. Our analysis naturally yields an exact algorithm, numerically
up to machine precision, that is amenable to computing regularization paths and
very fast. Numerical experiments confirm that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, we show
that the global continuation of solutions (in terms of the hyperparameter and
data) of the projected dynamical system yields a rigorous homotopy algorithm
for BPDN, as well as a novel greedy algorithm for computing feasible solutions
to basis pursuit in strongly polynomial time. Beyond this work, we expect that
our results and analysis can be adapted to compute exact or approximate
solutions to a broader class of polyhedral-constrained optimization problems.

Conclusion: 零阶方法的固有噪声可能不足以保证隐私，需额外保护措施。

Abstract: Differentially private zeroth-order optimization methods have recently gained
popularity in private fine tuning of machine learning models due to their
reduced memory requirements. Current approaches for privatizing zeroth-order
methods rely on adding Gaussian noise to the estimated zeroth-order gradients.
However, since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently
random, researchers including Tang et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2024a) have
raised an important question: is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators
sufficient to ensure the overall differential privacy of the algorithm? This
work settles this question for a class of oracle-based optimization algorithms
where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient estimates. In particular, we
show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly convex objective
functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD)
is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random
initialization and without revealing (initial and) intermediate iterates, the
privacy loss in ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when
minimizing convex objective functions.

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued
neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a
fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field
theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures
to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued
weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting
hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce
anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through
analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum
state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the
input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the
quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output
layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free
fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation.
The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to
fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional.
It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding
fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications
in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) unleash powerful analysis
capabilities for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Earth observation images in
the data center. However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station
(GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download
challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g.,
disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM
in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground
synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact
LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs
to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and
communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network
and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite
inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission,
separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite

Conclusion: Intra-DP是一种高效、节能的协作推理系统，适用于MEC环境中的DNN推理。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices
presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time
performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources
and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative
inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches
primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant
transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations.
To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance
collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP
employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e.,
operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the
convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into
several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and
transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP
mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient
inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference
latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: 新皮层的异质层次模型对神经科学和人工智能有广泛影响。

Abstract: In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows
up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex
features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of
connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many
anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical
interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond
in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other
evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at
the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more
suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new
interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the
neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains
Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning
system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a
sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2,
can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the
hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional
structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the
theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between
cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these
connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a
heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an
essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel
perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and
artificial intelligence.

### [214] [Exploring LLM Capabilities in Extracting DCAT-Compatible Metadata for Data Cataloging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05282)
*Lennart Busch,Daniel Tebernum,Gissel Velarde*

Key words: 数据探索, 元数据维护, 大型语言模型, DCAT, 自动化

TL;DR: 研究探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化文本数据元数据维护的可能性，结果表明LLMs在语义理解任务上表现接近人类水平。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 随着数据量的指数级增长、异构性和分布性问题，数据消费者在寻找合适数据上浪费了大量时间。手动元数据维护耗时且需要专业知识，因此研究LLMs是否能自动化这一过程。

Method: 通过零样本和少样本提示策略测试了不同供应商的LLMs生成标题和关键词等元数据的能力，并使用微调模型进行分类任务。

Result: LLMs生成的元数据质量接近人类水平，尤其是在需要高级语义理解的任务上。大模型表现优于小模型，微调显著提升分类准确性，少样本提示通常效果更好。

Conclusion: LLMs为元数据创建提供了快速可靠的方法，但成功应用需要仔细考虑任务特定标准和领域上下文。

Abstract: Efficient data exploration is crucial as data becomes increasingly important
for accelerating processes, improving forecasts and developing new business
models. Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable
data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data.
Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to
answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a
manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study
investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data
and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and
few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating
metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for
classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to
human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic
understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning
significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields
better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to
create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of
task-specific criteria and domain context.

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 针对LLMs生成的不实信息具有自我强化、高度可信和多语言快速传播的特点，传统检测方法难以有效应对，因此需要转向主动防御策略。

Method: 提出Three Pillars框架，包括：(1)知识可信性，确保数据完整性；(2)推理可靠性，嵌入自纠正机制；(3)输入鲁棒性，增强模型接口的抗攻击能力。

Result: 通过综合调查和比较分析，主动防御策略在防不实信息方面比传统方法提升63%，但存在计算开销和泛化挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注共同设计健壮的知识基础、推理认证和抗攻击接口，以提升LLMs在多领域的防御能力。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) across critical
domains has amplified the societal risks posed by algorithmically generated
misinformation. Unlike traditional false content, LLM-generated misinformation
can be self-reinforcing, highly plausible, and capable of rapid propagation
across multiple languages, which traditional detection methods fail to mitigate
effectively. This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from
passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a
Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of
training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding
self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness,
enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks.
Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative
meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to
63\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention,
despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges. We
argue that future research should focus on co-designing robust knowledge
foundations, reasoning certification, and attack-resistant interfaces to ensure
LLMs can effectively counter misinformation across varied domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多任务LSTM模型的个性化学习路径推荐方法，通过共享信息和任务特定层优化推荐效果，并在实验中显著优于基线方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 个性化学习需要根据学习者需求动态调整学习路径，深度学习技术为此提供了新的可能性。

Method: 采用多任务LSTM模型，结合共享LSTM层和任务特定层，将学习路径推荐建模为序列到序列预测问题，并引入非重复损失避免冗余推荐。

Result: 在ASSIST09数据集上的实验表明，该模型显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 多任务学习框架能有效提升学习路径推荐的性能，共享信息和任务特定设计的结合是成功关键。

Abstract: Personalized learning is a student-centered educational approach that adapts
content, pace, and assessment to meet each learner's unique needs. As the key
technique to implement the personalized learning, learning path recommendation
sequentially recommends personalized learning items such as lectures and
exercises. Advances in deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning,
have made modeling such recommendations more practical and effective. This
paper proposes a multi-task LSTM model that enhances learning path
recommendation by leveraging shared information across tasks. The approach
reframes learning path recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq)
prediction problem, generating personalized learning paths from a learner's
historical interactions. The model uses a shared LSTM layer to capture common
features for both learning path recommendation and deep knowledge tracing,
along with task-specific LSTM layers for each objective. To avoid redundant
recommendations, a non-repeat loss penalizes repeated items within the
recommended learning path. Experiments on the ASSIST09 dataset show that the
proposed model significantly outperforms baseline methods for the learning path
recommendation.

TL;DR: AI搜索系统的新闻引用模式研究显示，虽然不同提供商的模型引用不同的新闻来源，但其行为模式具有共性，且存在明显的自由派偏向。用户偏好分析表明，新闻来源的政治倾向和质量对用户满意度影响不大。

<details>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 研究AI搜索系统作为信息守门人的角色，填补了对这些系统引用模式的认知空白。

Method: 通过分析AI Search Arena平台的数据集，包括24,000次对话和65,000条响应，以及其中的366,000条引用。

Result: 新闻引用集中在少数媒体且呈现自由派偏向，但低可信度来源引用较少。用户满意度不受新闻来源政治倾向或质量显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI搜索系统的重大挑战，对系统设计和治理有重要意义。

Abstract: AI-powered search systems are emerging as new information gatekeepers,
fundamentally transforming how users access news and information. Despite their
growing influence, the citation patterns of these systems remain poorly
understood. We address this gap by analyzing data from the AI Search Arena, a
head-to-head evaluation platform for AI search systems. The dataset comprises
over 24,000 conversations and 65,000 responses from models across three major
providers: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Among the over 366,000 citations
embedded in these responses, 9% reference news sources. We find that while
models from different providers cite distinct news sources, they exhibit shared
patterns in citation behavior. News citations concentrate heavily among a small
number of outlets and display a pronounced liberal bias, though low-credibility
sources are rarely cited. User preference analysis reveals that neither the
political leaning nor the quality of cited news sources significantly
influences user satisfaction. These findings reveal significant challenges in
current AI search systems and have important implications for their design and
governance.

Abstract: Biomedical semantic question answering rooted in information retrieval can
play a crucial role in keeping up to date with vast, rapidly evolving and
ever-growing biomedical literature. A robust system can help researchers,
healthcare professionals and even layman users access relevant knowledge
grounded in evidence. The BioASQ 2025 Task13b Challenge serves as an important
benchmark, offering a competitive platform for advancement of this space. This
paper presents the methodologies and results from our participation in this
challenge where we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can
answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant PubMed documents and
snippets to generate answers. For the retrieval task, we generated dense
embeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an
ensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for
re-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10
of 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer
generation, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our
system achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean
Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of
0.63 for list questions (rank 5), and ROUGE-SU4 F1 score of 0.29 for ideal
answers (rank 11).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 受自然语言处理（NLP）中提示调整的启发，PLACE旨在通过结构化和可学习的提示令牌增强图节点之间的联系，从而更有效地识别与特定查询相关的结构凝聚性和属性相似性模式。

Method: PLACE集成了可学习的提示令牌到图中，形成提示增强图结构，并通过交替训练范式优化提示参数和GNN。此外，采用分而治之策略提升模型的可扩展性，支持处理百万级规模的图。

Result: 在9个真实世界图上的大量实验表明，PLACE在三种类型的ACS查询中表现优异，平均F1得分比现有最优方法高出22%。

Conclusion: PLACE通过创新的提示学习框架显著提升了社区搜索的效果，并在可扩展性方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose PLACE (Prompt Learning for Attributed Community
Search), an innovative graph prompt learning framework for ACS. Enlightened by
prompt-tuning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where learnable prompt
tokens are inserted to contextualize NLP queries, PLACE integrates structural
and learnable prompt tokens into the graph as a query-dependent refinement
mechanism, forming a prompt-augmented graph. Within this prompt-augmented graph
structure, the learned prompt tokens serve as a bridge that strengthens
connections between graph nodes for the query, enabling the GNN to more
effectively identify patterns of structural cohesiveness and attribute
similarity related to the specific query. We employ an alternating training
paradigm to optimize both the prompt parameters and the GNN jointly. Moreover,
we design a divide-and-conquer strategy to enhance scalability, supporting the
model to handle million-scale graphs. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world
graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of PLACE for three types of ACS queries,
where PLACE achieves higher F1 scores by 22% compared to the state-of-the-arts
on average.

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 观察到高质量嵌入在嵌入空间中占据几何稳定的区域并表现出一致的邻域结构，因此设计此框架。

Method: 结合量化鲁棒性和邻域密度指标预测检索性能，计算开销低。

Result: 在4个标准检索数据集上，Recall@10平均提升9.4±1.2%，计算开销低于检索时间的5%。

Conclusion: 框架能实现自适应检索策略，并为针对性训练数据增强提供见解。

Abstract: Vector retrieval systems exhibit significant performance variance across
queries due to heterogeneous embedding quality. We propose a lightweight
framework for predicting retrieval performance at the query level by combining
quantization robustness and neighborhood density metrics. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that high-quality embeddings occupy geometrically
stable regions in the embedding space and exhibit consistent neighborhood
structures. We evaluate our method on 4 standard retrieval datasets, showing
consistent improvements of 9.4$\pm$1.2\% in Recall@10 over competitive
baselines. The framework requires minimal computational overhead (less than 5\%
of retrieval time) and enables adaptive retrieval strategies. Our analysis
reveals systematic patterns in embedding quality across different query types,
providing insights for targeted training data augmentation.

Method: 提出SASRecLLM框架，集成SASRec作为协同编码器，结合LoRA微调的LLM，并通过映射层和针对性训练策略优化。

Result: 在多数据集上实验显示，SASRecLLM在冷启动和热启动场景下均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SASRecLLM为LLM推荐领域提供了模块化且有效的融合结构化协同过滤和LLM语义能力的新范式。

Abstract: Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation (SASRec) effectively captures
long-term user preferences by applying attention mechanisms to historical
interactions. Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their
powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs
often lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential
for high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To
address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that
integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to
align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are
designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements
over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work
advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and
effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the
semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:

Key words: 生成扩散模型、有限角度CT、快速采样、小波特征融合

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种嵌入先验信息和融合小波特征的快速采样扩散模型（PWD），用于解决有限角度计算机断层扫描（LACT）中标准扩散模型采样步骤多、计算开销大的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 标准扩散模型在LACT中重建质量高，但采样步骤多导致计算成本高。虽然有跳跃采样策略提高效率，但会丢失细节结构。本文旨在提高效率的同时保持重建质量。

Method: PWD在训练阶段将LACT图像分布映射到目标图像分布，学习结构对应关系；在推理阶段，利用LACT图像作为先验指导采样轨迹，减少采样步骤。同时，在小波域进行多尺度特征融合，增强细节重建。

Result: 临床牙科CBCT和根尖周数据集上，PWD在相同采样条件下优于现有方法，仅用50步采样即实现PSNR提高至少1.7 dB，SSIM提高10%。

Conclusion: PWD通过嵌入先验和融合小波特征，在LACT中高效且高质量地完成图像重建，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have received increasing attention in medical
imaging, particularly in limited-angle computed tomography (LACT). Standard
diffusion models achieve high-quality image reconstruction but require a large
number of sampling steps during inference, resulting in substantial
computational overhead. Although skip-sampling strategies have been proposed to
improve efficiency, they often lead to loss of fine structural details. To
address this issue, we propose a prior information embedding and wavelet
feature fusion fast sampling diffusion model for LACT reconstruction. The PWD
enables efficient sampling while preserving reconstruction fidelity in LACT,
and effectively mitigates the degradation typically introduced by
skip-sampling. Specifically, during the training phase, PWD maps the
distribution of LACT images to that of fully sampled target images, enabling
the model to learn structural correspondences between them. During inference,
the LACT image serves as an explicit prior to guide the sampling trajectory,
allowing for high-quality reconstruction with significantly fewer steps. In
addition, PWD performs multi-scale feature fusion in the wavelet domain,
effectively enhancing the reconstruction of fine details by leveraging both
low-frequency and high-frequency information. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations on clinical dental arch CBCT and periapical datasets demonstrate
that PWD outperforms existing methods under the same sampling condition. Using
only 50 sampling steps, PWD achieves at least 1.7 dB improvement in PSNR and
10% gain in SSIM.

Conclusion: ADPv2是一个有价值的公开数据集，支持特定器官的深入研究，并为生物标志物的发现提供了潜力。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CoPath) leverages histopathology images to enhance
diagnostic precision and reproducibility in clinical pathology. However,
publicly available datasets for CoPath that are annotated with extensive
histological tissue type (HTT) taxonomies at a granular level remain scarce due
to the significant expertise and high annotation costs required. Existing
datasets, such as the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP), address this by
offering diverse HTT annotations generalized to multiple organs, but limit the
capability for in-depth studies on specific organ diseases. Building upon this
foundation, we introduce ADPv2, a novel dataset focused on gastrointestinal
histopathology. Our dataset comprises 20,004 image patches derived from healthy
colon biopsy slides, annotated according to a hierarchical taxonomy of 32
distinct HTTs of 3 levels. Furthermore, we train a multilabel representation
learning model following a two-stage training procedure on our ADPv2 dataset.
We leverage the VMamba architecture and achieving a mean average precision
(mAP) of 0.88 in multilabel classification of colon HTTs. Finally, we show that
our dataset is capable of an organ-specific in-depth study for potential
biomarker discovery by analyzing the model's prediction behavior on tissues
affected by different colon diseases, which reveals statistical patterns that
confirm the two pathological pathways of colon cancer development. Our dataset
is publicly available here: Part 1 at https://zenodo.org/records/15307021, Part

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 由于儿科与成人的解剖和发育差异，直接使用成人数据训练的模型在儿科数据上表现不佳，因此需要优化分割策略。

Method: 提出了PSAT方法，从四个方面（指纹数据集、学习集、数据增强、迁移学习方法）研究其对分割性能的影响，并在儿科CT数据上进行测试。

Conclusion: PSAT为儿科影像分割提供了实用优化策略，强调了迁移学习的重要性。

Abstract: Pediatric medical imaging presents unique challenges due to significant
anatomical and developmental differences compared to adults. Direct application
of segmentation models trained on adult data often yields suboptimal
performance, particularly for small or rapidly evolving structures. To address
these challenges, several strategies leveraging the nnU-Net framework have been
proposed, differing along four key axes: (i) the fingerprint dataset (adult,
pediatric, or a combination thereof) from which the Training Plan -including
the network architecture-is derived; (ii) the Learning Set (adult, pediatric,
or mixed), (iii) Data Augmentation parameters, and (iv) the Transfer learning
method (finetuning versus continual learning). In this work, we introduce PSAT
(Pediatric Segmentation Approaches via Adult Augmentations and Transfer
learning), a systematic study that investigates the impact of these axes on
segmentation performance. We benchmark the derived strategies on two pediatric
CT datasets and compare them with state-of-theart methods, including a
commercial radiotherapy solution. PSAT highlights key pitfalls and provides
actionable insights for improving pediatric segmentation. Our experiments
reveal that a training plan based on an adult fingerprint dataset is misaligned
with pediatric anatomy-resulting in significant performance degradation,

Key words: 医疗图像分割,人-AI协作,偏好学习,标注效率,基础模型

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 医疗图像手动标注费时费力，阻碍AI系统开发与应用，需高效解决方案。

Method: 结合偏好学习范式，利用人类专家对AI分割结果的简单反馈（更好或更差），集成基础模型、标签传播、点击代理和多轮分割学习。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证，仅需二元偏好反馈即可实现竞争性分割性能，无需专家直接标注。

Conclusion: 该框架显著降低标注成本，为医疗AI系统开发提供高效工具。

Abstract: Manual annotation of medical images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming
process, posing a significant bottleneck in the development and deployment of
robust medical imaging AI systems. This paper introduces a novel Human-AI
collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially
reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual
pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning
paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply
indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a
previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable
foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on
feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse
feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round
segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation
network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label
propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary
preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate
the images.

Key words: CBCT, 合成CT生成, 多模态学习, 配准, 医学影像

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过多模态学习结合术中CBCT和术前CT数据来改进合成CT生成的方法，并通过引入可学习的配准模块处理模态间的固有不对齐问题，实验证明了其在合成CT质量上的提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: CBCT因其快速采集和低辐射剂量而广泛应用于术中成像，但其图像质量较低且存在伪影，合成CT（sCT）生成是一种潜在解决方案。然而，CBCT与CT之间的固有不对齐问题阻碍了多模态学习的有效性。

Method: 本文提出了一种端到端可学习的配准模块，嵌入到sCT生成流程中，用于处理CBCT与CT之间的不对齐问题。方法在合成数据集上进行了验证，并进一步在真实临床数据集上测试了其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合配准的多模态sCT生成方法在90种评估场景中的79种优于基线方法，尤其是在CBCT质量低且术前CT中度不对齐的情况下效果最显著。

Conclusion: 通过引入配准模块，多模态sCT生成方法能够有效提升合成CT的质量，尤其是在低质量CBCT和中度不对齐情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used for intraoperative
imaging due to its rapid acquisition and low radiation dose. However, CBCT
images typically suffer from artifacts and lower visual quality compared to
conventional Computed Tomography (CT). A promising solution is synthetic CT
(sCT) generation, where CBCT volumes are translated into the CT domain. In this
work, we enhance sCT generation through multimodal learning by jointly
leveraging intraoperative CBCT and preoperative CT data. To overcome the
inherent misalignment between modalities, we introduce an end-to-end learnable
registration module within the sCT pipeline. This model is evaluated on a
controlled synthetic dataset, allowing precise manipulation of data quality and
alignment parameters. Further, we validate its robustness and generalizability
on two real-world clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
integrating registration in multimodal sCT generation improves sCT quality,
outperforming baseline multimodal methods in 79 out of 90 evaluation settings.
Notably, the improvement is most significant in cases where CBCT quality is low
and the preoperative CT is moderately misaligned.

Key words: LDCT, 语义引导, 视觉语言模型, Mamba, 图像去噪

TL;DR: 论文提出LangMamba框架，结合视觉语言模型（VLM）增强低剂量CT（LDCT）去噪，通过语义引导提升图像质量。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: LDCT在降低辐射的同时图像质量下降，现有深度学习方法忽略了高层语义信息，而语言模型可提供结构化语义指导。

Method: 两阶段学习：1) 预训练语言引导自编码器（LangAE）；2)结合SEED模块和LangDA损失进行语义对齐去噪。

Result: LangMamba在公共数据集上表现优于现有方法，提升细节保留和视觉保真度，并展示良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 语言作为监督信号能显著提升LDCT去噪效果，LangMamba为图像重建提供新思路。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but often
degrades image quality, potentially compromising diagnostic accuracy. Existing
deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings,
overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent
advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a
powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new
opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce
LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages
VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT).
LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a
Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT
images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we
synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising:
Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local
semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and
Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that
denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba
outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving
detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong
generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs.
Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided
insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our
findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to
advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on
https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.

Key words: QoS预测,联邦图神经网络,隐私保护,高阶协作,轻量级聚合

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种高阶协作导向的联邦图神经网络（HC-FGNN），用于在保护隐私的同时实现准确的QoS预测。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.DC

Motivation: 现有基于联邦图神经网络的QoS预测方法未能充分利用隐式用户交互，且隐私保护需求迫切。

Method: HC-FGNN通过注意力机制扩展显式用户-服务图以捕捉高阶协作，并采用轻量级消息聚合提高效率。

Result: 在两个真实QoS数据集上的实验表明，HC-FGNN在预测准确性和隐私保护方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: HC-FGNN是一种高效且隐私保护的QoS预测方法。

Abstract: Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) data crucial for cloud service selection,
where user privacy is a critical concern. Federated Graph Neural Networks
(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.
However, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device
training on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize
the implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes
a high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to
obtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it
magnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention
mechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit
user-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message
aggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive
experiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the
proposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and
privacy protection.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a compelling methodology for the
management of distributed data, marked by significant advancements in recent
years. In this paper, we propose an efficient FL approach that capitalizes on
additional downlink bandwidth resources to ensure timely update dissemination.
Initially, we implement this strategy within an asynchronous framework,
introducing the Asynchronous Staleness-aware Model Update (FedASMU), which
integrates both server-side and device-side methodologies. On the server side,
we present an asynchronous FL system model that employs a dynamic model
aggregation technique, which harmonizes local model updates with the global
model to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. Concurrently, on the device
side, we propose an adaptive model adjustment mechanism that integrates the
latest global model with local models during training to further elevate
accuracy. Subsequently, we extend this approach to a synchronous context,
referred to as FedSSMU. Theoretical analyses substantiate the convergence of
our proposed methodologies. Extensive experiments, encompassing six models and
five public datasets, demonstrate that FedASMU and FedSSMU significantly
surpass baseline methods in terms of both accuracy (up to 145.87%) and
efficiency (up to 97.59%).

Result: 在GraspNet-1B数据集和真实机器人实验中，表现优于FedAvg等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡通信成本与模型性能，适用于去中心化环境。

Abstract: Grasp pose detection (GPD) is a fundamental capability for robotic autonomy,
but its reliance on large, diverse datasets creates significant data privacy
and centralization challenges. Federated Learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution, but its application to GPD is hindered by the
substantial communication overhead of large models, a key issue for
resource-constrained robots. To address this, we propose a novel module-wise FL
framework that begins by analyzing the learning dynamics of the GPD model's
functional components. This analysis identifies slower-converging modules, to
which our framework then allocates additional communication effort. This is
realized through a two-phase process: a standard full-model training phase is
followed by a communication-efficient phase where only the identified subset of
slower-converging modules is trained and their partial updates are aggregated.
Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1B dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms standard FedAvg and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy for
a given communication budget. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a physical
robot validate our approach, showing a superior grasp success rate compared to
baseline methods in cluttered scenes. Our work presents a
communication-efficient framework for training robust, generalized GPD models
in a decentralized manner, effectively improving the trade-off between
communication cost and model performance.

Conclusion: 实时语音工作负荷估计对开发自适应人机系统至关重要。

Abstract: Demanding task environments (e.g., supervising a remotely piloted aircraft)
require performing tasks quickly and accurately; however, periods of low and
high operator workload can decrease task performance. Intelligent modulation of
the system's demands and interaction modality in response to changes in
operator workload state may increase performance by avoiding undesirable
workload states. This system requires real-time estimation of each workload
component (i.e., cognitive, physical, visual, speech, and auditory) to adapt
the correct modality. Existing workload systems estimate multiple workload
components post-hoc, but few estimate speech workload, or function in
real-time. An algorithm to estimate speech workload and mitigate undesirable
workload states in real-time is presented. An analysis of the algorithm's
accuracy is presented, along with the results demonstrating the algorithm's
generalizability across individuals and human-machine teaming paradigms.
Real-time speech workload estimation is a crucial element towards developing
adaptive human-machine systems.

Abstract: A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic

decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in unstructured environments, such as forests
and mountainous regions, presents significant challenges due to irregular
terrain and complex road conditions. This work provides a comparative
evaluation of mainstream and well-established path planning algorithms applied
to weighted pixel-level road networks derived from high-resolution satellite
imagery and airborne LiDAR data. For 2D road-map navigation, where the weights
reflect road conditions and terrain difficulty, A*, Dijkstra, RRT*, and a Novel
Improved Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (NIACO) are tested on the DeepGlobe
satellite dataset. For 3D road-map path planning, 3D A*, 3D Dijkstra,
RRT-Connect, and NIACO are evaluated using the Hamilton airborne LiDAR dataset,
which provides detailed elevation information. All algorithms are assessed
under identical start and end point conditions, focusing on path cost,
computation time, and memory consumption. Results demonstrate that Dijkstra
consistently offers the most stable and efficient performance in both 2D and 3D
scenarios, particularly when operating on dense, pixel-level geospatial
road-maps. These findings highlight the reliability of Dijkstra-based planning
for static terrain navigation and establish a foundation for future research on

Abstract: Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of
effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently
understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in
robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do),
embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the
conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive
experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity
proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer
from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2)
multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment
transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently
transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during
fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity,
arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in
human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity
multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we
propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the
yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to
using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new
perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation
datasets effectively.

Abstract: A novel algorithm is presented for the estimation of collision probabilities

of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold
6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the
collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior
work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability.
Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world
scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs,
where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased
interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data.
However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits
target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable
for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations
due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast
teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless,
low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on
accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear
terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain
corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by
4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into
both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation
learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for
high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

Abstract: Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示AI系统集成到军事决策（如使用武力决策）中时，整合者作为中介群体所面临的技术、角色和人机交互挑战。

Method: 通过三个步骤：将AI系统与不同行动者的关系概念化为社会技术系统；识别RTF决策中人机协作的挑战；提出政策建议以解决这些不足。

Result: 研究指出了来自技术、整合者角色和人机交互的挑战，并提出了相应的政策建议。

Conclusion: 整合者在AI系统集成中扮演关键角色，需解决技术与人际关系中的挑战以确保有效决策。

Abstract: The integration of AI systems into the military domain is changing the way
war-related decisions are made. It binds together three disparate groups of
actors - developers, integrators, users - and creates a relationship between
these groups and the machine, embedded in the (pre-)existing organisational and
system structures. In this article, we focus on the important, but often
neglected, group of integrators within such a sociotechnical system. In complex
human-machine configurations, integrators carry responsibility for linking the
disparate groups of developers and users in the political and military system.
To act as the mediating group requires a deep understanding of the other
groups' activities, perspectives and norms. We thus ask which challenges and
shortcomings emerge from integrating AI systems into resort-to-force (RTF)
decision-making processes, and how to address them. To answer this, we proceed
in three steps. First, we conceptualise the relationship between different
groups of actors and AI systems as a sociotechnical system. Second, we identify
challenges within such systems for human-machine teaming in RTF decisions. We
focus on challenges that arise a) from the technology itself, b) from the
integrators' role in the sociotechnical system, c) from the human-machine
interaction. Third, we provide policy recommendations to address these
shortcomings when integrating AI systems into RTF decision-making structures.

Key words: 人机交互（HITL），法律责任，技术可解释性，预言机，法律框架

TL;DR: 论文探讨了不同人机交互（HITL）设置的法律合规性与安全性差异，提出了选择这些设置的新方法，并揭示了法律责任归属与技术可解释性之间不可避免的权衡。通过理论框架和分类法，分析了HITL设置的局限性及法律框架中的疏漏。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 研究动机在于识别并解决HITL设置在法律、伦理和技术上的挑战，避免人类成为替代责任的“替罪羊”。

Method: 采用可计算性理论中的“预言机”概念，形式化区分了不同HITL设置（如简单监控、单点人机交互、深度互动），并提出了一种分类法来系统化HITL的失败模式。

Result: 研究发现现有法律框架（如英国和欧盟）未能充分覆盖HITL设置的多样性，并指出了设计决策中的常见问题。

Conclusion: 结论表明，HITL设计需要综合考虑技术、法律和伦理因素，为开发者和立法者提供了新的分析视角。

Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups
for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing
between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between
the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI.
We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to
formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human
monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction
between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one
reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL
failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL
setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and
EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always
achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest
areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups
and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and
unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve
many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often
out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the
challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers
and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 随着AI和自主算法系统的广泛应用，其交互可能引发系统性风险，而现有治理框架缺乏对这些复杂交互的可见性，亟需新的治理方法。

Method: 论文通过分析算法交互的风险，提出了分阶段的系统注册、部署许可框架和增强监控能力的政策建议。

Result: 研究揭示了算法交互可能导致的严重后果（如市场崩溃、能源供应中断等），并指出当前治理框架的不足。

Conclusion: 需要通过提高透明度和问责制的政策来应对算法交互带来的系统性风险，具体建议包括系统注册和部署许可等。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system
registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring
capabilities.

Conclusion: FSA在模拟医学教育中具有潜力，未来需实证评估。

Abstract: Assisting medical students with clinical reasoning (CR) during clinical
scenario training remains a persistent challenge in medical education. This
paper presents the design and architecture of the Fuzzy Supervisor Agent (FSA),
a novel component for the Multi-Agent Educational Clinical Scenario Simulation
(MAECSS) platform. The FSA leverages a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) to
continuously interpret student interactions with specialized clinical agents
(e.g., patient, physical exam, diagnostic, intervention) using pre-defined
fuzzy rule bases for professionalism, medical relevance, ethical behavior, and
contextual distraction. By analyzing student decision-making processes in
real-time, the FSA is designed to deliver adaptive, context-aware feedback and
provides assistance precisely when students encounter difficulties. This work
focuses on the technical framework and rationale of the FSA, highlighting its
potential to provide scalable, flexible, and human-like supervision in
simulation-based medical education. Future work will include empirical
evaluation and integration into broader educational settings. More detailed

Motivation: 评估匈牙利国家AI战略的实施效果，发现其问题并提出改进建议。

Method: 分析战略文件、公开财务记录及专家访谈，从概念、治理、时间和财务维度评估22个目标，并与新加坡国家AI战略对比。

Result: 匈牙利AI公共投资总额约46.5亿欧元，但仅半数目标有公开财务数据，且三项项目占98%资金。执行分散，缺乏定期审查。

Conclusion: 建议借鉴新加坡框架，适应大语言模型时代，重构产学研网络，成为东西方汽车AI实验桥梁。

Abstract: The study assesses Hungary's National AI Strategy and its implementation
through the analysis of strategic documents, publicly available financial
records, and expert interviews with the Hungarian AI Coalition President and
Chief Strategic Advisor to the Government Commissioner for AI. 22 goals from
Hungary's strategy were evaluated through conceptual, governance, temporal, and
financial dimensions before being benchmarked against Singapore's National AI
Strategies (NAIS 1.0 and NAIS 2.0). Key findings include an estimated total of
EUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available
financial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three
projects made up 98\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals
Hungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following
ministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews
since 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for
Hungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a
reference point. These include adapting to the era of large language models,
restructuring the existing triple helix network to foster more effective
dialogue and advocacy, and positioning the country as an East-West bridge for
automotive AI experimentation.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 探索生成式AI在BIM合规任务中的应用，填补研究空白。

Method: 通过讲座和作业让学生使用LLM检查设计中的代码违规，通过调查和NASA-TLX量表评估效果。

Result: 学生达成学习目标，但面临调试AI代码和工具性能问题，增加了认知压力。

Conclusion: 尽管有挑战，学生对未来AI应用兴趣浓厚，需明确教学支持。

Abstract: This study evaluates the implementation of a Generative AI-powered rule
checking workflow within a graduate-level Building Information Modeling (BIM)
course at a U.S. university. Over two semesters, 55 students participated in a
classroom-based pilot exploring the use of GenAI for BIM compliance tasks, an
area with limited prior research. The instructional design included lectures on
prompt engineering and AI-driven rule checking, followed by an assignment where
students used a large language model (LLM) to identify code violations in
designs using Autodesk Revit. Surveys and interviews were conducted to assess
student workload, learning effectiveness, and overall experience, using the
NASA-TLX scale and regression analysis. Findings indicate students generally
achieved learning objectives but faced challenges such as difficulties
debugging AI-generated code and inconsistent tool performance, probably due to
their limited prompt engineering experience. These issues increased cognitive
and emotional strain, especially among students with minimal programming
backgrounds. Despite these challenges, students expressed strong interest in
future GenAI applications, particularly with clear instructional support.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 大型语言模型（如ChatGPT和Gemini）因计算规模、成本高及过度辅助问题，不适合广泛教育应用，需要更可行的替代方案。

Method: 使用40,000个C编译器错误数据集对三个开源模型（Qwen3-4B、Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen3-32B）进行SFT，结合专家评审和自动化LLM评估。

Result: SFT显著提升小型模型的教学质量，达到与大型模型相当的性能，验证了小型模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 在高质量领域数据上微调高效小型模型是创建教育工具的有效策略，并提供了可复用的推广方法。

Abstract: Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher
cryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale,
cost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread
pedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language
models, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable
alternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C
compiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)
student-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three
open-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual
evaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated
analysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our
results show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller
models, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the
trade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,
efficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for
creating specialised models to drive educational tools. We provide a replicable
methodology to foster broader access to generative AI capabilities in
educational contexts.

Main category: cs.CY

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型(VLMs)的方法难以处理复杂教育任务（如编程任务），需结合结构化推理和明确评估标准。

Method: 提出AGACCI多智能体系统，将评估角色分配给专门化的协作智能体。实验使用360份研究生代码作业及专家标注数据。

Result: AGACCI在评分标准、反馈准确性、相关性、一致性和连贯性上优于单一GPT基准方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体系统在可扩展和情境感知的教育评估中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-assisted education have encouraged the integration of
vision-language models (VLMs) into academic assessment, particularly for tasks
that require both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, existing
VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as
programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that
require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation
criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes
specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy,
interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the
framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60
participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and
qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms
a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy,
relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional
intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies
across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for
scalable and context-aware educational evaluation.

Result: 发现隐藏提示主要为自利性操纵，出版商政策不一致，暴露了学术自动化系统的系统性漏洞。

Conclusion: 需要协调的技术筛查和政策统一，以应对学术评估中生成AI的滥用问题。

Abstract: In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were
found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate
AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as "GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY"
were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses
varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the
practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes
this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique
of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of
hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed
evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect
reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently
self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.
Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer
review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure
requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond
peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including
plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need
for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized
policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow daily, more exciting (and
somewhat controversial) technology emerges every other day. As we see the
advancements in AI, we see more and more people becoming skeptical of it. This
paper explores the complications and confusion around the ethics of generative
AI art. We delve deep into the ethical side of AI, specifically generative art.
We step back from the excitement and observe the impossible conundrums that
this impressive technology produces. Covering environmental consequences,
celebrity representation, intellectual property, deep fakes, and artist
displacement. Our research found that generative AI art is responsible for
increased carbon emissions, spreading misinformation, copyright infringement,
unlawful depiction, and job displacement. In light of this, we propose multiple
possible solutions for these problems. We address each situation's history,
cause, and consequences and offer different viewpoints. At the root of it all,
though, the central theme is that generative AI Art needs to be correctly
legislated and regulated.

Abstract: Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing
skew and handling PVT variations, but analyzing them is difficult due to
reconvergent paths, multi-source driving, and input mesh buffer skew. SPICE
simulations are accurate but slow; yet simplified models miss key effects like
slew and input skew. We propose GATMesh, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
framework that models the clock mesh as a graph with augmented structural and
physical features. Trained on SPICE data, GATMesh achieves high accuracy with
average delay error of 5.27ps on unseen benchmarks, while achieving speed-ups
of 47146x over multi-threaded SPICE simulation.

Conclusion: PrefixAgent为前缀加法器优化提供了高效、可扩展的新方法。

Abstract: Prefix adders are fundamental arithmetic circuits, but their design space
grows exponentially with bit-width, posing significant optimization challenges.
Previous works face limitations in performance, generalization, and
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose PrefixAgent, a large
language model (LLM)-powered framework that enables efficient prefix adder
optimization. Specifically, PrefixAgent reformulates the problem into subtasks
including backbone synthesis and structure refinement, which effectively
reduces the search space. More importantly, this new design perspective enables
us to efficiently collect enormous high-quality data and reasoning traces with
E-graph, which further results in an effective fine-tuning of LLM. Experimental
results show that PrefixAgent synthesizes prefix adders with consistently
smaller areas compared to baseline methods, while maintaining scalability and
generalization in commercial EDA flows.

Motivation: 为提供计算高效的HRRR模型替代方案，利用机器学习技术构建数据驱动的模拟器HRRRCast。

Method: HRRRCast包含ResNet和GNN两种架构，ResHRRR采用卷积神经网络增强及概率预测技术，支持多时次预测。

Result: ResHRRR在20 dBZ阈值下优于HRRR，30 dBZ阈值下表现竞争力，且集合预报保持更锐的空间细节。

Conclusion: HRRRCast是高效数据驱动天气预测的重要进展，未来GraphHRRR有潜力改进。

Abstract: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model is a convection-allowing model
used in operational weather forecasting across the contiguous United States
(CONUS). To provide a computationally efficient alternative, we introduce
HRRRCast, a data-driven emulator built with advanced machine learning
techniques. HRRRCast includes two architectures: a ResNet-based model (ResHRRR)
and a Graph Neural Network-based model (GraphHRRR). ResHRRR uses convolutional
neural networks enhanced with squeeze-and-excitation blocks and Feature-wise
Linear Modulation, and supports probabilistic forecasting via the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). To better handle longer lead times, we train a
single model to predict multiple lead times (1h, 3h, and 6h), then use a greedy
rollout strategy during inference. When evaluated on composite reflectivity
over the full CONUS domain using ensembles of 3 to 10 members, ResHRRR
outperforms HRRR forecast at light rainfall threshold (20 dBZ) and achieves
competitive performance at moderate thresholds (30 dBZ). Our work advances the
StormCast model of Pathak et al. [21] by: a) training on the full CONUS domain,
b) using multiple lead times to improve long-range skill, c) training on
analysis data instead of the +1h post-analysis data inadvertently used in
StormCast, and d) incorporating future GFS states as inputs, enabling
downscaling that improves long-lead accuracy. Grid-, neighborhood-, and
object-based metrics confirm better storm placement, lower frequency bias, and
higher success ratios than HRRR. HRRRCast ensemble forecasts also maintain
sharper spatial detail, with power spectra more closely matching HRRR analysis.
While GraphHRRR underperforms in its current form, it lays groundwork for
future graph-based forecasting. HRRRCast represents a step toward efficient,
data-driven regional weather prediction with competitive accuracy and ensemble
capability.

Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex
geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like
images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a
solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing
methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their
ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we
introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework
that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and
local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that
convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point
clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the
reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our
architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate
global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and
fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset
containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of
reconstruction accuracy.

Key words: 3D高斯泼溅, 新视角合成, 手持设备, 室内场景, 几何先验

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在室内场景实现了实时高保真新视角合成（NVS），但依赖精准图像采集。本文提出LighthouseGS框架，利用手持设备（如手机）的旋转运动，通过几何先验和平面结构优化，解决了姿态估计和3D点重建的挑战。

Main category: cs.GR

Motivation: 解决基于手持设备的旋转运动中相机姿态估计和3D点重建的困难，特别是在纹理稀疏的室内场景，提高3DGS的可访问性和实用性。

Method: 提出LighthouseGS框架，结合移动设备相机姿态和单目深度估计的几何先验，利用室内平面结构，通过平面支架组装初始化3D点，并采用稳定剪枝策略优化几何和光照。

Result: 在真实和合成的室内场景测试中，LighthouseGS实现了超越现有技术的真实感渲染，展示了全景视图合成和物体放置的潜力。

Conclusion: LighthouseGS通过几何和光照优化，成功解决了手持设备旋转运动中的挑战，为3DGS的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel
view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However,
achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images
covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to
develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion
with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this
rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D
point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To
address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired
by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS
leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and
monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in
indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane
scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures,
followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization
stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to
resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices.
Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers
photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating
the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.

### [258] [CORE: Benchmarking LLMs Code Reasoning Capabilities through Static Analysis Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05269)
*Danning Xie,Mingwei Zheng,Xuwei Liu,Jiannan Wang,Chengpeng Wang,Lin Tan,Xiangyu Zhang*

Key words: 大语言模型, 静态分析, 语义推理, 基准测试, 代码生成

TL;DR: CoRe是一个高质量、人工验证的基准测试，旨在评估大语言模型（LLM）在静态分析任务中的表现，揭示了模型在深层语义理解和多步推理方面的不足。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注端到端结果，忽略了对程序语义推理能力的评估，因此需要开发一个更全面的基准测试。

Method: CoRe包含12,553个任务实例，覆盖数据依赖、控制依赖和信息流，采用语义感知的多样化采样策略。

Result: 评估10个主流LLM后发现，模型在依赖识别上表现良好，但在深层语义和多步推理任务中仍有困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型在复杂控制结构和反向依赖模式中的挑战，为改进LLM的代码推理能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across diverse software
engineering domains, such as code generation, program repair, and vulnerability
detection. These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code
patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program
elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes,
such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models
ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe,
a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on
fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning
data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs
written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning
complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects
targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth.
We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at
identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper
semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative
analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and
backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code
reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: 最弱前提条件（WP）的生成在程序验证和运行时错误检查等领域具有重要应用，传统方法复杂且效率低，需要更高效和自动化的解决方案。

Method: 结合大语言模型（LLMs）和模糊测试，提出模糊引导（FG）机制，通过程序执行反馈优化LLMs生成的候选WP。

Result: 实验证明LLMs能生成可行的WP候选，且FG能显著提升其准确性和实用性。

Conclusion: FG是一种有效的方法，可增强LLMs在生成WP时的表现，为自动程序验证提供了新思路。

Abstract: The weakest precondition (WP) of a program describes the largest set of
initial states from which all terminating executions of the program satisfy a
given postcondition. The generation of WPs is an important task with practical
applications in areas ranging from verification to run-time error checking.
  This paper proposes the combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and fuzz
testing for generating WPs. In pursuit of this goal, we introduce Fuzzing
Guidance (FG); FG acts as a means of directing LLMs towards correct WPs using
program execution feedback. FG utilises fuzz testing for approximately checking
the validity and weakness of candidate WPs, this information is then fed back
to the LLM as a means of context refinement.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive benchmark
set of deterministic array programs in Java. Our experiments indicate that LLMs
are capable of producing viable candidate WPs, and that this ability can be
practically enhanced through FG.

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: 现有仓库级基准测试局限于单一场景，未能全面反映真实世界软件的多样性和复杂性，且测试用例的可靠性和可控性不足。

Method: 提出CorePipe，自动将代码仓库转换为综合测试用例，并开发CoreCodeBench基准测试，支持多场景配置，生成不同类型的原子问题及其组合问题。

Result: 在16个LLM上的实验显示，CoreCodeBench能揭示模型在不同工程场景下的多维能力。

Conclusion: CoreCodeBench为研究LLM在真实工程项目中的适用性提供了全面且可扩展的基准。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly sophisticated code
processing capabilities, evaluating their performance on engineering-level code
remains challenging. Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on
single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately
capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project
engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited
controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their
generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a
fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test
cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario
repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe
generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven
Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions
are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty
levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides
a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the
applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16
LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer
multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The
code for CorePipe is available at
https://github.com/AGI-Eval-Official/CoreCodeBench, and the data for
CoreCodeBench can be accessed at

TL;DR: 提出了ASSURE框架，用于自动化测试集成大语言模型的浏览器扩展，解决了传统方法在非确定性行为和复杂环境中的不足。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: LLM集成的浏览器扩展在功能上带来突破，但测试和可靠性保障面临新挑战，现有方法无法有效应对。

Method: ASSURE框架包含模块化测试用例生成引擎、自动化执行框架和可配置验证管道，综合评估行为和安全性。

Result: 在六款流行扩展中识别出531个问题，测试效率提升6.4倍，平均12.4分钟检测到关键漏洞。

Conclusion: ASSURE为LLM浏览器扩展测试提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于开发流程集成。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into browser extensions has
revolutionized web browsing, enabling sophisticated functionalities like
content summarization, intelligent translation, and context-aware writing
assistance. However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented
challenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension
testing approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior,
context-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to
LLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate
in isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in
effective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a
modular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered
browser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular
test case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing
scenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex
interactions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior,
and (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates
behavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact
output matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions
demonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning
security vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content
alignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared
to manual approaches, detecting critical security vulnerabilities within 12.4
minutes on average. This efficiency makes ASSURE practical for integration into
development pipelines, offering a comprehensive solution to the unique
challenges of testing AI-powered browser extensions.

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: 现有的API文档多为非结构化的HTML格式，需手动转换为机器可读格式，耗时且效率低。

Method: 集成大型语言模型和基于规则的算法，结合文档网页结构的领域知识，构建了一个名为OASBuilder的自动化框架。

Result: OASBuilder能有效处理数百种API，生成的OpenAPI规范涵盖原文档大部分信息，已在企业环境中成功应用。

Conclusion: OASBuilder显著提升了API规范的自动化生成效率，节省了手动转换的时间和资源。

Abstract: AI agents and business automation tools interacting with external web
services require standardized, machine-readable information about their APIs in
the form of API specifications. However, the information about APIs available
online is often presented as unstructured, free-form HTML documentation,
requiring external users to spend significant time manually converting it into
a structured format. To address this, we introduce OASBuilder, a novel
framework that transforms long and diverse API documentation pages into
consistent, machine-readable API specifications. This is achieved through a
carefully crafted pipeline that integrates large language models and rule-based
algorithms which are guided by domain knowledge of the structure of
documentation webpages. Our experiments demonstrate that OASBuilder generalizes
well across hundreds of APIs, and produces valid OpenAPI specifications that
encapsulate most of the information from the original documentation. OASBuilder
has been successfully implemented in an enterprise environment, saving
thousands of hours of manual effort and making hundreds of complex enterprise
APIs accessible as tools for LLMs.

Motivation: 现有LLM测试研究多限于自动生成测试用例（MRs）以增强故障检测，且仅考虑单扰动MRs。本文旨在优化MR组选择，提升测试效果并降低计算成本。

Method: 提出搜索方法，实现四种算法（Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, MOEA/D）解决MR选择问题。实验采用两种主流LLM进行对比分析。

Result: MOEA/D在优化MR空间方面表现最佳；发现了银弹MRs，能够混淆不同文本任务中的LLM。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM鲁棒性测试提供了优化方案，并展示了搜索算法的有效性。

Abstract: Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
robustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing
that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate
the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing
still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization
of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically
generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,
most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in
their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based
approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and
minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the
combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in
the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented
four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel
encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We
conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a
random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our
statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the
MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM
robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM
robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs
across different Text-to-Text tasks. In LLM robustness assessment, our research
sheds light on the fundamental problem for optimized testing and provides
insights into search-based solutions.

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 现有的可视化图表重新定向过程复杂且耗时，LLM的高层次提示可能降低这一过程的门槛。

Method: 比较两种方法：直接生成代码与基于程序合成的约束性指导。

Result: 两种方法在新数据未适当转换时表现不佳，提出了未来系统的设计建议。

Conclusion: LLM辅助可视化重新定向有潜力，但需改进数据转换问题。

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of visualization examples published on the web,
retargeting existing custom chart implementations to new datasets remains
difficult, time-intensive, and tedious. The adaptation process assumes author
familiarity with both the implementation of the example as well as how the new
dataset might need to be transformed to fit into the example code. With recent
advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), automatic adaptation of code can be
achieved from high-level user prompts, reducing the barrier for visualization
retargeting. To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its
potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM
assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity,
categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we
compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully
generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more
constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code
construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual
encodings) based on properties of the example code and data. We find that both
approaches struggle when new data has not been appropriately transformed, and
discuss important design recommendations for future retargeting systems.

Motivation: 研究发现，作者在创作长故事时难以想象新角色对现有角色的影响、平衡角色间的异同，以及详细刻画角色关系。为了解决这些问题，设计了Constella工具。

Method: Constella利用多代理LLM技术，提供FRIENDS DISCOVERY（发现关联角色）、JOURNALS（多角色内心展示）和COMMENTS（角色间互动）功能，支持作者的角色创作。

Result: 部署研究（N=11）显示，Constella帮助作者创建了复杂的角色社区，便于比较角色情感，并加深了对角色关系的理解。

Conclusion: 研究表明，多代理交互可以分散作者对角色的注意力，提升角色创作的效率和质量。

Abstract: Creating a cast of characters by attending to their relational dynamics is a
critical aspect of most long-form storywriting. However, our formative study
(N=14) reveals that writers struggle to envision new characters that could
influence existing ones, to balance similarities and differences among
characters, and to intricately flesh out their relationships. Based on these
observations, we designed Constella, an LLM-based multi-agent tool that
supports storywriters' interconnected character creation process. Constella
suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner
mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and
manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature).
Our 7-8 day deployment study with storywriters (N=11) shows that Constella
enabled the creation of expansive communities composed of related characters,
facilitated the comparison of characters' thoughts and emotions, and deepened
writers' understanding of character relationships. We conclude by discussing
how multi-agent interactions can help distribute writers' attention and effort
across the character cast.

Main category: quant-ph

Motivation: 传统硬件高效ansatz在量子计算中容易遇到梯度消失问题（barren plateaus），导致训练困难。通过限制电路演化的对称性，可以缓解这一问题。

Method: SUN-VQC的每一层是$	ext{SU}(2^{k})$（$k ≪ n$）子群的单指数映射，动态李代数维度从$	{O}(4^{n})$降至$	{O}(4^{k})$，并使用广义参数偏移规则计算兼容硬件的精确梯度。

Result: 实验显示，SUN-VQC比传统Pauli旋转或硬件高效电路梯度信号大一个数量级，收敛速度快2--3倍，最终保真度更高。

Conclusion: 李子群工程为解决梯度消失问题提供了可扩展且高效的方案，适用于近期量子处理器。

Abstract: We propose SUN-VQC, a variational-circuit architecture whose elementary
layers are single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup,
$\mathrm{SU}(2^{k}) \subset \mathrm{SU}(2^{n})$ with $k \ll n$. Confining the
evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension
from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial
suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague
hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained
using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and
finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and
classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient
signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than
depth-matched Pauli-rotation or hardware-efficient circuits. These results
demonstrate that Lie-subalgebra engineering provides a principled, scalable
route to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs compatible with near-term quantum
processors.

Motivation: 通过量子电路减少经典计算中近似Laplace算子特征的昂贵计算成本，同时利用其几何结构提升图分类任务的性能。

Method: 设计基于Laplace算子和量子傅里叶变换的参数化量子电路，作为图神经网络的卷积和池化层，后接经典神经网络进行预测。

Result: 在TUDataset基准数据集上，使用少量可学习参数（量子电路1-100，经典层1000-5000），性能与基线相当或更好，尤其在几何结构显著的情况下。

Conclusion: 参数化量子电路在图神经网络中具有高效压缩和性能优势，尤其是在几何结构重要的任务中。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.

Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a
hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a
tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in
trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are
necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled
measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for
a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is
for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal
bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the
tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],
they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements
they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for
quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled
measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal
copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity
times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our
lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,
which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to
recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],
i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple
proof.

Motivation: 解决太阳耀斑长期预测的复杂性，通过分解时间序列减少噪声干扰。

Method: 采用滑动窗口技术和正则化处理，结合LSTM和DLSTM模型，并使用集成算法。

Result: DLSTM在正则化时间序列上的表现优于其他模型，TSS为0.74，AUC为0.87。

Conclusion: DLSTM因能分解趋势和季节性成分，显著提升预测准确性。

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to
predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog.
The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among
approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified,
highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex,
self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is
employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized
flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare
activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class
imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on
sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while
LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding
windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics,
particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)
in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an
ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering
more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models
trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is
attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal
components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the
potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction
and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and
resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized
linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting
actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from
multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on
understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et
al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant
$\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and
which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates
the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from
$\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the
dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial
logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with
more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems.
To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial
setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's
non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $
\smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the
number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing
guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $.
Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound,
showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.

Method: 结合分位数回归和具有衰减学习率的在线共形校准层。

Result: 在多种金融资产（如S&P 500、比特币、黄金）上，TCP表现出比传统方法更精确的预测区间和竞争性覆盖率。

Conclusion: TCP为金融不确定性量化提供了一种无需分布假设、自适应且可解释的替代方案，推动了统计推断与机器学习的结合。

Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a novel framework for
constructing prediction intervals in financial time-series with guaranteed
finite-sample validity. TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal
calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid
design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to
accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which
are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric
assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH,
Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&P
500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show
that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior
coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's
strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in
modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and
interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing
the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful
tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the
score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to
the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a
variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score
matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we
derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad
class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern
stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint
operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type
formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written
entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all
Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its
practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work
offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in
generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for
complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader
classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the
development of score-based diffusion generative models.

Result: 发现可诱发的IP属性实际上是最大Bayes风险分布对应的标准属性。

Conclusion: 结论是不精确概率下的属性可诱发性可以通过Bayes对和最大Bayes风险分布来理解。

Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution
can be determined by minimising a risk. We investigate a generalisation of
property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is
motivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine
learning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and
replaces it with $\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide
necessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we
explain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs --
the elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum
Bayes risk distribution.

Result: 研究表明，平滑能帮助SBoN减轻奖励过优化问题，尤其在代理奖励质量较低时效果显著。

Conclusion: SBoN通过平滑改善了BoN的性能，尤其在代理奖励模型不理想时表现更优。

Abstract: A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative
models is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference
policy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is
selected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL
tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the
proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a
smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical
framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by
providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference
policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of
samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true
reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and
empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward
overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.

Conclusion: 新距离结合了MMD和Wasserstein的优点，并在实验中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many
statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative
modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that
compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We
show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be
framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In
particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more
discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it
benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the
curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to
compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix
for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those
advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under
contamination as well as particle flow simulations.

Conclusion: PQ为流行度估计任务提供了更精确和可靠的量化方法，并深入分析了影响精度的关键因素。

Abstract: Unlike classification, whose goal is to estimate the class of each data point
in a dataset, prevalence estimation or quantification is a task that aims to
estimate the distribution of classes in a dataset. The two main tasks in
prevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the
training dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard
methods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping
and Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in
terms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e.
the confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise
Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing
quantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ
and present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through
these experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification
precision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of
the labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled
dataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights
into uncertainty quantification for quantification learning.

Conclusion: StaB-ddG通过结合迁移学习和丰富的折叠能数据，实现了高准确性和高效率的蛋白质结合能预测。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of mutational effects on protein-protein binding energies
is an open problem with applications in structural biology and therapeutic
design. Several deep learning predictors for this task have been proposed, but,
presumably due to the scarcity of binding data, these methods underperform
computationally expensive estimates based on empirical force fields. In
response, we propose a transfer-learning approach that leverages advances in
protein sequence modeling and folding stability prediction for this task. The
key idea is to parameterize the binding energy as the difference between the
folding energy of the protein complex and the sum of the folding energies of
its binding partners. We show that using a pre-trained inverse-folding model as
a proxy for folding energy provides strong zero-shot performance, and can be
fine-tuned with (1) copious folding energy measurements and (2) more limited
binding energy measurements. The resulting predictor, StaB-ddG, is the first
deep learning predictor to match the accuracy of the state-of-the-art empirical
force-field method FoldX, while offering an over 1,000x speed-up.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结构化简洁的设计，MESNs能够超越传统ESNs的随机复杂性，更有效地学习混沌动态。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is widely used to model chaotic systems. Among ML
approaches, echo state networks (ESNs) have received considerable attention due
to their simple construction and fast training. However, ESN performance is
highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices and to its random initialization. In
this work, we demonstrate that ESNs constructed using deterministic rules and
simple topologies (MESNs) outperform standard ESNs in the task of chaotic
attractor reconstruction. We use a dataset of more than 90 chaotic systems to
benchmark 10 different minimal deterministic reservoir initializations. We find
that MESNs obtain up to a 41% reduction in error compared to standard ESNs.
Furthermore, we show that the MESNs are more robust, exhibiting less inter-run
variation, and have the ability to reuse hyperparameters across different
systems. Our results illustrate how structured simplicity in ESN design can
outperform stochastic complexity in learning chaotic dynamics.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models, such as LLMs, have revolutionized
conversational AI. Chatbots are increasingly being developed by customizing
LLMs on specific conversational datasets. However, mitigating toxicity during
this customization, especially when dealing with untrusted training data,
remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce TuneShield, a
defense framework designed to mitigate toxicity during chatbot fine-tuning
while preserving conversational quality. TuneShield leverages LLM-based
toxicity classification, utilizing the instruction-following capabilities and
safety alignment of LLMs to effectively identify toxic samples, outperforming
industry API services. TuneShield generates synthetic conversation samples,
termed 'healing data', based on the identified toxic samples, using them to
mitigate toxicity while reinforcing desirable behavior during fine-tuning. It
performs an alignment process to further nudge the chatbot towards producing
desired responses. Our findings show that TuneShield effectively mitigates
toxicity injection attacks while preserving conversational quality, even when
the toxicity classifiers are imperfect or biased. TuneShield proves to be
resilient against adaptive adversarial and jailbreak attacks. Additionally,
TuneShield demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adaptive toxicity injection
attacks during dialog-based learning (DBL).

Abstract: Model extraction attacks pose significant security threats to deployed
language models, potentially compromising intellectual property and user
privacy. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific
extraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality
extraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze
various attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct
querying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit
transformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into
model protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies,
evaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We
propose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and
defense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language
models. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current
approaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated
attack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with
model utility. This work serves NLP researchers, ML engineers, and security
professionals seeking to protect language models in production environments.

*Gehao Zhang,Eugene Bagdasarian,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma*

Key words: 代码水印、AI生成代码、代码混淆、鲁棒性、N-gram

TL;DR: 该研究评估了N-gram水印方案在代码混淆攻击下的鲁棒性，证明其在分布一致性假设下无法保持鲁棒性，并提出可能的改进路径。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: AI生成代码与人工代码的区分日益重要，但现有N-gram水印方案的鲁棒性缺乏对复杂代码转换（如混淆）的评估。

Method: 通过建模代码混淆并理论证明N-gram水印的不可鲁棒性，同时实验验证在多种水印方案、语言、基准和混淆器下的表现。

Result: 实验表明所有水印检测器在混淆后的代码上检测能力接近随机（AUROC约0.5），且混淆攻击使AUROC不超过0.6。

Conclusion: N-gram水印方案在代码混淆攻击下不鲁棒，需探索其他路径实现鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distinguishing AI-generated code from human-written code is becoming crucial
for tasks such as authorship attribution, content tracking, and misuse
detection. Based on this, N-gram-based watermarking schemes have emerged as
prominent, which inject secret watermarks to be detected during the generation.
  However, their robustness in code content remains insufficiently evaluated.
Most claims rely solely on defenses against simple code transformations or code
optimizations as a simulation of attack, creating a questionable sense of
robustness. In contrast, more sophisticated schemes already exist in the
software engineering world, e.g., code obfuscation, which significantly alters
code while preserving functionality. Although obfuscation is commonly used to
protect intellectual property or evade software scanners, the robustness of
code watermarking techniques against such transformations remains largely
unexplored.
  In this work, we formally model the code obfuscation and prove the
impossibility of N-gram-based watermarking's robustness with only one intuitive
and experimentally verified assumption, distribution consistency, satisfied.
Given the original false positive rate of the watermarking detection, the ratio
that the detector failed on the watermarked code after obfuscation will
increase to 1 - fpr.
  The experiments have been performed on three SOTA watermarking schemes, two
LLMs, two programming languages, four code benchmarks, and four obfuscators.
Among them, all watermarking detectors show coin-flipping detection abilities
on obfuscated codes (AUROC tightly surrounds 0.5). Among all models,
watermarking schemes, and datasets, both programming languages own obfuscators
that can achieve attack effects with no detection AUROC higher than 0.6 after
the attack. Based on the theoretical and practical observations, we also
proposed a potential path of robust code watermarking.

TL;DR: 该论文从对抗性角度全面评估了数据集审计技术，揭示了现有方法在对抗攻击下的不足。

<details>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 深度学习广泛应用依赖于训练数据集的质量和组成，但数据集使用的透明性问题引发隐私和版权担忧。

Method: 提出新的分类法，将现有方法分为依赖内部特征（IF）和外部特征（EF），并制定了两类攻击：逃避攻击和伪造攻击。

Result: 通过DATABench基准评估，发现现有审计方法在对抗环境下均不够鲁棒或具有区分性。

Conclusion: 亟需开发更安全可靠的数据集审计方法以抵御对抗性操纵。

Abstract: The widespread application of Deep Learning across diverse domains hinges
critically on the quality and composition of training datasets. However, the
common lack of disclosure regarding their usage raises significant privacy and
copyright concerns. Dataset auditing techniques, which aim to determine if a
specific dataset was used to train a given suspicious model, provide promising
solutions to addressing these transparency gaps. While prior work has developed
various auditing methods, their resilience against dedicated adversarial
attacks remains largely unexplored. To bridge the gap, this paper initiates a
comprehensive study evaluating dataset auditing from an adversarial
perspective. We start with introducing a novel taxonomy, classifying existing
methods based on their reliance on internal features (IF) (inherent to the
data) versus external features (EF) (artificially introduced for auditing).
Subsequently, we formulate two primary attack types: evasion attacks, designed
to conceal the use of a dataset, and forgery attacks, intending to falsely
implicate an unused dataset. Building on the understanding of existing methods
and attack objectives, we further propose systematic attack strategies:
decoupling, removal, and detection for evasion; adversarial example-based
methods for forgery. These formulations and strategies lead to our new
benchmark, DATABench, comprising 17 evasion attacks, 5 forgery attacks, and 9
representative auditing methods. Extensive evaluations using DATABench reveal
that none of the evaluated auditing methods are sufficiently robust or
distinctive under adversarial settings. These findings underscore the urgent
need for developing a more secure and reliable dataset auditing method capable
of withstanding sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Code is available at

Motivation: 研究动机在于发现和分析LLM集成应用中的已知答案检测（KAD）防御框架的结构性漏洞，以提高对此类安全威胁的认识。

Method: 通过设计一种称为DataFlip的方法论自适应攻击，利用KAD框架的设计漏洞，无需白盒访问或优化过程即可绕过防御。

Result: 实验结果显示，DataFlip能够将KAD的检测率降低至1.5%，同时成功诱导恶意行为的比率达到88%。

Conclusion: 结论指出KAD防御框架存在根本性弱点，需重新设计以应对此类攻击。

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection
attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly
benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses
based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect
performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In
this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural
vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We
design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this
fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates
as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates
of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any
optimization procedures.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 现有的全同态加密GNN方法因忽视输入数据冗余和统一计算策略导致效率低下，无法实现实时隐私保护推理。

Method: 通过FHE兼容的节点重要性评分和同态划分过程，动态生成多级重要性掩码，结合输入图修剪和自适应多项式激活优化计算。

Result: 实验表明，DESIGN显著加速FHE GNN推理，同时保持模型准确性。

Conclusion: DESIGN为安全图分析提供了一种高效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs
in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE),
typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and
privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN
(EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel
framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical
efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook
input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework
achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization
strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance
scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted
graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating
multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated
mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant
elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation
complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy,
presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics.

TL;DR: A1是一个基于代理执行的系统，能将任何LLM转化为端到端的漏洞利用生成器，通过工具自主发现漏洞并验证输出。在真实世界合约测试中表现优异，但存在攻击者与防御者之间的不对称性。

<details>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 研究如何利用LLM和代理执行技术实现自主漏洞发现，并探讨其在实际应用中对攻击者和防御者的不对称影响。

Method: A1系统提供六种领域专用工具，代理通过工具理解智能合约行为、生成漏洞利用策略、测试并优化。输出经具体验证以消除误报。

Result: 在36个真实世界漏洞合约测试中，成功率为62.96%（17/27），并额外发现9个漏洞。A1在26个成功案例中总计提取933万美元。

Conclusion: A1在漏洞发现中表现优异，但攻击者比防御者更容易从中获益，揭示了AI代理可能更倾向于利用漏洞的潜在问题。

Abstract: We present A1, an agentic execution driven system that transforms any LLM
into an end-to-end exploit generator. A1 has no hand-crafted heuristics and
provides the agent with six domain-specific tools that enable autonomous
vulnerability discovery. The agent can flexibly leverage these tools to
understand smart contract behavior, generate exploit strategies, test them on
blockchain states, and refine approaches based on execution feedback. All
outputs are concretely validated to eliminate false positives.
  The evaluation across 36 real-world vulnerable contracts on Ethereum and
Binance Smart Chain demonstrates a 62.96% (17 out of 27) success rate on the
VERITE benchmark. Beyond the VERITE dataset, A1 identified 9 additional
vulnerable contracts, with 5 cases occurring after the strongest model's
training cutoff date. Across all 26 successful cases, A1 extracts up to 8.59
million USD per case and 9.33 million USD total. Through 432 experiments across
six LLMs, we analyze iteration-wise performance showing diminishing returns
with average marginal gains of +9.7%, +3.7%, +5.1%, and +2.8% for iterations
2-5 respectively, with per-experiment costs ranging $0.01-$3.59. A Monte Carlo
analysis of 19 historical attacks shows success probabilities of 85.9%-88.8%
without detection delays.
  We investigate whether an attacker or a defender benefits most from deploying
A1 as a continuous on-chain scanning system. Our model shows that OpenAI's
o3-pro maintains profitability up to a 30.0 days scanning delay at 0.100%
vulnerability incidence rates, while faster models require >=1.000% rates to
break-even. The findings exposes a troubling asymmetry: at 0.1% vulnerability
rates, attackers achieve an on-chain scanning profitability at a $6000 exploit
value, while defenders require $60000, raising fundamental questions about
whether AI agents inevitably favor exploitation over defense.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 当前漏洞管理方法缺乏对系统设计漏洞状态的系统性支持，因此开发自动化推理机制以弥补这一不足。

Method: 将形式化基础的自动化推理机制集成到开源安全设计工具中，并通过实际案例验证其应用效果。

Result: 该机制可帮助设计师识别适用漏洞、明确缓解选项并选择控制措施，从而系统性管理漏洞状态。

Conclusion: 自动化推理机制为系统化漏洞管理和安全控制设计提供了有效支持。

Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture
and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to
proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security
controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do
not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems
designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we
propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the
mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its
application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges.
The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify
vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly
specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus
systematically manage vulnerability postures.

Conclusion: 结论指出GenAI在安全任务中的潜力，但也指出某些任务因数据特性影响性能提升。

Abstract: Machine learning-based supervised classifiers are widely used for security
tasks, and their improvement has been largely focused on algorithmic
advancements. We argue that data challenges that negatively impact the
performance of these classifiers have received limited attention. We address
the following research question: Can developments in Generative AI (GenAI)
address these data challenges and improve classifier performance? We propose
augmenting training datasets with synthetic data generated using GenAI
techniques to improve classifier generalization. We evaluate this approach
across 7 diverse security tasks using 6 state-of-the-art GenAI methods and
introduce a novel GenAI scheme called Nimai that enables highly controlled data
synthesis. We find that GenAI techniques can significantly improve the
performance of security classifiers, achieving improvements of up to 32.6% even
in severely data-constrained settings (only ~180 training samples).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that GenAI can facilitate rapid adaptation to
concept drift post-deployment, requiring minimal labeling in the adjustment
process. Despite successes, our study finds that some GenAI schemes struggle to
initialize (train and produce data) on certain security tasks. We also identify
characteristics of specific tasks, such as noisy labels, overlapping class
distributions, and sparse feature vectors, which hinder performance boost using
GenAI. We believe that our study will drive the development of future GenAI
tools designed for security tasks.

Motivation: 信息系统的事件日志包含敏感信息，需要在匿名化的同时保留过程发现的效用，但目前匿名化会导致效用损失，尤其是复杂事件日志。

Method: 提出了一种结合匿名化和事件分区的管道，利用事件抽象对日志进行分区，每部分单独匿名化。

Result: 实验使用三种真实事件日志和两种过程发现技术，证明事件分区在直接跟随匿名技术中能提高过程发现的效用。

Conclusion: 事件分区技术能在保护隐私的同时有效提升匿名化日志的过程发现效用。

Abstract: Information systems support the execution of business processes. The event
logs of these executions generally contain sensitive information about
customers, patients, and employees. The corresponding privacy challenges can be
addressed by anonymizing the event logs while still retaining utility for
process discovery. However, trading off utility and privacy is difficult: the
higher the complexity of event log, the higher the loss of utility by
anonymization. In this work, we propose a pipeline that combines anonymization
and event data partitioning, where event abstraction is utilized for
partitioning. By leveraging event abstraction, event logs can be segmented into
multiple parts, allowing each sub-log to be anonymized separately. This
pipeline preserves privacy while mitigating the loss of utility. To validate
our approach, we study the impact of event partitioning on two anonymization
techniques using three real-world event logs and two process discovery
techniques. Our results demonstrate that event partitioning can bring
improvements in process discovery utility for directly-follows-based
anonymization techniques.

Motivation: 探索LLM的安全机制，解决其面对越狱攻击时的脆弱性问题。

Method: 基于LLM中间层嵌入的线性可分性，利用GAN学习其内部安全判断边界。

Result: 在三种流行LLM上平均越狱成功率88.85%，防御成功率84.17%。

Conclusion: 方法验证了有效性，为增强LLM安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the
protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods
reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have
isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection
mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense.
Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate
layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to
embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize
generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary
inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The
experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak
success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success
rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%.
This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light
on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for
enhancing model security The code and data are available at
