Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REAL的强化学习框架，通过程序分析反馈来激励大型语言模型(LLMs)生成高质量代码，无需人工干预，显著提升了代码的功能性和质量。

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码生成方法在代码质量（如安全性和可维护性）上表现不足，现有方案依赖人工标注或启发式规则，难以扩展且效果有限。

Method: REAL框架结合了两种自动化信号：程序分析（检测缺陷）和单元测试（确保功能正确性），无需人工标注或特定提示，实现可扩展的监督。

Result: 实验表明，REAL在多数据集和模型规模下均优于现有方法，同时在功能性和代码质量评估中表现更优。

Conclusion: REAL弥合了快速原型和生产级代码之间的差距，使LLM能在速度和质量上兼得。

Abstract: Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding,
is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality,
particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and
maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive
annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that
incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program
analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals:
(1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit
tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is
prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without
manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales
demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous
assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between
rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both
speed and quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个名为Climate Finance Bench的开放式基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在企业气候披露问答任务中的表现，并通过比较RAG方法指出检索器的性能是关键瓶颈。

Motivation: 动机是解决AI在气候金融领域问答任务的评估问题，并促进透明碳报告和高效技术（如权重量化）的应用。

Method: 方法包括构建一个包含33份可持续发展报告的标注数据集（330个问题-答案对），并比较不同的检索增强生成（RAG）方法。

Result: 结果表明，检索器能否准确定位包含答案的段落是性能的主要瓶颈，同时强调了透明碳报告的重要性。

Conclusion: 结论认为改进检索器性能是关键，并提倡在气候应用中使用高效技术以减少碳足迹。

Abstract: Climate Finance Bench introduces an open benchmark that targets
question-answering over corporate climate disclosures using Large Language
Models. We curate 33 recent sustainability reports in English drawn from
companies across all 11 GICS sectors and annotate 330 expert-validated
question-answer pairs that span pure extraction, numerical reasoning, and
logical reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose a comparison of RAG
(retrieval-augmented generation) approaches. We show that the retriever's
ability to locate passages that actually contain the answer is the chief
performance bottleneck. We further argue for transparent carbon reporting in
AI-for-climate applications, highlighting advantages of techniques such as
Weight Quantization.

### [3] [Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757)

Key words: 多令牌预测, 课程学习, 小语言模型, 自推测解码, 预训练目标

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对小语言模型的多令牌预测（MTP）训练的课程学习策略，包含前向和反向两种课程，实验表明前向课程能提升下游任务表现并保留自推测解码优势，而反向课程虽提升生成质量但无法提供自推测解码增益。

Motivation: 虽然多令牌预测（MTP）在大模型中表现优异，但小语言模型（SLMs）难以有效利用这一目标。为了解决这一问题，研究者提出了课程学习策略，以帮助SLMs更好地适应MTP训练。

Method: 提出了两种课程学习变体：前向课程（从单令牌预测逐步过渡到多令牌预测）和反向课程（反向操作）。通过实验评估这两种策略对小语言模型的影响。

Result: 前向课程能显著提升下游任务的表现和生成质量，同时保留自推测解码的优势；反向课程虽然在生成质量和单令牌预测性能上更强，但无法提供自推测解码的收益。

Conclusion: 课程学习策略（尤其是前向课程）能有效帮助小语言模型从多令牌预测目标中获益，同时保持其高效性。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了FAMA，首个基于开源数据和代码的英语和意大利语语音基础模型，性能与现有模型相当且速度快8倍，所有资源均开源。

Motivation: 现有语音基础模型如Whisper和SeamlessM4T的封闭性导致可复现性和公平评估挑战，需推动语音领域的开放科学。

Method: 开发FAMA模型，使用150k+小时的开源语音数据训练，并引入16k小时的清洗和伪标注数据集。

Result: FAMA性能与现有模型相当，速度提升8倍，所有代码、数据和模型均开源。

Conclusion: FAMA推动了语音技术的开放科学发展，解决了封闭模型的局限性。

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and
SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However,
their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major
reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made
substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models
trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain
limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science
SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data.
Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and
pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves
competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times
faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under
OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了StressTest基准和数据集Stress17k，用于评估和提升语音感知语言模型（SLMs）对句子重音的理解能力，并通过微调模型StresSLM显著提高了性能。

Motivation: 句子重音在表达意图和塑造意义上起关键作用，但在SLMs的开发与评估中常被忽视。

Method: 提出StressTest基准和合成数据生成流程Stress17k，用于训练和微调SLMs。

Result: 微调后的模型StresSLM在句子重音推理和检测任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据微调可以有效提升SLMs对句子重音的理解能力。

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken
utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It
is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated.
Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct
processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the
full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as
spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in
shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation
and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's
ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the
stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find
that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation
pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning
implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models
with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables
effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model,
StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress
reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples -

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将面向反馈的注释整合到自动作文评分（AES）中，可以提高评分的准确性。

Motivation: 研究旨在通过整合反馈驱动的注释来提升自动作文评分的表现。

Method: 使用PERSUADE语料库，整合拼写与语法错误标识以及论证成分高亮两种注释类型，并运用两种大语言模型生成注释。

Result: 结果显示，通过将注释整合到评分过程中，使用编码器大语言模型进行微调的分类器可以提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，反馈驱动的注释可以有效提高自动作文评分的准确性。

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into
the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES).
This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting,
and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We
integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify
spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative
components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world
scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language
model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained
to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into
the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using
encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于树库的方法，通过依赖解析语料库比较口语和书面语的句法结构，揭示了两种模态在句法多样性、分布和重叠上的显著差异。

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索口语和书面语在句法结构上的差异，以理解实时交互和书面表达的独特需求如何影响句法组织。

Method: 采用自下而上的归纳方法，从英语和斯洛文尼亚语的Universal Dependencies树库中提取去词汇化的依赖子树，分析其规模、多样性、分布及模态间的重叠。

Result: 结果显示口语语料库的句法结构更少且多样性较低，与书面语的句法库重叠有限，存在明显的模态特异性偏好。

Conclusion: 论文结论认为这一语言无关的框架为系统研究句法变异提供了通用方法，为基于数据的语法理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic
structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a
fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as
delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,
English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and
distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the
structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both
languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures
than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences
for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between
spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures
attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific
preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of
real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further
supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific
structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,
context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,
language-independent framework offers a useful general method for
systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the
groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

### [8] [MEDAL: A Framework for Benchmarking LLMs as Multilingual Open-Domain Chatbots and Dialogue Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22777)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个自动化多智能体框架MEDAL，用于生成、评估和整理更具代表性和多样性的开放域对话评估基准，以解决现有基准数据集静态、过时和缺乏多语言覆盖的问题。

Motivation: 当前评估聊天机器人性能的基准数据集大多静态、过时且缺乏多语言覆盖，无法捕捉细致的语言和文化差异，阻碍了聊天机器人的进一步发展。

Method: 利用多个先进LLM生成基于多样化上下文的用户-聊天机器人多语言对话，并使用GPT-4.1进行多维性能分析，最终整理出一个新的多语言元评估基准。

Result: 研究发现，现有的LLM在检测涉及同理心和推理的细微问题时表现不佳。

Conclusion: MEDAL框架能够生成更全面的评估基准，但当前LLM在评估开放域对话时仍有局限性。

Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to
dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a
major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available
benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in
multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and
cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent
framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and
diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages
several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,
conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a
multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering
noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale
evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and
human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then
used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act
as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to
detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成系统综述（SR）时是否能达到临床专家水平，通过MedEvidence基准测试发现LLMs在关键评估和多文档推理方面存在不足。

Motivation: 随着科学文献的爆炸式增长，自动化生成系统综述的需求增加，但LLMs在此任务上的能力尚不明确，尤其是与专家结论的一致性。

Method: 研究提出MedEvidence基准，包含100个系统综述及其基础研究，评估了24种LLM的性能，包括推理、非推理、医学专用及不同规模的模型。

Result: 结果显示，推理能力未必提升表现，模型规模与性能提升无必然关联，且基于知识的微调降低了准确性。模型普遍对低质量研究缺乏科学怀疑态度。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs已在临床中应用，但其在系统综述任务上仍需改进，尚无法可靠匹配专家结论。

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence
across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a
cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy.
Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest
in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the
ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple
documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts
remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions
of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same
studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing
findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs
on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and
models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,
we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models
do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning
degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar
behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their
responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show
a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results
suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the
observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already
deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to
the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MixORE 是一个用于混合已知和新关系学习的两阶段框架，旨在解决开放关系抽取中的实际问题，实验表明其在基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现实世界中新关系分布复杂且未标记数据包含已知和新关系混合，而传统方法无法有效处理这种情景。

Method: 提出 MixORE 两阶段框架，结合关系分类和聚类来联合学习已知与新关系。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验显示，MixORE 在已知关系分类和新关系聚类上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MixORE 推动了广义开放关系抽取的研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel
relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined
relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the
unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known
and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are
arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting
that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances.
To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates
relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel
relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE
consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification
and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of
generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍了“旁听智能体”这一新范式，即不直接参与对话而是通过“旁听”人类对话提供辅助，并以《龙与地下城》游戏为案例进行了实证研究。

Motivation: 探讨一种新型的LLM智能体交互方式——旁听智能体，旨在通过被动监听人类对话提供背景任务支持或建议。

Method: 采用大型多模态音频-语言模型作为旁听智能体，辅助《龙与地下城》游戏中的地下城主，并通过人工评估验证其有效性。

Result: 研究发现某些大型音频-语言模型能通过隐含音频线索完成旁听任务，具备涌现能力。

Conclusion: 旁听智能体范式展现了潜力，开源工具支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist
human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with
LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not
actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on
human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide
suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents
paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an
in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing
agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the
helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have
the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio
cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support
further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at
https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

### [12] [Self-Critique and Refinement for Faithful Natural Language Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22823)

Key words: 大语言模型、自然语言解释、忠实度、自批评、特征归因

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 SR-NLE 的框架，通过自批评和迭代改进，提升大语言模型生成的自然语言解释（NLE）的忠实度，无需外部监督。实验显示该方法显著降低了不忠实率。

Motivation: 当前大语言模型生成的自然语言解释通常不能真实反映模型的推理过程，缺乏忠实度。尽管模型能自我批评和改进输出，但这一能力尚未被用于提升解释的忠实度。

Method: 引入 SR-NLE 框架，结合自然语言自反馈和基于特征归因的新反馈机制，通过迭代批评和改进提升 NLE 的忠实度，无需额外训练或监督。

Result: 在三个数据集和四种先进 LLM 上的实验表明，SR-NLE 将平均不忠实率从基线 54.81% 降至 36.02%，绝对降低了 18.79%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过适当反馈引导，LLMs 能够改进其解释，更真实地反映推理过程，且无需额外训练或微调。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language
explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model
predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the
model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that
LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this
capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To
address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural
Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the
faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs --
through an iterative critique and refinement process without external
supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the
refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a
novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important
input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art
LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with
our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to
54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal
that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better
reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance
through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs生成评估基准的成本低于人工众包，但生成的基准对LLMs的挑战性较低，需重新评估该方法。

Motivation: 探讨LLMs生成评估基准的有效性和挑战性，与传统人工众包对比。

Method: 通过两个案例研究（CondaQA和DROP）对比LLM生成与人工众包的基准。

Result: LLM生成基准成本低且常有效，但对LLMs的挑战性较低。

Conclusion: 需审慎评估LLMs生成基准的即时使用，因其可能缺乏挑战性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation.
However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging
paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting
shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether
LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and
comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we
evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two
high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning
about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find
that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid
according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the
original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging
for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on
what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for
critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent
approach to benchmark creation.

Motivation: 现有位置编码方法缺乏理论清晰性，且依赖有限评估指标来证明其外推能力。BAM旨在提供一个理论框架，统一现有方法并提出新的位置先验，以提升长文本处理能力。

Method: 提出了贝叶斯注意力机制（BAM），将位置编码建模为概率模型的先验。该方法整合了NoPE和ALiBi等现有方法，并提出了一种新的广义高斯位置先验。

Result: BAM在训练上下文长度的500倍情况下仍能准确检索信息，长上下文检索准确率优于现有最佳方法，同时保持困惑度相当且引入极少额外参数。

Conclusion: BAM提供了一个理论清晰且性能优越的位置编码框架，显著提升了长文本的泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle
token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE
methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to
substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention
Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as
a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE
and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that
substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables
accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long
context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and
introducing minimal additional parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出LITEX，一种语言学分类法，用于分析NLI中标注者同标签但不同推理的“标签内变异”问题，并验证其在解释生成中的有效性。

Motivation: 解决NLI中标注者同标签但推理差异的“标签内变异”问题，揭示标注背后的逻辑。

Method: 引入LITEX分类法，标注e-SNLI数据集子集，验证分类法可靠性，并评估其在解释生成中的应用。

Result: LITEX生成的解释比仅依赖标签或高亮的方法更接近人类解释。

Conclusion: LITEX能有效捕捉标签内变异，并提升模型与人类解释的一致性。

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural
Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same
premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where
annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an
additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain
highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the
NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text
explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To
systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales
behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for
categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset
of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it
aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the
taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that
conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically
closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or
highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also
shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between
human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt)方法，用于多语言新闻叙事的层级分类，并在SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2中取得了英语测试集的第一名。

Motivation: 在线新闻和错误信息的激增需要自动数据分析方法。叙事分类对事实核查和政策制定者至关重要。

Method: 提出三步提示策略的H3Prompt方法：先分领域，再识别主叙事，最后分配次叙事。

Result: 在28个团队中，英语测试集排名第一。

Conclusion: H3Prompt在多语言叙事分类任务中表现优秀。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news and the increasing spread of misinformation
necessitate robust methods for automatic data analysis. Narrative
classification is emerging as a important task, since identifying what is being
said online is critical for fact-checkers, policy markers and other
professionals working on information studies. This paper presents our approach
to SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2, which aims to classify news articles into a
pre-defined two-level taxonomy of main narratives and sub-narratives across
multiple languages.
  We propose Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt) for multilingual
narrative classification. Our methodology follows a three-step Large Language
Model (LLM) prompting strategy, where the model first categorises an article
into one of two domains (Ukraine-Russia War or Climate Change), then identifies
the most relevant main narratives, and finally assigns sub-narratives. Our
approach secured the top position on the English test set among 28 competing
teams worldwide. The code is available at https://github.com/GateNLP/H3Prompt.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在多语言推理中的表现，发现其非英语推理能力不足，并探讨了通过提示干预和针对性训练改善的方法。

Motivation: 研究动机在于验证LRMs在非英语语言中的推理能力，这对实际应用中的用户监督至关重要，因为用户需要以母语理解的推理过程。

Method: 通过XReasoning基准全面评估两种主流LRMs，并测试了提示干预和针对性训练对模型表现的影响。

Result: 研究发现，即使最先进的模型在多语言推理中仍依赖英语或产生碎片化推理。提示干预改善了可读性但降低了准确性，而小规模针对性训练部分缓解了这一问题。

Conclusion: 当前LRMs的多语言推理能力有限，需进一步研究以提升其在非英语语言中的表现。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong
performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in
other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer
accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace
useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We
comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning
benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English
or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap
in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to
reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce
answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted
post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some
accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning
capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VIGNETTE，一个大规模视觉问答基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的偏见，涵盖事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策四个方向，揭示了模型如何通过视觉线索构建社会意义并表现出歧视性行为。

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）的偏见研究较多，但视觉语言模型（VLMs）的偏见问题关注较少。现有研究多局限于肖像类图像和性别-职业关联，忽略了更广泛的社会刻板印象及其潜在危害。

Method: 通过构建包含3000万张图像的VIGNETTE基准，采用视觉问答框架，从事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策四个维度评估VLMs的偏见行为，并结合社会心理学分析视觉线索与社会推断的关联。

Result: 研究发现VLMs在上下文环境中会做出特质和能力假设，表现出歧视性行为，且编码了社会等级。揭示了模型通过视觉线索构建社会意义的微妙、多面和令人惊讶的刻板模式。

Conclusion: 研究为理解VLMs如何从输入中构建社会意义提供了新视角，强调了评估和减少VLM偏见的重要性。

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns
in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention.
Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and
gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social
stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a
large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through
a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality,
perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered
studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings,
revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns
of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect
visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social
hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle,
multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how
VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了学生考试失败时归因的影响，并提出了一个认知基础的偏见评估框架，用于识别LLM如何基于人口统计归因事件结果。

Motivation: 研究动机在于理解人类和LLM如何归因事件结果，尤其是基于人口统计的归因可能引发的公平性问题。

Method: 提出了一个认知基础的偏见评估框架，分析LLM在归因推理中的差异及其对人口统计群体的偏见影响。

Result: 揭示了LLM在归因推理中的偏见机制，尤其是如何将事件结果不公平地归因于特定人口统计群体。

Conclusion: 研究强调了认知基础框架的重要性，以更深入地理解和解决LLM中的偏见问题，确保其公平性。

Abstract: When a student fails an exam, do we tend to blame their effort or the test's
difficulty? Attribution, defined as how reasons are assigned to event outcomes,
shapes perceptions, reinforces stereotypes, and influences decisions.
Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign
responsibility for events using implicit cognition, attributing causes to
internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck)
factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries
important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs
focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes
a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models'
reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

TL;DR: ER-Reason是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估大语言模型在急诊室环境中的临床推理和决策能力，揭示了现有模型与医生推理之间的差距。

Motivation: 现实世界中的医疗评估通常依赖昂贵的人工标注，且现有基准测试难以捕捉完整的临床推理过程，尤其是在急诊室这种高压环境下。

Method: ER-Reason基准包括3,984名患者的25,174份临床记录，涵盖急诊工作流的关键阶段，并包含72份医生撰写的推理过程。

Result: 评估表明，当前大语言模型在急诊决策中的临床推理与医生推理存在显著差距。

Conclusion: ER-Reason凸显了进一步研究以弥合大语言模型与临床推理差距的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical
question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world
evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks
tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or
full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce
ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and
decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where
clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient
presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes
data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal
clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and
physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER
provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key
stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment
selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to
reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via
rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales
explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in
residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and
clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need
for future research to bridge this divide.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长期上下文理解中的局限性。

Method: 结合显式记忆单元、门控写入机制和基于注意力的读取模块，引入遗忘函数动态更新记忆内容，并通过联合训练目标优化记忆操作。

Result: 模型在文本生成一致性、多轮问答稳定性和跨上下文推理准确性方面表现优越，显著缓解了传统模型的上下文丢失和语义漂移问题。

Conclusion: 记忆机制对语言理解至关重要，所提方法在架构设计和性能上均有效。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in
understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with
a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic
information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit
memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A
forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content,
enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further
improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint
training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory
writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies
during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows
that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency,
stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context
reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and
contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering
scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift
problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term
dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory
structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further
confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both
architectural design and performance outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种名为OSRM的方法，通过在微调前约束LoRA子空间，解决现有模型合并方法在LoRA微调模型上性能下降的问题，提升多任务合并效果。

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法在低秩自适应（LoRA）微调的模型上表现不佳，导致性能显著下降。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出OSRM方法，在微调前约束LoRA子空间，减少任务间的干扰，并与现有合并算法兼容。

Result: 在八个数据集、五种语言模型上的实验表明，OSRM提高了合并性能并保持单任务准确性，且对超参数更鲁棒。

Conclusion: OSRM为LoRA模型的合并提供了一种即插即用的解决方案，强调了数据-参数交互在模型合并中的重要性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong
performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore
model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task
model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail
for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a
previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data
distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM)
to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates
relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach
can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the
unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets,
tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our
method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task
accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the
hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of
data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution
for merging LoRA models.

Abstract: This study presents an efficient transformer-based question-answering (QA)
model optimized for deployment on a 13th Gen Intel i7-1355U CPU, using the
Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v1.1. Leveraging exploratory data

accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes it well-suited for real-time
applications on resource-constrained systems. The study includes systematic
evaluation of data augmentation strategies and hyperparameter configurations,

Conclusion: 规则化强化学习框架可显著增强业务场景下网页代理的推理与导航能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex,
real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing
web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with
generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when
handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we
introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based
R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance
single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks.
We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output
formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly
learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive
expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark
demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by
10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary
LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在多语言和跨语言环境中的记忆能力，验证其是否能通过翻译回忆原文内容。

Method: 使用OWL数据集（包含10种语言的3.15万条对齐文本），通过直接探测、命名填空和前缀生成三种任务评估模型记忆能力。

Result: 模型表现出跨语言记忆能力，GPT-4o在新翻译文本中识别作者和书名的准确率为69%，实体预测为6%。干扰操作（如乱序）对准确率影响有限（官方翻译乱序下降7%）。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在多语言场景下具有显著的跨语言记忆能力，且对干扰具有一定鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text
from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability
generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains
unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in
LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be
recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset
of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English
originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new
translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,
Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families
and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to
identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting
masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating
continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,
even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for
example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%
of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking
characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop
for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of
cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the
models.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的广泛应用，评估其对否定的理解能力变得尤为重要，因为否定能够完全改变句子的意义。

Method: 通过利用大型语言模型生成现有VQA数据集中问题的否定版本，构建了包含7,379个问题的NegVQA基准。

Result: 测试了20个先进视觉语言模型，发现它们对否定问题表现显著下降，且模型规模呈现U型扩展趋势。

Conclusion: NegVQA揭示了视觉语言模型在否定理解上的不足，并为未来模型的发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a
training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through
sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into
prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local
context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and
Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on
ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves
both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and
vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and
9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content.
These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective
approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training
or task-specific tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了4种LLM在3个论点挖掘任务中的表现，发现大型和微调模型表现优秀但能耗高，且对长文本和情感语言存在系统性短板。

Motivation: 探索LLM在争议性议题（如堕胎）的公共讨论中自动检测和分析论点的能力，填补其在预定义论点挖掘任务中的研究空白。

Method: 使用包含6个极化议题的2000多条评论数据集，对4种先进LLM在3个论点挖掘任务上进行定量评估和错误分析。

Result: 大型及微调模型整体表现优异但环境代价高，且在长文本、复杂语境和情感语言中表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在在线评论的论点自动分析中具有潜力，但仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues
like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks,
their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online
comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three
argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments
across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall
strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned
LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error
analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and
emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like
content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise
and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online
comments.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSE-Bench是一个用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在健康、安全与环境（HSE）合规评估中的能力的基准数据集，包含1000多个手工编写的问题，并基于IRAC（问题识别、规则回溯、规则应用、规则结论）框架评估模型的推理能力。虽然当前LLMs表现良好，但其能力更多依赖语义匹配而非基于HSE合规背景的原则性推理。为此，作者提出了一种新的提示技术RoE（专家推理），以模拟专家推理过程，提高决策准确性。

Motivation: HSE合规评估需要复杂法规和人机环境交互下的实时决策，但现有LLMs在领域知识和结构化法律推理方面的能力尚未充分探索，因此需要专门的基准和方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出HSE-Bench基准数据集，包含多样化的HSE相关问题，并基于IRAC框架设计推理流程；进一步提出RoE提示技术，模拟专家推理过程。

Result: 当前LLMs在HSE-Bench上表现良好，但主要依赖语义匹配，缺乏系统性的法律推理能力；RoE技术显著提升了模型在合规评估中的准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs在HSE合规评估中仍有推理缺陷，RoE技术为改进提供了方向，未来需进一步研究相关任务。

Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic
real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex
human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold
significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their
capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning
remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM.
HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from
regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a
reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule
Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct
extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,
including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The
results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their
capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning
grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native
reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE
compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting
technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the
reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a
more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in
LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种增强LLM说服力的新方法ToMAP，通过整合两个心智理论模块来提升对对手心理状态的分析与响应，实验显示其性能优于更大规模的基线模型。

Motivation: 现有LLM在说服任务中缺乏对手心理的动态建模能力（心智理论），导致生成内容多样性和对手意识不足。

Method: 设计了ToMAP方法，结合文本编码器和MLP分类器预测对手立场，并通过强化学习优化辩论生成策略。

Result: ToMAP在含3B参数的模型上表现优于GPT-4o等大模型，相对增益达39.4%，且生成内容更具多样性和逻辑性。

Conclusion: ToMAP通过心智理论增强实现了更有效的说服策略，适用于长对话场景，为开发更具说服力的语言代理提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,
but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,
while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions
proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind
(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To
address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader
(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by
incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness
and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by
prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central
claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to
predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully
designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to
analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective
arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B
parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative
gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,
ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,
which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature
of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ
more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our
method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more
persuasive language agents. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文首次实证研究了电子健康记录（EHR）基础模型的缩放规律，发现其与大型语言模型（LLMs）类似，为资源高效训练策略提供了预测性见解。

Motivation: 尽管缩放规律在大型语言模型领域已被广泛研究，但在电子健康记录（EHR）这一结构上与自然语言不同的丰富数据源中，这些规律尚未被探索。

Method: 通过在MIMIC-IV数据库中的患者时间序列数据上，训练不同规模的Transformer模型，并调整计算预算，研究缩放规律。

Result: 发现了EHR模型与LLMs类似的缩放行为，包括抛物线IsoFLOPs曲线和计算、模型参数、数据量与临床效用之间的幂律关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发强大的EHR基础模型奠定了基础，有望推动临床预测任务和个性化医疗的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large
language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through
systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these
principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health
records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that
differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first
empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training
transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database
across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling
patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships
between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These
findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to
LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies.
Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models
capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized
healthcare.

TL;DR: VeGraph是一个利用大型语言模型(LLMs)进行复杂声明验证的框架，通过图表示、实体消歧和验证三个阶段，显著提升了解释性和准确性。

Motivation: 复杂声明由于其语义结构或混淆实体，传统验证方法在实体消歧上表现不足，亟需新方法提升验证的准确性和解释性。

Method: VeGraph分三个阶段：(1)图表示，将声明分解为三元组；(2)实体消歧，与知识库交互解决歧义；(3)验证，完成三元组的事实核查。

Result: 在HoVer和FEVEROUS基准测试中，VeGraph使用Meta-Llama-3-70B模型表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VeGraph通过图结构和LLM推理能力，有效解决了复杂声明的验证挑战，为后续研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not
only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This
task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models
(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic
structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address
this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to
resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective
disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire
verification process. To address these challenges, we propose
Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and
comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)
Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,
forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and
unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively
interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the
graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining
triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using
Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive
performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,
effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data
are available for further exploitation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyePack是一种通过后门攻击检测模型是否使用了基准测试集的框架，无需访问模型内部细节。

Motivation: 开放基准测试容易被污染，需要一种透明的方法来检测模型的训练数据来源。

Method: DyePack通过混合带有后门的测试数据，标记那些使用测试集训练的模型，使用随机目标的多后门设计。

Result: 在多项选择和开放生成任务中，DyePack成功检测出所有污染模型，误报率极低。

Conclusion: DyePack提供了一种高效且可靠的方法来检测模型是否使用了测试集进行训练，避免误报。

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language
models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility
makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce
DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that
used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,
logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with
their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data
to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating
multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate
(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false
accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of
contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,
covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For
multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with
guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard
using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and
identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive
rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Conclusion: 研究为连接学术研究与实际应用提供了见解，并提出了开发高效AI代理的框架。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant
improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and
chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to
industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible
conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific
constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the
probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to
addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome
their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical
case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain,
detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide
insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world
application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and
reliable AI-driven agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于参考过滤和TF-IDF聚类的隐蔽后门样本检测方法（RFTC），以解决LLMs在微调过程中可能引入的安全风险。通过实验验证，该方法在检测后门和模型性能上优于现有基线。

Motivation: 主流检测方法在生成任务中不适用或可能降低生成性能，因此需要一种能高效去除隐蔽中毒样本的新方法。

Method: RFTC方法通过参考模型输出与样本响应的差异筛选可疑样本，再通过TF-IDF聚类根据类内距离识别真正的中毒样本。

Result: 在两个机器翻译数据集和一个QA数据集上的实验表明，RFTC在后门检测和模型性能上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RFTC方法能有效检测隐蔽后门样本，且参考过滤机制的作用得到了验证。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers
poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods
either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of
poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the
stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,
while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.
Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains
an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the
sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances
between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely
because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more
scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and
Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample
response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious
if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on
these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the
intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one
QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection
and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also
confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

TL;DR: 研究了知识编辑（KE）方法在大型语言模型中的应用，提出了评估上下文鲁棒性的新基准CHED，并开发了提高鲁棒性的CoRE方法。

Motivation: 现有KE评估仅关注编辑后的知识而忽略前置上下文的影响，而实际应用中前置上下文可能触发原有知识，削弱编辑效果，需解决这一问题。

Method: 开发CHED基准评估KE方法的上下文鲁棒性，提出CoRE方法通过最小化隐藏状态的上下文敏感方差来提升鲁棒性。

Result: 评估显示KE方法在前置上下文下常失效，CoRE方法显著提高了编辑成功率且不影响模型整体能力。

Conclusion: 前置上下文对KE效果有显著影响，CoRE方法有效提升鲁棒性，为KE应用提供更可靠支持。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in
large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success
by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In
real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the
retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address
this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context
robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when
preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce
CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing
context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.
This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a
preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the
model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding
contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we
dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence
editing success.

Motivation: 研究可视化性和具体性这两个心理语言学特性，通常需要依赖视觉和语义空间的平行数据，但假设仅通过图像-标题数据集中的文本信号即可准确估计这些特性。

Method: 提出NSM方法，通过分析语义嵌入空间中单词邻域的峰值尖锐度来估计可视化性和具体性，无需监督且分布无关。

Result: NSM与人工标注结果的相关性优于现有无监督方法，并能有效预测可视化性和具体性。

Conclusion: NSM是一种高效的无监督方法，适用于估计文本的可视化性和具体性。

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub

Motivation: 通用临床 NLP 工具在临床报告自动标注中应用广泛，但针对特定任务（如儿科胸片报告标注）的独立评估有限，因此需要对比不同工具的性能差异。

Method: 研究分析了 95,008 份儿科胸片报告，使用四种商业 NLP 系统提取实体和断言状态，并对比了 CheXpert 和 CheXbert 的性能，通过 Fleiss Kappa 和准确率评估结果。

Result: 不同 NLP 系统在实体提取数量和断言检测准确率上差异显著，SP 表现最佳（76%），AWS 最差（50%），CheXpert 和 CheXbert 准确率为 56%。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，临床 NLP 工具性能差异较大，部署前需谨慎验证和审查，以确保标注质量。

Abstract: General-purpose clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools are
increasingly used for the automatic labeling of clinical reports. However,
independent evaluations for specific tasks, such as pediatric chest radiograph
(CXR) report labeling, are limited. This study compares four commercial
clinical NLP systems - Amazon Comprehend Medical (AWS), Google Healthcare NLP
(GC), Azure Clinical NLP (AZ), and SparkNLP (SP) - for entity extraction and
assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and
CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the
same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR
reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion
statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression
sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities
mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and
CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss
Kappa and accuracy against a consensus pseudo-ground truth. Significant
differences were found in the number of extracted entities and assertion
distributions across NLP systems. SP extracted 49,688 unique entities, GC
16,477, AZ 31,543, and AWS 27,216. Assertion accuracy across models averaged
around 62%, with SP highest (76%) and AWS lowest (50%). CheXpert and CheXbert
achieved 56% accuracy. Considerable variability in performance highlights the
need for careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical
report labeling.

TL;DR: 论文研究机器面向英语（MFE）这一新兴语言现象，探讨人类与AI交互中形成的简化语言特征及其影响。

Motivation: 随着AI对话增多，人类语言逐渐适应机器解析，形成MFE。研究旨在理解这种语言适应的特征及其对交流和设计的启示。

Method: 基于双语（韩语/英语）语音和文本产品测试的定性观察，采用自然语言声明性提示（NLD-P）进行分析，识别MFE的五大特征。

Result: 发现MFE具有冗余清晰性、指令性语法、受限词汇、平坦韵律和单一意图结构等特征，虽提高机器准确性但牺牲语言自然性。

Conclusion: MFE的发展凸显了交流效率与语言丰富性之间的张力，呼吁更全面的方法论阐述和未来实证验证。

Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation
of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on
register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience
design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this
study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity,
pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance
machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is
grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and
text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using
Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic
analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive
syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring
- that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's
evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and
linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces
and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by
underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future
empirical validation.

Motivation: 社交媒体评论的语言自由且主题多样，给NLP任务（如评论聚类、总结和意见分析）带来挑战。本文旨在通过生成评论方面的术语来引导模型注意力，提升任务效果。

Method: 利用多语言大语言模型进行监督微调，生成评论方面的术语（CAT-G），并通过DPO（Direct Preference Optimization）对齐模型预测与人类期望。

Conclusion: 提出的CAT-G方法在多语言环境中表现优异，测试集为跨语言性能比较提供了基础。

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of
language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses
significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering,
comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we
propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from
individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage
multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment
aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with
human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks.
Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on
English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among
languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance
across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出EL4NER方法，通过集成多个开源小参数LLM的ICL输出，在NER任务中以更低成本提升性能，并在某些数据集上达到SOTA。

Motivation: 解决当前ICL-based NER方法依赖大参数LLM导致的高计算成本、API费用及隐私问题，提出用小参数开源模型替代方案。

Method: 设计任务分解流水线、提出面向NER的span级句子相似度算法、加入自验证机制，实现高效集成学习。

Result: EL4NER在多领域NER数据集上性能超越大参数闭源LLM，部分任务达SOTA，且参数量更低。

Conclusion: 证明开源小参数LLM在ICL范式下的可行性，参数效率高，为NER任务提供低成本解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower
computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger
generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on
large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational
resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high
API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To
address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity
Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple
open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks
at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three
key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that
facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel
span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration
retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a
self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble
process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from
diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most
closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and
even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on
certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and
underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs
within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.

TL;DR: RAGRouter是一种智能路由机制，通过结合检索文档的影响，优化了在RAG场景下多LLM模型的选择，显著提升了性能。

Motivation: 现有路由方法在RAG场景中表现不佳，因为它们依赖于静态知识表示，而外部文档会动态影响LLM的响应能力。

Method: 提出RAGRouter，利用文档嵌入和RAG能力嵌入，通过对比学习捕捉知识表示变化，支持更智能的路由决策。

Result: RAGRouter在多种知识密集型任务中平均优于最佳单LLM模型3.61%，并超越现有路由方法3.29%-9.33%。

Conclusion: RAGRouter通过动态结合检索文档的影响，显著提升了路由性能，并在低延迟约束下实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying
response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing
mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple
retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external
documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing
routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations,
exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally
define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the
influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose
RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and
RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge
representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive
experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show
that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and
existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based
mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under
low-latency constraints.

TL;DR: 小模型在代码生成中难以通过自我反思进行有效修正，CoCoS方法通过强化学习提升其多轮修正能力，显著提高了性能。

Motivation: 探究小语言模型是否能够通过自我反思提升代码生成能力，弥补现有研究中仅关注大模型的不足。

Method: 提出CoCoS方法，采用在线强化学习目标，设计累积奖励函数和细粒度奖励，以优化多轮修正过程中的模型行为。

Result: CoCoS在1B规模模型上，MBPP和HumanEval任务分别提升了35.8%和27.7%的性能。

Conclusion: CoCoS有效提升了小语言模型的多轮代码修正能力，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing
language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive
refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that
incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as
training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.
However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their
outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that
smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both
self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach
designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code
correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective
that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while
progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach
features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the
entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn
correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response
quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With
1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on
HumanEval compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SNS-Bench-VL，一个用于评估视觉语言大型语言模型在社交媒体场景中表现的多模态基准。

Motivation: 鉴于社交网络中视觉和文本内容日益融合，需要评估LLM的多模态能力以提升用户体验和平台智能化。现有基准主要关注文本任务，缺乏对多模态上下文的覆盖。

Method: 提出了SNS-Bench-VL，包含8项多模态任务和4,001个精心设计的图像-文本问答对，评估了25种先进的多模态LLM在不同任务中的表现。

Result: 研究揭示了多模态社交语境理解中的持续挑战。

Conclusion: 希望SNS-Bench-VL能推动未来研究，发展更鲁棒、情境感知且与人类对齐的多模态智能。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social
Networking Services (SNS), evaluating the multimodal capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing user experience, content
understanding, and platform intelligence. Existing benchmarks primarily focus
on text-centric tasks, lacking coverage of the multimodal contexts prevalent in
modern SNS ecosystems. In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a
comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of
Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL
incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note
comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and
personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal
question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended
tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their
performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in
multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire
future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal
intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的MBR解码方法MBR-OT，用于解决文档级文本生成任务中的性能问题，通过Wasserstein距离结合句子级效用函数提升效果。

Motivation: 文档级文本生成任务因需要理解更长上下文而更具挑战性，现有的MBR解码方法在句子级任务中表现良好，但在文档级任务中效果有限。

Method: 提出MBR-OT，一种基于Wasserstein距离的MBR解码变体，利用句子级效用函数计算文档级效用。

Result: 实验表明，MBR-OT在文档级机器翻译、文本简化和密集图像描述任务中优于标准MBR。

Conclusion: MBR-OT通过改进的效用计算方式提升了文档级文本生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than
sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of
longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate
the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text
generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the
output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.
Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of
sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text
generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for
evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant
of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document
using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the
performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level
machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLM）生成更多样化的训练数据以提升关系抽取（RE）任务的性能，并提出了两种方法：基于上下文的指令调整和直接偏好优化（DPO）。实验表明，这些方法能有效提升生成数据的质量，并发现用LLM生成的数据训练非LLM模型可能效果更佳。

Motivation: 当前直接利用LLM生成RE训练数据时，样本结构相似性高且表达方式单一，影响了数据的多样性和质量，因此需要研究如何提升数据的多样性和正确性。

Method: 1. 通过上下文学习（ICL）指令引导LLM生成多样化样本；2. 通过直接偏好优化（DPO）对LLM进行微调以生成更多样化的训练数据。

Result: 实验证明两种方法均能提升生成数据的质量，且用LLM生成的数据训练非LLM模型在RE任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 通过调整LLM的生成方式可以有效提升RE训练数据的多样性，同时非LLM模型在利用这些数据时可能表现更好。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially
be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many
problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation
Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may
easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a
limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of
entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the
diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also
maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar
samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.
Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample
generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on
commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of
the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly
performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated
samples may lead to better performance.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为Alignment Data Map的工具，通过GPT-4o分析偏好数据，仅需33%的数据即可达到或超越全数据集性能，显著提升数据收集效率。

Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，阻碍了大型语言模型与人类价值观的对齐，因此需要一种高效的数据诊断工具。

Method: 使用GPT-4o作为LLM对齐的代理，计算LLM生成响应的对齐分数，构建基于均值和方差的Alignment Data Map。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用33%的高均值、低方差数据即可达到或超越全数据集性能，并能有效检测低效或错误标注样本。

Conclusion: Alignment Data Map能显著提升数据收集效率，无需显式标注即可识别高质量样本，并可诊断现有数据集。

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and
inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we
introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and
diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we
compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from
existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an
Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that
using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean,
low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using
the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can
significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality
samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the
Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis
shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated
samples. Source code is available online.

Motivation: 临床决策依赖于多源证据的多模态推理，但目前多模态推理模型在医疗领域的应用仍不足，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 通过两阶段后训练：第一阶段用2000个文本数据微调模型以激发推理行为；第二阶段用1500个多模态医学案例增强推理能力。

Result: MedE^2在多模态医学基准测试中优于基线模型，且在大模型和推理扩展验证中表现出鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: MedE^2有效提升了医疗多模态推理模型的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning
across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal
reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex
tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and
science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that
elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I,
we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely
orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In
Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500
rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs
with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in
improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably,
models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across
multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models
and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical
utility of our approach.

TL;DR: Multi-modal large language models struggle with multi-turn interactions, especially in long contexts. The paper introduces ContextQFormer, a context modeling module, and a new multi-turn dialogue dataset (TMDialog) to address this issue, showing a 2%-4% improvement over baselines.

Motivation: Existing open-source multi-modal models lack robust multi-turn interaction capabilities, particularly for long contexts. This paper aims to enhance contextual understanding and interaction.

Method: Proposes ContextQFormer, a context modeling module with a memory block, and constructs TMDialog, a multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset for training and evaluation.

Result: ContextQFormer achieves a 2%-4% improvement in available rate over baselines on the TMDialog dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed ContextQFormer and TMDialog dataset effectively address multi-turn interaction challenges in multi-modal models, demonstrating measurable improvements.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing
open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn
interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first
introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a
memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information.
Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of
2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Motivation: 探究LLMs的抽象推理能力是否足够泛化到实际重要问题，尤其是历史语言学中的归纳推理任务。

Method: 开发了一个自动化流水线，动态生成可控制难度的基准测试，以解决扩展性和污染问题。

Result: 生成包含近1k实例的测试集，最佳模型（Claude-3.7-Sonnet）通过率仅为54%，显示LLMs在此类推理任务中存在困难。

Conclusion: LCoT LLMs在历史语言学等领域的泛化推理能力仍有待提升。

Abstract: Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have
taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning
capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models
general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which
has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a
historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as
Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically
generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to
tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks
are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k
instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the
best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating
that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in
historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了LLMs在机器翻译中的准确性，还能以最小资源消耗增强其在其他NLP任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across
multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However,
persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such
as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy
of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and
tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we
propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by
acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically
analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in
a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs
caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and
apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more
accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset
of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to
multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates
effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both
similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method
requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across
multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Abstract: Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) is generally based on common domain data to
obtain monolingual word embedding, and by aligning the monolingual word
embeddings to obtain the cross-lingual embeddings which are used to get the
word translation pairs. In this paper, we propose a new task of BLI, which is
to use the monolingual corpus of the general domain and target domain to
extract domain-specific bilingual dictionaries. Motivated by the ability of
Pre-trained models, we propose a method to get better word embeddings that
build on the recent work on BLI. This way, we introduce the Code Switch(Qin et
al., 2020) firstly in the cross-domain BLI task, which can match differit is
yet to be seen whether these methods are suitable for bilingual lexicon
extraction in professional fields. As we can see in table 1, the classic and
efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical
dataset than on the Wiki dataset. On one hand, the specialized domain data set
is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and
specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the
translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word
embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the
meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only
static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different
contexts, making the model more suitable for this task. Experimental results
show that our method can improve performances over robust BLI baselines on

TL;DR: Retell是一种针对文学文本的主题建模方法，通过生成式语言模型将叙述转化为概念和主题，比传统方法更精确。

Motivation: 文学文本因其叙事性而挑战传统词袋方法，需要更有效的主题建模技术。

Method: 利用生成式语言模型重述文本，再对其应用潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）进行主题建模。

Result: 与单独使用LDA或直接让语言模型生成主题相比，Retell能提供更精确且信息丰富的主题。

Conclusion: Retell在文化分析中表现出潜力，特别是在识别文学文本的高级概念和主题方面。

Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges
lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details
instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show,
don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach
for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models
(LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms
into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of
passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA
alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of
our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to
expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high

Conclusion: ZIPA展示了高效架构和大规模数据在跨语言音素识别中的重要性，但社会语言学多样性仍是未来的研究方向。

Abstract: We present ZIPA, a family of efficient speech models that advances the
state-of-the-art performance of crosslinguistic phone recognition. We first
curated IPAPack++, a large-scale multilingual speech corpus with 17,132 hours
of normalized phone transcriptions and a novel evaluation set capturing unseen
languages and sociophonetic variation. With the large-scale training data,
ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverage
the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperform existing phone recognition
systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training
on 11,000 hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement.
While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals
persistent limitations in modeling sociophonetic diversity, underscoring

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and
summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an
essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on
how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to
infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach,
Map&Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This
facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is
then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the
quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two
challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table
schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully
identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve
a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a
comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings
demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better
interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to
superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in
structured summarization tasks.

TL;DR: Infinite-Instruct是一个自动化框架，通过改进问题逻辑和代码质量，合成高质量代码问答对，提升大语言模型的代码生成能力，实验显示在主流基准上性能显著提升。

Motivation: 传统代码指令数据合成方法多样性有限且逻辑性差，需要一种能自动生成高质量问答对的框架以增强大语言模型的代码生成能力。

Method: 采用‘反向构建’将代码片段转化为多样化编程问题，通过‘反馈构建’将问题关键词构建为知识图谱以增强逻辑性，并利用跨语言静态代码分析过滤无效样本。

Result: 实验表明，微调模型在7B和32B参数模型上分别平均性能提升21.70%和36.95%，仅用不到十分之一的指令微调数据即达到与Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct相当的性能。

Conclusion: Infinite-Instruct为编程领域大语言模型训练提供了可扩展的解决方案，并开源了相关数据集。

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited
diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated
framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to
enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and
the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code
snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding
Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge
graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal
logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid
samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code
generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance
improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter
models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we
achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct.
Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming.
We open-source the datasets used in the experiments, including both unfiltered
versions and filtered versions via static analysis. The data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用语言模型可解释性和不确定性量化来高效识别机器翻译错误的替代方法，替代了传统昂贵且依赖大量标注数据的WQE技术。

Motivation: 探讨如何在无需昂贵标注数据或大语言模型的情况下，通过语言模型内部机制识别机器翻译错误。

Method: 利用语言模型的可解释性和不确定性量化技术，评估14种指标在12种翻译方向上的表现，并使用多组人工标注数据量化标签变异对指标的影响。

Result: 研究发现无监督指标的潜力被低估，监督方法在标签不确定性下表现不佳，且单一标注者的评估实践存在脆弱性。

Conclusion: 无监督方法在WQE领域有潜力，但需解决标签变异和评估方法的问题。

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify
fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses,
including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are
often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc
training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate
efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model
interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors
from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14
metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label
variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our
results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the
shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the
brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAEL框架通过让LLM驱动的智能体进行跨任务经验学习和积累，改进了传统多智能体系统在任务隔离导致的冗余计算和泛化能力不足的问题。

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体系统在处理复杂任务时，通常孤立对待每个任务，导致计算冗余且难以泛化到结构相似的任务。MAEL旨在通过跨任务学习和经验积累解决这一问题。

Method: MAEL采用图结构的多智能体协作网络，智能体通过显式连接进行信息传播和协调。在经验学习阶段，量化任务解决流程中每个步骤的质量，并将奖励、输入和输出存储到个体经验池中。推理时，智能体检索高奖励、任务相关的经验作为少样本示例，优化推理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，MAEL使智能体能高效学习先前任务经验，在当前任务上实现更快的收敛和更高质量的解决方案。

Conclusion: MAEL通过跨任务经验学习显著提升多智能体协作的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable
progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and
inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in
isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization
across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent
cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows
LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience
accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured
multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and
coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase,
we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store
the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each
agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve
high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the
effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and
efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences
effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions
on current tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自主经验迁移框架，使大语言模型能够从现有任务中自动迁移经验到新任务，减少人工依赖并提升模型性能。

Motivation: 现有方法需要大量人工或时间收集任务解决经验，无法应对日益增长的多样化任务需求，因此需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 设计了自主经验迁移框架，模拟人类认知智能，实现任务经验的自动迁移。

Result: 在13个数据集上的实验表明，该框架显著提升了大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅降低了经验获取成本，还为语言模型的泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving
experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods
rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each
task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user
queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience
transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive
intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to
newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of
experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel
path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets
demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.

TL;DR: 提出了MMBoundary框架，通过校准多模态大语言模型在推理步骤中的置信度，提升其知识边界意识，减少幻觉现象。

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在多级、多粒度推理中存在置信度评估不足的问题，导致幻觉累积。

Method: 结合文本和跨模态自奖励信号逐步骤估置信度，并通过监督微调和强化学习校准推理链。

Result: 在多样数据集和指标上显著超越现有方法，置信度校准误差平均减少7.5%，任务性能提升8.3%。

Conclusion: MMBoundary通过逐步骤置信度校准有效提升推理能力。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

TL;DR: MCTSr-Zero是一种针对开放式人机对话优化的MCTS框架，通过‘领域对齐’和‘再生机制’提升心理辅导对话质量，其生成的PsyLLM模型在评估中表现优异。

Motivation: 当前MCTS与LLM结合的方法在开放式对话（如心理辅导）中无法满足主观需求（如同理心），需开发新框架以生成更符合人类价值观的对话。

Method: 提出MCTSr-Zero，核心为‘领域对齐’和‘再生与元提示适应机制’，通过调整搜索目标和扩大策略探索范围优化对话生成。

Result: 实验表明，基于MCTSr-Zero生成的PsyLLM模型在PsyEval等评估中达到最先进水平，验证了其生成高质量对话数据的有效性。

Conclusion: MCTSr-Zero成功解决了LLM在复杂心理标准下的一致性挑战，为人机对话领域提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented
tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those
in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with
objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on
subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment
with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are
ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce
misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS
framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation
is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined
end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain
principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates
"Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden
exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial
dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by
generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.
We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological
counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating
MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned
conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge
of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.

Result: 在ChartMind及三个公共基准上，ChartLLM显著优于常见CQA范式，展示了灵活图表理解的重要性。

Conclusion: ChartMind和ChartLLM为未来开发更强健的图表推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) has become a critical multimodal task for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. While early
approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or
leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid
output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world
demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a
new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind
covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports
open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging
the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.
Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,
that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and
enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive
evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14
mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the
previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and
chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding
for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more
robust chart reasoning in future research.

Conclusion: 多维方法空间显著提升了科学方法查询的效率和结果的相关性，为研究者提供了高效的管理和查询工具。

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

TL;DR: 该论文全面研究了阿拉伯语机器生成文本，通过多种生成策略和模型架构分析了其语言特征，并开发了高性能的检测模型。

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在生成人类类似文本方面能力突出，但在低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）中可能导致信息完整性问题，需要深入研究。

Method: 采用多种生成策略（标题生成、内容感知生成、文本优化）和模型架构（ALLaM、Jais、Llama、GPT-4），结合风格分析开发BERT检测模型。

Result: 检测模型在正式语境中表现优异（F1分数高达99.9%），但跨领域泛化能力仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为阿拉伯语机器生成文本检测奠定了基础，强调需开发语言学驱动的系统以维护信息完整性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in
generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for
information integrity across critical domains, including education, social
media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns,
compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This
challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource
languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of
Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies
(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)
across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,
and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive
linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic
text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we
demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,
with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different
contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models
that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\%
F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain
analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most
comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely
combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and
in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a
foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems
essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

TL;DR: Sentinel通过轻量级句子级压缩框架，利用现成的0.5B代理LLM的解码器注意力信号实现高效问题感知上下文压缩，无需训练专用压缩模型，在保持性能的同时实现5倍压缩。

Motivation: 传统检索增强生成（RAG）方法中，检索到的段落常因冗长、噪声或输入限制而影响效率，而现有压缩方法需监督训练专用模型，成本高且可移植性差。Sentinel旨在探索一种轻量级的上下文压缩方案。

Method: Sentinel通过轻量级分类器分析现成0.5B代理LLM的解码器注意力信号，识别句子相关性，将上下文过滤重构为基于注意力的理解任务，无需训练压缩模型。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，Sentinel实现最高5倍压缩，同时匹配7B规模压缩系统的QA性能，表明小模型注意力信号可有效替代大模型行为。

Conclusion: 利用原生注意力信号能够实现快速、高效且问题感知的上下文压缩，Sentinel为轻量级RAG提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or
exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised
training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing
portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression
framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding
task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder
attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier
to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context
relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies
closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,
Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance
of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native
attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context
compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

Motivation: 当前知识编辑任务过于简单且缺乏真实应用场景的评估，因此需要更复杂的基准来反映实际挑战。

Method: 引入了ScEdit基准，结合反事实和时间编辑，采用标记级和文本级评估方法。

Result: 所有知识编辑方法在现有指标上表现下降，文本级指标尤其具有挑战性。

Conclusion: ScEdit基准揭示了知识编辑在实际应用中的困难，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks
remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing
methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection.
However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g.,
recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel
script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) --
which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate
token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing
existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based
("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question)
evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on
established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a
challenging task. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成长文本时的准确性，发现响应长度与事实精准度呈负相关，并提出了一个自动评价框架来验证这一现象。

Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成长文本时存在事实性错误，影响其可靠性，但响应长度对事实性的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入了一个自动且双层次的长文本事实性评估框架，进行控制实验，并验证了三种假设（错误传播、长上下文、知识耗尽）。

Result: 实验表明，长响应的事实精准度更低，且知识耗尽是导致事实性退化的主要原因。

Conclusion: 响应长度与事实精准度呈负相关，知识耗尽为主要原因，而非错误传播或长上下文。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation.
However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability.
Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on
factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form
factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human
annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct
controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual
precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon,
we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and
facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model
gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual
degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Abstract: While Ukrainian NLP has seen progress in many texts processing tasks, emotion
classification remains an underexplored area with no publicly available

dataset for emotion detection in Ukrainian texts. Our annotation schema is
adapted from the previous English-centric works on emotion detection (Mohammad

crowdsourcing using the Toloka.ai platform ensuring high-quality of the
annotation process. Then, we evaluate a range of approaches on the collected
dataset, starting from linguistic-based baselines, synthetic data translated
from English, to large language models (LLMs). Our findings highlight the
challenges of emotion classification in non-mainstream languages like Ukrainian
and emphasize the need for further development of Ukrainian-specific models and

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability
remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as
activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their
dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world
applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation
by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two
SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes
attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal
model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient
classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize
sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on
standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves
performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250
training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight,
data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in
annotation-constrained scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD) 方法，针对长文本复杂叙事和类别不平衡的问题，提出PaMA框架，利用大语言模型优化聚类与分类对齐，并在不平衡类别中平衡原型表示。实验显示PaMA性能显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有文本GCD方法在现实场景中验证不足，尤其是面对长文本和类别不平衡问题时表现不佳。

Method: 提出了PaMA框架，包括用LLM提取和优化事件模式，以及通过排序-过滤-挖掘流水线平衡类别原型表示。

Result: 在两个EC-GCD基准测试中（包括新的Scam Report数据集），PaMA比现有方法性能提升高达12.58% H-score。

Conclusion: PaMA有效解决了EC-GCD中的聚类分类对齐和类别不平衡问题，同时保持了在基础GCD数据集上的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel
categories using partially labeled data that contains only known classes.
Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual
GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce
Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and
highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1)
divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective
criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we
propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns
for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining
pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced
categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed
Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to
12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD
datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将置信度估计建模为分类任务，并引入新的损失函数KWOCCE，提高了自动作文评分（AES）的可靠性，使系统能够在高置信度下释放分数，显著提升CEFR一致性。

Motivation: 解决自动作文评分（AES）中分数可靠性的伦理挑战，确保仅在高可靠性标准下释放分数。

Method: 将置信度估计建模为分类任务，并通过分数分箱和引入新颖的KWOCCE损失函数来利用评分领域的顺序结构。

Result: 最佳模型F1分数为0.97，系统能够以100%和至少95%的CEFR一致性分别释放47%和99%的分数，显著优于独立AES模型的92%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了AES系统的可靠性，使其能够在高置信水平下释放更多分数。

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that
scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence
modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the
form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame
confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an
AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level.
While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the
scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary
classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel
Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that
incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model
achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores
with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to
approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where
we release all AM predicted scores.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出PRO方法，通过改进DPO的损失函数解决直接对齐方法中的‘似然不确定’问题，适用于多种反馈类型，实验证明其优越性。

Motivation: 现有直接对齐方法（如DPO）虽然能优化语言模型以匹配偏好，但会降低示例响应的绝对似然，导致模型输出偏离预期模式（如奖励黑客效应）。‘似然不确定’问题暴露了对比对齐的根本局限。

Method: 1. 理论分解DPO损失函数，发现标准实现隐式简化了正则项；2. 提出PRO方法，通过完整正则项的高效逼近消除似然不确定问题，支持多样化反馈（成对、二元、标量）。

Result: PRO在成对、二元及标量反馈场景中均优于现有方法，有效解决了似然不确定问题。

Conclusion: PRO通过重构损失函数和完整正则项，统一了对齐多样化反馈的框架，为直接对齐方法的理论理解和实践改进提供了新方向。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by
contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While
effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are
frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses.
As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the
expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward
model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in
contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.
In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal
direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a
decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability
to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the
underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard
DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated
loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the
underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized
PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback
types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient
approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the
superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,
binary and scalar feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该立场论文提出了一种中间观点，认为大语言模型（LLMs）通过上下文指导的外推从训练数据中提取信息，其推理能力虽然超越了随机模仿，但可预测且可控，并非类似人类高级认知能力，从而缓解了对不可控智能涌现的担忧，并建议未来研究应聚焦于上下文指导外推与训练数据的互动。

Motivation: 论文旨在纠正对大语言模型能力的极端观点（如“随机鹦鹉”或具有不可预测的“涌现”高级推理能力），提出更现实的中间立场，以指导更有效的研究方向。

Method: 通过文献综述和理论分析，提出“上下文指导外推”机制，解释LLMs如何从训练数据中提取并利用信息。

Result: 研究证实LLMs的推理能力是可预测、可控的，且不会无限扩展，否定了其具备类似人类高级认知能力或不可控智能涌现的假设。

Conclusion: 未来研究应聚焦于上下文指导外推的机制及其与训练数据的互动，探索不依赖LLMs固有高级推理能力的增强技术。

Abstract: In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM
capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either
"stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning
capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an
existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors
from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning
enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate.
We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated
though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond
stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not
indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in
humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result,
fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research
advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed
extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable
capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting
techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 提升过程奖励模型（PRMs）在token级别的信用分配准确性，解决生成模型与奖励模型之间的冲突问题。

Method: 提出Q-RM模型，通过优化判别策略学习token级Q函数，独立于语言生成任务。

Result: Q-RM在数学推理任务中表现优于基线方法，Pass@1分数显著提升，训练效率提高12倍。

Conclusion: Q-RM是一种高效且稳定的token级奖励建模方法，适用于增强LLM在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to
outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as
a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning
tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level
granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative
models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.
However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling
may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address
this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward
modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through
the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model
(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level
Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.
In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across
various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms,
Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical
reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared
to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM
significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times
faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code

Motivation: 研究动机是通过LLM生成的思维链（CoTs）更好地理解和解释人类标签变异现象。

Method: 采用了一种新型的LLM管道，结合语言导向的段落分割器从CoTs中提取支持或反对每个选项的陈述，并设计了基于排名的评估框架。

Result: 在三个数据集上，该方法优于直接生成方法和基线模型，并显示出更好的与人类标签排名的对齐性。

Conclusion: 通过改进的CoT提取和评估框架，该方法有效提升了人类标签变异分析的准确性和解释性。

Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which
generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted
significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into
human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple
annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that
LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label
distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations
based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that
may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the
answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with
linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing
statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also
propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of
answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label
distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as
baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with
humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的应用日益广泛，其内置的安全和伦理约束成为攻击者的目标。论文旨在揭示并利用LLMs在理解能力上的弱点，以测试和改进其安全性。

Method: 提出一种基于语义理解能力的分类框架，将LLMs分为Type I和Type II两类，并为每类设计定制化的越狱策略。

Conclusion: 论文证明LLMs的语义理解能力是其安全性的关键弱点，自适应越狱策略是测试和改进其安全性的有效方法。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking
techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical
constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks
compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their
comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of
jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of
understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking
Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language
Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II
categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each
category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their
vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments
conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly
improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an
exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

Result: 测试提示可以显著缓解微调数据的不足，ICL在知识提取中起主导作用。

Conclusion: ICL能有效补偿微调数据的缺陷，需重新评估其在微调数据选择方法中的作用。

Abstract: Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge
parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream
tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised
fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its
mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic
experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when
fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap
can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD)
settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e.,
few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon
theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the
test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data
and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed
light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt,
demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in
fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL
prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data
selection methods.

Motivation: 探讨大规模S2T训练中现有线性学习率预热策略的不足，验证更优预热方式对模型收敛和性能的影响。

Method: 比较不同学习率预热策略（如双线性预热和子指数预热）在大规模S2T训练中的效果。

Result: 子指数LR预热更适合大规模S2T训练；高初始LR加速收敛但未改善最终性能。

Conclusion: 大规模S2T训练需采用子指数LR预热策略，高初始LR对最终性能无增益。

Abstract: Training large-scale models presents challenges not only in terms of resource
requirements but also in terms of their convergence. For this reason, the
learning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.
Such a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)
trainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer
architecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their
better performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of
the LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating
it to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in
practice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on
the final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper
fills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a
sub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates
initial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的数据集UAQFact，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）在处理不可回答问题（UAQ）时利用内部和外部事实知识的能力。实验结果显示，即使LLMs具备相关知识，其表现仍不稳定，且外部知识的引入效果有限。

Motivation: 当前用于评估LLMs处理不可回答问题（UAQ）的数据集缺乏事实知识支持，限制了评估LLMs利用事实知识的能力。因此，作者提出新的数据集UAQFact以填补这一空白。

Method: 构建双语数据集UAQFact，基于知识图谱提供辅助事实知识，并定义两项新任务来分别评估LLMs利用内部和外部事实知识的能力。

Result: 实验表明，UAQFact对LLMs提出了显著挑战，即使具备相关知识，LLMs表现仍不稳定；外部知识虽能部分提升性能，但无法充分发挥作用。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理不可回答问题时利用事实知识的能力有限，需进一步优化知识整合机制。

Abstract: Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps
prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have
built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack
factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to
utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,
we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset
with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on
UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize
internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results
across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,
as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge
stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance
performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may
result in incorrect responses.

Result: 6个模型通过考试，但干扰使准确率最高降低20.4%，开源模型表现下降更显著。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在当前考试问题表现良好，但对干扰信息脆弱，需开发增强鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological
Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to
prepare for written board examinations. Recently, these questions have also
served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical
knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs
on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the
inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted
using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery
board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study
introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The
framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing
polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to
determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on
standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing
outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing
threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model
architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model
failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical
open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to
proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current
LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam
questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting
information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel
mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text
distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有研究表明大型语言模型在长链推理中表现出过度思考现象，即在达到正确答案后仍进行不必要的推理步骤。本文旨在从自我怀疑的角度定量分析这一问题，并提出解决方案。

Method: 论文引入了一种提示方法：首先让模型质疑输入问题的有效性，然后基于评估结果简洁回答。实验在三个数学推理任务和四个缺失前提的数据集上进行。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著减少了答案长度，并在四个广泛使用的RLLMs上对几乎所有数据集实现了性能提升，同时有效减少了推理步骤和自我怀疑。

Conclusion: 通过定量分析和简单提示方法，论文成功减少了大型语言模型的过度思考问题，提升了推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on complex tasks, largely due to the adoption of Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning. However, they often exhibit overthinking
-- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct
answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking
through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a
quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt,
characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct
answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In
response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the
model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt.
Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input
question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation.
Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with
missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer
length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4
widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by
discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the
characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction
between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored.
We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness
using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New
analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and
word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size
is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a
resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and
syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at
lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but
that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks
where they are beneficial.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了KGQAGen框架，通过结合结构化知识、LLM引导生成和符号验证，解决了现有KGQA数据集的质量问题，并构建了一个新的高质量基准KGQAGen-10k。实验表明，现有先进模型在这一基准上表现不佳，突显了其评估能力。

Motivation: 现有的KGQA数据集（如WebQSP和CWQ）存在标注不准确、问题构建模糊或无法回答、知识过时或不一致等问题。手动审计发现平均事实正确率仅为57%，因此需要一种系统化的方法提升数据质量。

Method: KGQAGen框架结合了结构化知识基础、LLM引导生成和符号验证，以生成具有挑战性且可验证的QA实例。

Result: 基于KGQAGen构建的KGQAGen-10k基准测试表明，即使是当前最先进的KG-RAG模型也表现不佳，验证了该基准的严格性。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁更严格的基准构建方法，并将KGQAGen定位为一种可扩展的框架，以推动KGQA评估的进步。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了用于SemEval-2025 Task 6（PromiseEval）的三种模型架构，旨在解决企业ESG报告中的承诺验证问题。通过逐步优化模型，最终结合子任务的方法取得了优于基线的表现。

Motivation: 企业ESG报告中的承诺验证是一个复杂且重要的任务，但现有的方法在处理多子任务时存在不足。作者希望通过探索不同的模型架构提升验证效果。

Method: 使用三种模型架构：1) 基于ESG-BERT的任务特定分类器；2) 结合语言特征的增强架构；3) 结合子任务的注意力池化和多目标学习模型。

Result: 在ML-Promise数据集上测试，结合子任务的模型取得了0.5268的分数，优于基线0.5227。

Conclusion: 研究表明，语言特征提取、注意力池化和多目标学习能有效提升承诺验证任务的效果，尽管面临类别不平衡和训练数据有限的挑战。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the SemEval-2025 Task~6 (PromiseEval),
which focuses on verifying promises in corporate ESG (Environmental, Social,
and Governance) reports. We explore three model architectures to address the
four subtasks of promise identification, supporting evidence assessment,
clarity evaluation, and verification timing. Our first model utilizes ESG-BERT
with task-specific classifier heads, while our second model enhances this
architecture with linguistic features tailored for each subtask. Our third
approach implements a combined subtask model with attention-based sequence
pooling, transformer representations augmented with document metadata, and
multi-objective learning. Experiments on the English portion of the ML-Promise
dataset demonstrate progressive improvement across our models, with our
combined subtask approach achieving a leaderboard score of 0.5268,
outperforming the provided baseline of 0.5227. Our work highlights the
effectiveness of linguistic feature extraction, attention pooling, and
multi-objective learning in promise verification tasks, despite challenges
posed by class imbalance and limited training data.

Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法仅依赖答案正确性或一致性，忽略了回答的内在逻辑连贯性，限制了模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出概率一致性偏好优化（PCPO）框架，结合答案正确性和token级概率一致性作为偏好选择标准。

Conclusion: PCPO通过双重指标优化显著提升了模型的数学推理能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in preference optimization have demonstrated significant
potential for improving mathematical reasoning capabilities in large language
models (LLMs). While current approaches leverage high-quality pairwise
preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or
consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of
responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference
Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative
metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2)
intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive
experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only
criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses the remarkable translation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exploring potential causes like incidental bilingualism and instruction tuning, and proposes a duality hypothesis for their origins.

Motivation: The paper seeks to understand why LLMs, despite not being trained specifically for translation, exhibit strong translation capabilities. It investigates underlying mechanisms such as incidental bilingualism and the role of instruction tuning.

Method: The author reflects on recent studies and user experiences to hypothesize that LLMs' translation abilities stem from two types of pre-training data. The paper also considers empirical testing of this duality hypothesis.

Result: The reflection suggests that LLMs may leverage semantically similar monolingual content from diverse sources, proposing a duality in how translation abilities are internalized during pre-training.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by advocating for further empirical testing of the duality hypothesis and rethinking translation concepts in the context of deep learning advancements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things,
demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and
few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs
are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their
remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental
bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning
contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically
identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the
internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some
reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user
experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate
in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the
models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality"
hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation,
human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Motivation: 理解对齐语言模型中拒绝行为的内在机制，以提高模型的安全性和透明度。

Conclusion: 通过激活层面的细粒度分析，揭示了拒绝行为的机制，为模型安全性和对抗性技术的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Refusal is a key safety behavior in aligned language models, yet the internal
mechanisms driving refusals remain opaque. In this work, we conduct a
mechanistic study of refusal in instruction-tuned LLMs using sparse
autoencoders to identify latent features that causally mediate refusal
behaviors. We apply our method to two open-source chat models and intervene on
refusal-related features to assess their influence on generation, validating
their behavioral impact across multiple harmful datasets. This enables a
fine-grained inspection of how refusal manifests at the activation level and
addresses key research questions such as investigating upstream-downstream
latent relationship and understanding the mechanisms of adversarial
jailbreaking techniques. We also establish the usefulness of refusal features
in enhancing generalization for linear probes to out-of-distribution
adversarial samples in classification tasks. We open source our code in

TL;DR: 该研究评估了不同大型语言模型（LLMs）在零样本设置下识别YouTube阴谋论视频的表现，发现文本模型召回率高但精确度低，而多模态模型表现较差。RoBERTa基线模型在未标注数据集上接近更大参数量的LLMs，突显了现有方法的局限。

Motivation: YouTube作为全球领先平台，容易传播有害内容（如虚假信息和阴谋论），因此需要有效的内容检测方法。

Method: 利用标注的视频数据集，在零样本环境下测试多种LLMs（文本和多模态），并与微调的RoBERTa基线对比。

Result: 文本LLMs召回率高但精确度低，多模态模型表现不佳；RoBERTa在实际未标注数据上表现接近大参数LLMs。

Conclusion: 当前LLM方法在有害内容检测中存在局限性，需开发更精确、鲁棒的系统。

Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive
reach also makes it susceptible to hosting harmful content, including
disinformation and conspiracy theories. This study explores the use of
open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for
identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled
dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot
setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results
show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to
increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only
counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To
assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an
unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with
a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content
detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.

TL;DR: 小参数语言模型（如32B）在真实软件开发任务中表现较差，现有方法成本高或效率低。提出进化式测试时扩展（EvoScale），通过迭代优化减少样本需求，使32B模型性能媲美大模型。

Motivation: 解决小参数量语言模型在真实软件开发任务（如GitHub问题修复）中表现不佳的问题，同时降低现有高成本方法的开销。

Method: 提出EvoScale方法，将生成视为进化过程，通过选择和突变迭代优化输出；结合强化学习训练模型自我进化，减少对外部验证器的依赖。

Result: 在SWE-Bench-Verified上，32B模型Satori-SWE-32B性能媲美或超越100B以上模型，且样本需求显著降低。

Conclusion: EvoScale为小模型高效解决复杂任务提供了可行方案，降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but
struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub
issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While
smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational
cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches
primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is
expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating
multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.
Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly
scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time
Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an
evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and
mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring
regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To
reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model
to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on
external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the
scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on
SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or
exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few
samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

TL;DR: 论文首次探索了表推理任务的推理时扩展，提出了两种后训练策略：蒸馏前沿模型推理轨迹和带可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）。经过训练的7B参数模型性能匹敌GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1，并展现出强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Motivation: 探索表推理任务在推理时的扩展可能性，提升小规模模型在复杂任务中的性能。

Method: 1. 基于DeepSeek-R1生成的大规模推理轨迹数据进行蒸馏（Table-R1-SFT）；2. 设计任务相关可验证奖励函数，应用GRPO算法训练（Table-R1-Zero）。

Result: Table-R1-Zero模型在多项表推理任务中性能匹配或超越GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1，且泛化能力突出。消融实验揭示了指令微调、模型架构选择及RL训练对关键推理技能的促进作用。

Conclusion: 通过蒸馏和RLVR策略，小规模模型能高效实现高性能表推理，为资源受限场景提供解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on
table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to
enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning
traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For
distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated
by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For
RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO
algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series
models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact
verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or
exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a
7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain
datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of
instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization,
as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

TL;DR: 该论文通过线性时序逻辑的片段精确表征了固定精度Transformer的表达能力，并验证其理论框架与实证结果的一致性。

Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在实证中表现优异，但其理论表达能力尚未完全明确。之前的研究常基于理想化假设（如无限精度和硬注意力），与实际模型脱节。本研究旨在更贴近实际实现的情景（固定精度和软注意力），提供更准确的表达能力分析。

Method: 通过分析固定精度、严格未来掩码和软注意力的Transformer模型，将其表达能力映射到线性时序逻辑的特定片段（仅包含过去操作符），并与形式语言理论、自动机理论和代数中的已知类别关联。

Result: 证明这些Transformer模型与特定线性时序逻辑片段具有完全相同的表达能力。实证结果表明，模型在理论能力范围内的语言上能完美泛化，而超出能力范围的语言则无法泛化。

Conclusion: 提出的理论框架不仅统一了Transformer表达能力的理解，还通过实证验证了其准确性，为模型的边界提供了明确的理论支持。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical
success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially
understood. Prior work often relies on idealized models with assumptions --
such as arbitrary numerical precision and hard attention -- that diverge from
real-world transformers. In this work, we provide an exact characterization of
fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an
idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that
these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear
temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past
operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal
language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified
theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we
present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers
trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly
over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond
it.

TL;DR: AutoSchemaKG是一个全自动构建知识图谱的框架，无需预定义模式，利用大语言模型直接从文本中提取知识三元组并推断完整模式，显著提升了多跳QA任务表现和LLM的事实性。

Motivation: 现有知识图谱构建通常依赖预定义模式，限制了灵活性和自动化程度。AutoSchemaKG旨在通过完全自动化过程解决这一问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型从文本中提取知识三元组并推断模式，结合概念化技术将实例组织到语义类别中。处理了超过5000万份文档，构建了包含9亿+节点和59亿边的知识图谱家族ATLAS。

Result: 在多跳QA任务中优于现有基线，模式推断的语义对齐率达到95%（无需人工干预）。ATLAS证明了动态推断模式的大规模知识图谱可以有效补充LLM的参量知识。

Conclusion: AutoSchemaKG展示了全自动化构建知识图谱的可行性，动态推断的模式与人工设计模式高度一致，为LLM提供了有效补充。

Abstract: We present AutoSchemaKG, a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph
construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas. Our system
leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and
induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and
events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic
categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated
Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+
million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our
schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas
with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge
graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric

Conclusion: 该研究推动了法语NLP中性别偏见缓解技术的发展，并为其他语言的类似研究提供了参考。

Abstract: A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use
of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed
groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender
rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing
gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to
feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have
been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German,
French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to
inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.
This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting
system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. We introduce a
rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two
fine-tuned language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also
explore the use of instruct-based models to enhance the performance of our
other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves
results close to our RBS. Through this contribution, we hope to promote the
advancement of gender bias mitigation techniques in NLP for French.

Motivation: 研究LRMs在复杂任务中的推理能力是否会导致在事实寻求任务中产生更多幻觉，解决当前存在的争议。

Method: 从三个视角分析：1）全面评估LRMs的幻觉现象；2）行为分析不同训练流程对幻觉的影响；3）从模型不确定性角度探讨幻觉机制。

Result: 完整的后训练流程（冷启动SFT、可验证奖励RL）能减轻幻觉，而蒸馏或无冷启动的RL训练会引入幻觉。关键认知行为（缺陷重复、思维-答案不匹配）及模型不确定性与事实准确性的错位是主要成因。

Conclusion: LRMs的幻觉现象与训练流程、认知行为和模型不确定性密切相关，为理解这一问题提供了初步框架。

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in
solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As
these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,
whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination
in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1
reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while
OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally
raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to
hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)
We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our
analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold
start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate
their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training
without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To
explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on
hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two
critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw
Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the
same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer
fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate
the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model
uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated
with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work
provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在生成摘要时保留论证角色信息的能力，并提出了一种名为ARC的评估框架。结果表明，LLM在覆盖关键论证角色方面存在不足，尤其是在论证稀疏分布时。

Motivation: 在诸如法律等高风险领域，论证角色对文档摘要至关重要，但现有LLM是否能够充分保留这些信息尚不明确。

Method: 引入Argument Representation Coverage (ARC)框架，评估三种开源LLM生成摘要对论证角色的覆盖情况，应用于法律意见和科学文章两个领域。

Result: LLM虽能部分覆盖关键论证角色，但常遗漏重要信息，尤其是在论证稀疏分布时；同时揭示了LLM上下文窗口的位置偏差和角色特定偏好对摘要质量的影响。

Conclusion: 强调了开发更具论证意识的摘要策略的必要性，以提升LLM在关键领域中的应用效果。

Abstract: Integrating structured information has long improved the quality of
abstractive summarization, particularly in retaining salient content. In this
work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are
crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We
investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately
preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation
Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries
capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three
open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal
opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover
salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in
generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed
throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns --
specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific
preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries,
emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD)，一种新的解码策略，通过强化学习优化真实性，减少大语言模型的幻觉问题。

Motivation: 现有解码方法虽然在提高大语言模型（LLMs）的事实性方面有所改进，但在长文本生成中仍容易出现幻觉问题，需要更有效的解码策略。

Method: ActLCD将解码建模为序列决策问题，利用强化学习策略和奖励感知分类器，动态选择对比层以优化生成的真实性。

Result: 实验证明ActLCD在五个基准测试中优于现有方法，有效减少了多种生成场景下的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: ActLCD通过层级对比和强化学习显著提升LLMs的事实性，展示了在解码策略中的优越性。

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language
models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation.
These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal
representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain
prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we
propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy
that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By
casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a
reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize
factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

TL;DR: ToolHaystack benchmark evaluates LLMs' long-term tool use capabilities, revealing gaps in robustness despite strong short-term performance.

Motivation: Existing evaluations focus on short-term tool use, missing insights into long-term interactions and robustness.

Method: ToolHaystack benchmark with multi-task contexts and realistic noise in continuous conversations.

Result: Current LLMs struggle in ToolHaystack, showing gaps in long-term robustness not detected by prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: ToolHaystack highlights critical weaknesses in LLMs' long-term tool use capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in using
external tools to address user inquiries. However, most existing evaluations
assume tool use in short contexts, offering limited insight into model behavior
during realistic long-term interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce
ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term
interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks
execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation,
enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various
disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they
often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in
their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了LoLA（低秩线性注意力与稀疏缓存），通过结合滑动窗口注意力、全局稀疏缓存和循环隐藏状态，改进了线性注意力模型在长序列任务中的表现，显著提高了准确率并减少了计算资源消耗。

Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长序列时存在二次复杂度问题，线性注意力虽高效但无法精确逼近softmax注意力。论文旨在通过改进线性注意力模型来克服这一限制，并解决长上下文中的信息丢失问题。

Method: LoLA通过将过去的键值对存储为三种形式：局部滑动窗口中的近期对、全局稀疏缓存中的难以记忆对，以及线性注意力的循环隐藏状态中的通用对，从而减少了信息干扰并提高了记忆效率。

Result: 在4K上下文长度下，LoLA将基础模型的准确率从0.6%提升至97.4%，缓存大小比Llama-3.1 8B小4.6倍，并在1B和8B参数的子二次模型中展示了强大的零样本常识推理能力。

Conclusion: LoLA是一种轻量级方法，能够显著提升线性注意力模型在长序列任务中的表现，且易于在消费级GPU上实现。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用预训练自监督模型wav2vec2.0自动分类语音数据中爆破音的存在，展示了其在多语言和不同数据集中的高准确性。

Motivation: 当前语音研究中缺乏针对多变语音现象的自动标注工具，而预训练模型如wav2vec2.0在语音分类任务中表现优异。

Method: 使用wav2vec2.0模型训练自动分类爆破音存在，并在英语和日语数据集上验证其效果。

Result: 模型在不同语料库中均表现出高准确性，自动标注结果与人工标注高度一致。

Conclusion: 预训练模型为语音数据的自动标注提供了高效工具，可扩大语音研究的范围和效率。

Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the
annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many
variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised
models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech
classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We
demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify
stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust
across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of
variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations,
and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the
potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation
and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the
scope of phonetic research with relative ease.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了儿童导向语言（CDL）与维基百科数据训练的模型在多种语言和评估设置下的效果，发现CDL并无明显优势，并提出了新的测试方法FIT-CLAMS以控制频率影响。

Motivation: 验证CDL是否比成人导向文本（如维基百科）更有效训练语言模型，并探讨其在多语言和多模型设置下的普适性。

Method: 比较CDL与维基百科训练的模型，涵盖两种LM目标（掩码与因果）、三种语言（英语、法语、德语）及三个句法最小对比基准，并提出FIT-CLAMS方法控制频率影响。

Result: CDL在多数情况下表现不如维基百科模型，且未显示出更强的句法泛化能力。新方法FIT-CLAMS揭示了频率控制对评估的重要性。

Conclusion: CDL并非更优训练材料，评估句法能力需控制频率效应。

Abstract: Seminal work by Huebner et al. (2021) showed that language models (LMs)
trained on English Child-Directed Language (CDL) can reach similar syntactic
abilities as LMs trained on much larger amounts of adult-directed written text,
suggesting that CDL could provide more effective LM training material than the
commonly used internet-crawled data. However, the generalizability of these
results across languages, model types, and evaluation settings remains unclear.
We test this by comparing models trained on CDL vs. Wikipedia across two LM
objectives (masked and causal), three languages (English, French, German), and
three syntactic minimal-pair benchmarks. Our results on these benchmarks show
inconsistent benefits of CDL, which in most cases is outperformed by Wikipedia
models. We then identify various shortcomings in previous benchmarks, and
introduce a novel testing methodology, FIT-CLAMS, which uses a
frequency-controlled design to enable balanced comparisons across training
corpora. Through minimal pair evaluations and regression analysis we show that
training on CDL does not yield stronger generalizations for acquiring syntax
and highlight the importance of controlling for frequency effects when
evaluating syntactic ability.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了现有基于最终答案的指标在评估大型语言模型（LLM）数学能力时的局限性，揭示了算术计算是瓶颈，而非抽象表达。

Motivation: 评估LLM在数学应用题中的能力时，通常依赖最终答案指标，但这些指标未能区分抽象表达和算术计算的贡献。

Method: 通过在GSM8K和SVAMP数据集上对Llama-3和Qwen2.5进行分离评估，分析CoT的作用及抽象与计算的机制。

Result: 发现算术计算是主要瓶颈，CoT主要帮助计算而非抽象表达，并验证了抽象先于计算的机制。

Conclusion: 研究表明需要分离评估指标以准确衡量LLM的推理能力，并为未来改进提供方向。

Abstract: Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning
ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract
formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and
arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled
evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of
Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the
arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary
to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with
limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two
skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any
reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture
problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these
abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.
These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled
evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.

TL;DR: SocialMaze基准评测系统评估大语言模型在社会情境中的推理能力，填补了现有测评方法的不足，揭示了模型在动态交互和信息不确定性方面的表现差异，并展示了针对性微调的有效性。

Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评测大语言模型在社会推理能力（如上下文理解、心理状态推断和信息真实性评估）的框架，需更贴近真实场景的挑战性测评方法。

Method: 提出SocialMaze基准，包含深度推理、动态交互和信息不确定性三大挑战，涵盖六类任务（社交推理游戏、日常互动、数字社区平台），结合自动与人工验证。

Result: 模型在动态交互与信息整合中表现差异显著；具备强链式推理能力的模型在深层推理任务中更优；不确定性下模型表现明显下降；针对性微调可显著提升复杂社会场景中的性能。

Conclusion: SocialMaze为评估和改进大语言模型的社会推理能力提供了有效工具，未来研究可基于此优化模型设计。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded
tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social
reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social
reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'
mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,
there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively
assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often
oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to
challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze
systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic
interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across
three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and
digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to
ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary
substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate
temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning
perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;
and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we
show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly
improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly
available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/SocialMaze

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets
in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While
cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual
pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically
diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable
benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing
polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language
families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a
demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the
datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments
that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the
importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy
disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released
datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly
multilingual NLP.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估大语言模型（LLM）对输入前提的批判能力的基准PCBench，发现现有模型在识别错误前提时表现有限，并强调提升这一能力对开发可靠系统的必要性。

Motivation: 当前LLM在理想设置下表现优异，但面对有缺陷或矛盾的前提时，其推理能力不足，导致不可靠输出。因此，研究前提批判能力对提升LLM的可靠性至关重要。

Method: 作者设计了PCBench基准，涵盖四种错误类型和三种难度级别，并采用多维度评估指标，对15个代表性LLM进行了系统评估。

Result: 研究发现：(1)模型依赖显式提示识别错误；(2)批判能力与问题难度和错误类型相关；(3)推理能力与前提批判能力无显著关联；(4)错误前提导致模型过度思考，延长响应时间。

Conclusion: 论文强调提升LLM的输入有效性主动评估能力是开发可靠系统的关键，并呼吁将前提批判能力作为核心研究方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating
remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often
uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient
reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of
possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the
capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most
existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely
ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we
introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by
incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with
multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15
representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on
explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)
Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with
direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;
(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique
ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly
lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These
insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of
input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for
developing reliable, human-centric systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: DEER是一种改进ICL性能的新方法，通过利用训练标签和标记级统计，优化示例选择并纠正错误标记。

Motivation: 现有的NER任务中ICL方法通常仅基于语义相似度选择示例，而忽略训练标签，导致性能不佳。

Method: DEER采用标签引导的标记级检索器优化示例选择，并通过提示LLM重新审视易错标记进行针对性修正。

Result: 在五个NER数据集和四种LLM上，DEER表现优于现有ICL方法，接近监督微调的效果，且在低资源环境中稳健。

Conclusion: DEER显著提升了ICL在NER任务中的性能，尤其在处理未见实体和低资源场景下表现出色。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER),
demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test
instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We
introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level
statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection
with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most
informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit
error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make
targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,
DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the
performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness
on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,
failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.
Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based
agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML
tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a
novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)
exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse
actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training
on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving
training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies
varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.
Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM
for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our
7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it
achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional
cross-task generalization capabilities.

Method: 提出了SITAlign框架，在推理时最大化主要目标同时满足次要标准的阈值约束，理论推导了其次优性边界。

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集中，SITAlign在保持无害性阈值的同时，比现有方法在帮助性奖励上提高22.3%的GPT-4胜率。

Conclusion: SITAlign通过满足阈值约束的多目标对齐方法，显著提升模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the
inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing
approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they
often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded
rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing
strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable
thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing
alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the
multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while
satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide
theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based
inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance
through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the
PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while
ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4
win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on
harmlessness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ATLAS，一种高容量的长期记忆模块，解决了现代循环神经网络在长上下文理解和序列外推任务中的局限性，通过优化内存管理提升性能。

Motivation: Transformers在处理长序列时存在内存和时间复杂度的限制，而现代循环神经网络在长上下文任务中表现不佳，这促使研究提出改进方案。

Method: 提出ATLAS模块，通过优化内存容量、在线更新和内存管理，结合当前和过去令牌优化记忆，并设计了DeepTransformers架构。

Result: 在语言建模、常识推理等任务中，ATLAS性能优于Transformers和线性循环模型，尤其在长上下文任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过改进内存管理显著提升了长序列任务的性能，验证了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of
BABILong benchmark.

Abstract: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning
abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated
theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that
poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language
knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a
comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to
enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale
benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems
and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for
correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically
constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement
learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,
leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical
inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process
evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning
steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly

TL;DR: 研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）在解决复杂视觉谜题（如字谜）中的能力，发现其虽能处理简单视觉线索，但在抽象推理和文化隐喻理解上表现不佳。

Motivation: 探讨当前视觉语言模型是否具备解决需要多模态抽象、符号推理和文化语言理解的复杂视觉谜题的能力。

Method: 构建了一个手工生成和标注的多样化英文字谜基准，测试不同VLM的表现。

Result: VLM能解码简单视觉线索，但面对需要抽象推理、横向思维和视觉隐喻理解的任务时表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在复杂视觉语言任务中仍有局限，尤其是在抽象和文化相关推理方面。

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种深度递归神经网络和基于Kolmogorov-Arnold的模型在热带非洲两城市的天气预测中的表现，并提出了两种改进的TKAN变体，结果显示这些模型在不同天气指标上各有优势。

Motivation: 由于热带非洲复杂的非线性天气模式，现有预测方法难以准确预测极端天气事件，这对风险管理和经济规划造成了挑战。

Method: 研究使用LSTM、GRU、BiLSTM、BiGRU、KAN和TKAN等模型及两种改进的TKAN变体（使用GeLU和MiSH激活函数），基于2010-2024年的气象数据进行预测评估。

Result: KAN在温度预测上表现最佳（R²高达0.9998），改进的TKAN变体在低降水预测中表现更优，而传统RNN在气压预测中优于KAN类模型。

Conclusion: 基于样条的神经网络架构在高效和数据高效的天气预测中具有潜力，且改进的TKAN变体优于标准TKAN。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is crucial for managing risks and economic planning,
particularly in tropical Africa, where extreme events severely impact
livelihoods. Yet, existing forecasting methods often struggle with the region's
complex, non-linear weather patterns. This study benchmarks deep recurrent
neural networks such as $\texttt{LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU}$, and
Kolmogorov-Arnold-based models $(\texttt{KAN} and \texttt{TKAN})$ for daily
forecasting of temperature, precipitation, and pressure in two tropical cities:
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Kigali (Rwanda). We further introduce
two customized variants of $ \texttt{TKAN}$ that replace its original
$\texttt{SiLU}$ activation function with $ \texttt{GeLU}$ and \texttt{MiSH},
respectively. Using station-level meteorological data spanning from 2010 to
2024, we evaluate all the models on standard regression metrics. $\texttt{KAN}$
achieves temperature prediction ($R^2=0.9986$ in Abidjan, $0.9998$ in Kigali,
$\texttt{MSE} < 0.0014~^\circ C ^2$), while $\texttt{TKAN}$ variants minimize
absolute errors for precipitation forecasting in low-rainfall regimes. The
customized $\texttt{TKAN}$ models demonstrate improvements over the standard
$\texttt{TKAN}$ across both datasets. Classical \texttt{RNNs} remain highly
competitive for atmospheric pressure ($R^2 \approx 0.83{-}0.86$), outperforming
$\texttt{KAN}$-based models in this task. These results highlight the potential
of spline-based neural architectures for efficient and data-efficient
forecasting.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have garnered significant attention and
demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications. However,
due to their enormous computational costs, the deployment and application of
LLMs are often severely limited. To address this issue, structured pruning is
an effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the
importance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are
critical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In
this paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named
SlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we
evaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely
aggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This
approach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among
elements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear
regression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance. We
also propose layer-based importance ratio to determine the pruning ratio for
each layer. Based on the LLaMA benchmark results, our SlimLLM outperforms other
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MoRE通过联合训练低秩专家，有效提升了多任务场景中LLMs的适应性和效率。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant
attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer
parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters
and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty
of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these
methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA
modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of
LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in
this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for
multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each
task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we
named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to
select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank
experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task
benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE
significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and
incurs no additional inference cost. We also release the model and code to
facilitate the community.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face significant challenges in optimizing order
dispatching and driver repositioning operations in dynamic urban environments.
Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based
heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness,
interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these
gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in
ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1)
Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by
considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2)
Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver
income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning,
which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and
projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for
ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly
outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to
anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is
the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR
tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language
models within intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了神经进化（NE）在跨任务技能迁移中的潜力，通过引入两个基准测试，表明NE方法在技能迁移方面常优于强化学习（RL），并支持NE作为构建适应性更强代理的基础。

Motivation: 探索神经进化（NE）在技能迁移中的能力，以解决强化学习（RL）在任务变化和灾难性遗忘中的脆弱性问题。

Method: 引入两个基准测试：a) 模拟逻辑电路的步进门任务，强调模块化重复和变化；b) 扩展Brax物理引擎的Ecorobot任务，支持不同机器人形态的切换。使用课程学习评估技能迁移能力。

Result: NE方法在技能迁移方面表现优于RL基线，展示了其作为适应性代理基础的潜力。

Conclusion: NE在复杂任务中具有适应性潜力，但也面临实际应用扩展的挑战。

Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a
hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial
systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in
high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task
variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained
attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima.
In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer
learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping
gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs
that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax
physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to
easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both
benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill
transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows
that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL
baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for
building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE
to complex, real-world problems.

Result: 在视觉和文本任务上实现了无数据和训练的微调知识转移。

Conclusion: 方法有效且无需数据或训练，为模型更新提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models
developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is
updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the
fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining.
This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new
release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning
to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do
so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight
permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model,
often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin
for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual
connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a
two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention
heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads.
Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the
seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without
relying on a single training step or datapoint. Code is available at

Conclusion: RaCO-DP有效地解决了差分隐私下的约束优化问题，为可信机器学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: Many problems in trustworthy ML can be formulated as minimization of the
model error under constraints on the prediction rates of the model for
suitably-chosen marginals, including most group fairness constraints
(demographic parity, equality of odds, etc.). In this work, we study such
constrained minimization problems under differential privacy (DP). Standard DP
optimization techniques like DP-SGD rely on the loss function's decomposability
into per-sample contributions. However, rate constraints introduce inter-sample
dependencies, violating the decomposability requirement. To address this, we
develop RaCO-DP, a DP variant of the Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA)
algorithm which solves the Lagrangian formulation of rate constraint problems.
We demonstrate that the additional privacy cost of incorporating these
constraints reduces to privately estimating a histogram over the mini-batch at
each optimization step. We prove the convergence of our algorithm through a
novel analysis of SGDA that leverages the linear structure of the dual
parameter. Finally, empirical results on learning under group fairness
constraints demonstrate that our method Pareto-dominates existing private
learning approaches in fairness-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led
to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for

utilization, targeting the large-batch training and inference settings.
However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch
overheads contribute are significant factors, remains important for many
applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive
applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, a proof-of-concept kernel for
accelerating single-batch inference for transformer-based large language
models. Across various model sizes and quantizations settings, we observe
nontrivial speedups compared to existing state-of-the-art inference kernels.

TL;DR: 总结：本文提出了一种利用测试时间增强（TTA）技术来减少保形分类器预测集大小的方法，实验证明该方法在不需重新训练模型的情况下，能够有效降低预测集大小，提升分类器的实用性和效率。

Motivation: 动机：保形分类器虽然能提供概率性保证，但其预测集通常过大，缺乏信息量。为了解决这一问题，作者探索了测试时间增强技术在缩小预测集方面的潜力。

Method: 方法：通过测试时间增强（TTA）引入归纳偏差，结合无需模型再训练的特点，灵活应用于保形分类器，降低预测集大小。

Result: 结果：实验覆盖三个数据集、三种模型和两种保形评分方法，显示TTA能使预测集大小平均减少10%-14%，并且在不同分布偏移下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 结论：测试时间增强是一个有效、灵活且计算高效的提升保形分类器性能的方法，特别适合实际应用中减少预测集大小的需求。

Abstract: A conformal classifier produces a set of predicted classes and provides a
probabilistic guarantee that the set includes the true class. Unfortunately, it
is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large
sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that
introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets
produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally
efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires
no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We
conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models,
two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and
several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a
useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

Abstract: The idea of value-aware model learning, that models should produce accurate
value estimates, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning.
The MuZero loss, which penalizes a model's value function prediction compared
to the ground-truth value function, has been utilized in several prominent
empirical works in the literature. However, theoretical investigation into its
strengths and weaknesses is limited. In this paper, we analyze the family of
value-aware model learning losses, which includes the popular MuZero loss. We
show that these losses, as normally used, are uncalibrated surrogate losses,
which means that they do not always recover the correct model and value
function. Building on this insight, we propose corrections to solve this issue.
Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between the loss calibration, latent
model architectures, and auxiliary losses that are commonly employed when
training MuZero-style agents. We show that while deterministic models can be
sufficient to predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models is
still advantageous.

Abstract: Powerful machine learning (ML) models are now readily available online, which
creates exciting possibilities for users who lack the deep technical expertise
or substantial computing resources needed to develop them. On the other hand,
this type of open ecosystem comes with many risks. In this paper, we argue that
the current ecosystem for open ML models contains significant supply-chain
risks, some of which have been exploited already in real attacks. These include
an attacker replacing a model with something malicious (e.g., malware), or a
model being trained using a vulnerable version of a framework or on restricted
or poisoned data. We then explore how Sigstore, a solution designed to bring
transparency to open-source software supply chains, can be used to bring
transparency to open ML models, in terms of enabling model publishers to sign
their models and prove properties about the datasets they use.

representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space.
In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as
dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that
autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold,
derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any
additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce
inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this
vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field
as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the
properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i)
analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even
throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's
parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii)
identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector
field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing
the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence in safety- and
security-critical applications demands effective neural network certification.
A challenging real-world use case is certification against ``patch attacks'',
where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for
example traffic signs. One approach to certification, which also gives
quantitative coverage estimates, utilizes preimages of neural networks, i.e.,
the set of inputs that lead to a specified output. However, these preimage
approximation methods, including the state-of-the-art PREMAP algorithm,
struggle with scalability. This paper presents novel algorithmic improvements
to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved
branching heuristics. We demonstrate efficiency improvements of at least an
order of magnitude on reinforcement learning control benchmarks, and show that
our method scales to convolutional neural networks that were previously
infeasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of preimage approximation
methodology for reliability and robustness certification.

Conclusion: CLUE是一种高效、通用的不确定性校准方法，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is critical for deploying neural networks
(NNs) in real-world applications. While existing calibration techniques often
rely on post-hoc adjustments or coarse-grained binning methods, they remain
limited in scalability, differentiability, and generalization across domains.
In this work, we introduce CLUE (Calibration via Learning Uncertainty-Error
Alignment), a novel approach that explicitly aligns predicted uncertainty with
observed error during training, grounded in the principle that well-calibrated
models should produce uncertainty estimates that match their empirical loss.
CLUE adopts a novel loss function that jointly optimizes predictive performance
and calibration, using summary statistics of uncertainty and loss as proxies.
The proposed method is fully differentiable, domain-agnostic, and compatible
with standard training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on vision,
regression, and language modeling tasks, including out-of-distribution and
domain-shift scenarios, we demonstrate that CLUE achieves superior calibration
quality and competitive predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art
approaches without imposing significant computational overhead.

Conclusion: 数据集质量是独立的性能相关因素，可作为优化分类的目标。

Abstract: In the universal quest to optimize machine-learning classifiers, three
factors -- model architecture, dataset size, and class balance -- have been
shown to influence test-time performance but do not fully account for it.
Previously, evidence was presented for an additional factor that can be
referred to as dataset quality, but it was unclear whether this was actually a
joint property of the dataset and the model architecture, or an intrinsic
property of the dataset itself. If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and
independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the
same datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other
factors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each
controlled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a
wide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to
deep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by
subset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic
property of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model
architecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an
emergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets'
constituent classes. Thus, quality joins size, class balance, and model
architecture as an independent correlate of performance and a separate target
for optimizing machine-learning-based classification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Conclusion: PGLearn通过标准化和开放的工具与数据，推动了机器学习在最优潮流问题研究中的民主化和创新。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have
recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of
leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex
optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased
volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However,
progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and
benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are
representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both
global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first
time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition,
it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone
formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize
access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair
comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for
training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with
the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting
open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at
democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning
applications for optimal power flow problems. Datasets are available for

Conclusion: 扩散模型的鲁棒性提升源于输入空间压缩，研究为设计更有效的对抗净化系统提供指导。

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical
adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed,
the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve
adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly
increase, rather than decrease, the $\ell_p$ distance to clean
samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to
the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily
influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression
effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this
observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the
improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than
prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining
robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the
input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator
without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights
into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance
for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition affecting over 48.9 million people
globally and causing 11 million deaths annually. Despite medical advancements,
predicting sepsis remains a challenge due to non-specific symptoms and complex
pathophysiology. The SXI++ LNM is a machine learning scoring system that

performance was assessed against unseen test data, and accuracy, precision, and
area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. THE SXI++ LNM outperformed the
state of the art in three use cases, achieving an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI:
0.98-1.00). The model demonstrated a precision of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.8-100.0)
and an accuracy of 99.99% (95% CI: 99.98-100.0), maintaining high reliability.

Conclusion: 即使是简单的正则化方法（无需额外学习）也能显著缓解记忆问题，并提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling,
yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their
learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples
are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as
a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is
asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit
makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial
correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical
score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one
generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same
effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent
memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better
variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data
distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be
reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential
Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two
regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial
Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a
second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along
the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any
learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization.
Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic
and MNIST datasets.

Abstract: Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics
make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to
iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects
in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method
that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a
Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next
action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning
benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring
fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies,
including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We
find that Causal-PIK remains competitive on tasks that are very challenging,
even for human problem-solvers.

Conclusion: SORL通过创新性地使用shortcut模型，成功克服了扩散和流模型在离线RL中的应用挑战，表现出高效和可扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have emerged as powerful generative approaches
capable of modeling diverse and multimodal behavior. However, applying these
models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the
iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization
difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning
(SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel
class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's
policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and
efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces
both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function
as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a
range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased
test-time compute. We release the code at

Conclusion: SPO-RC+及其改进方法在处理约束不确定性上表现优越，为CSLO问题提供了新工具。

Abstract: We study an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO)
that, in contrast to most of the existing literature, involves inequality
constraints that depend on uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning
model. To handle the constraint uncertainty, we use contextual uncertainty sets
constructed via methods like conformal prediction. Given a contextual
uncertainty set method, we introduce the "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with
Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) loss, a feasibility-sensitive adaptation of the
SPO loss that measures decision error of predicted objective parameters. We
also introduce a convex surrogate, SPO-RC+, and prove Fisher consistency with
SPO-RC. To enhance performance, we train on truncated datasets where true
constraint parameters lie within the uncertainty sets, and we correct the
induced sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques. Through
experiments on fractional knapsack and alloy production problem instances, we
demonstrate that SPO-RC+ effectively handles uncertainty in constraints and
that combining truncation with importance reweighting can further improve
performance.

TL;DR: 该论文重新审视了FTRL框架在动态环境中的表现，提出了通过乐观未来成本组合和过去成本线性化的方法，解决了FTRL在动态遗憾保证上的限制，并展示了其在贪婪与敏捷更新间权衡的优势。

Motivation: 传统FTRL框架在动态环境中因产生“懒惰”迭代而受限，论文旨在探索其实现动态遗憾保证的潜力。

Method: 通过乐观组合未来成本和线性化过去成本，并结合递归正则化（如AdaFTRL），实现状态与迭代的同步修剪。

Result: 新方法不仅恢复了已知动态遗憾界，还提供了更精细的遗憾控制、无循环依赖的乐观性，以及最小递归正则化的应用。

Conclusion: FTRL的动态性能瓶颈并非源于其投影风格，而是状态与迭代的脱节；修剪操作有效解决了这一问题。

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online
Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic
regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in
dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However,
building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we
show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic
composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can
lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic
comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile
updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret
terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal
recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not
the lazy projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but
the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates,
allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two
when necessary.

Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing
and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to
scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position
paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its
application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally
accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise
scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal
definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core
values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of
essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing
parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and
finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element
Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM
with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how
DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for
computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics
consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI
paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and
developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational
science.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文展示了一种通过非结构化稀疏性显著提升LLM中KV缓存压缩的方法，支持高达70%的稀疏率且不损失精度或需微调，通过位图稀疏格式和定制注意力内核实现解码性能提升。

Motivation: KV缓存大小是解码性能的主要瓶颈，尤其是大上下文长度下的高内存开销。为解决这一问题，作者探索了非结构化稀疏性对KV缓存的压缩潜力。

Method: 采用词令牌级基于幅度的剪枝策略，结合位图稀疏格式和定制注意力内核，实现对任意稀疏模式的压缩与直接计算。

Result: 该方法将KV缓存压缩至密集推理的45%，上下文长度和吞吐量提升至2.23倍，显著加速内存密集型解码操作。

Conclusion: 非结构化稀疏性是一种高效的无损KV缓存压缩方法，其剪枝机制与稀疏注意力内核为长上下文LLM推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache
compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising
accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of
pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly
effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing
prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier
elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple
magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the
major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large
context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a
custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over
compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly
accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby
compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom
attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial
compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer
context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to
dense inference. Our pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel is available

Abstract: Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple
domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with
some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is
accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the
memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous
approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While
these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training
is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets.
Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can
parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while
achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the
performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are
the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that
summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform
a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training
approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We
observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank
training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that
incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving
their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely
weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of
efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to
the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular
memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using
about 25% less memory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了图扩散模型（GDMs）需显式噪声级别调节的传统观点，提出并验证了去噪器可隐式推断噪声水平的假设，展示了无条件GDMs在性能、参数和计算时间上的优势。

Motivation: 当前图扩散模型依赖显式噪声级别调节，但研究者质疑这种方法的必要性，探索去噪器是否能直接从损坏的图结构中隐式推断噪声水平，以简化模型架构并提升效率。

Method: 提出基于伯努利边翻转损坏的理论框架，并扩展至结构-属性耦合噪声场景。通过合成和真实图数据集（使用GDSS、DiGress等模型）进行广泛实验验证。

Result: 无条件GDMs性能匹配或优于显式调节模型，同时减少参数（4-6%）和计算时间（8-10%），表明图数据的高维性本身已为去噪提供足够信息。

Conclusion: 去噪器可隐式学习噪声水平，支持设计更简单高效的GDM架构，为后续研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the
effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we
challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly
infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially
eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a
theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it
to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute
noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph
datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our
theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance
comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering
reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results
suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes
sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler,
more efficient GDM architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语法的方法，将DAG转换为紧凑且等效的顺序表示，解决了DAG解码的挑战。

Motivation: 由于DAG节点可能有许多不同的拓扑顺序，解码DAG一直是一个挑战。该方法旨在提供一种原则性的解决方案。

Result: 该方法生成了一个紧凑且等效的顺序表示，可用于图生成、属性预测和结构化数据的贝叶斯优化。

Conclusion: 提出的语法方法为DAG解码提供了一种原则性和有效的方式，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in
practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks,
and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it
remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of
a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a
grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent
sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as
derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique
sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a
description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a
representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph
generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the
sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured
data. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/induction.

Conclusion: 安全约束图演化为健壮、可解释的代理推理系统提供了可扩展的模块化基础。

Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow
generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to
unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework
that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph
evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable
intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable
graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e.,
crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness
while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a
high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task
settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements
in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent
reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that
safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for
robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

Conclusion: EquiReg通过正则化采样过程有效提升扩散模型在逆问题中的重建一致性和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems
such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based
inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling
process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However,
due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on
isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data
manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose
Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for
regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers.
EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and
penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new
distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that
exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold
samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling
process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms
state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image
restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种两阶段优化方法改进K-means聚类的公平性，通过微调部分数据点的聚类归属，显著提升公平性且对聚类质量影响微小。

Motivation: K-means聚类可能因敏感变量（如性别、种族）导致子群分布不公，可能引发偏见或社会问题。

Method: 两阶段优化：先聚类后调整少量选定数据点的聚类归属，并提出了两种高效算法识别对公平性影响大的数据点。

Result: 在基准数据集上实验显示，公平性显著提升且聚类质量影响极小。

Conclusion: 该方法可轻松扩展至多种聚类算法或公平性指标。

Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major
weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have
disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in
terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue
may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to
improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization
formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small
subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are
proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with
one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on
highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial
improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The
proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering
algorithms or fairness metrics.

Result: 在多个HAR数据集上实现超过80%的准确率，计算成本仅为DeepConvLSTM的约六分之一。

Conclusion: PatchEchoClassifier是一种适用于实时和低能耗的边缘计算环境中HAR任务的有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper aims to develop an energy-efficient classifier for time-series
data by introducing PatchEchoClassifier, a novel model that leverages a
reservoir-based mechanism known as the Echo State Network (ESN). The model is
designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor
signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To
train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that
transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight
reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while
significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier
requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared
to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest
that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and
energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.

TL;DR: 摘要提出了一种自适应量化算法YAQA，通过考虑全模型的KL散度，显著减少了与原始模型的分布差异，并在下游任务中表现出色。

Motivation: 传统PTQ方法独立优化每层激活误差，忽略后续层影响。YAQA旨在通过更全局的优化策略提升量化效果。

Method: 采用Kronecker分解近似每层Hessian矩阵，设计量化无关的舍入算法，具有理论保证。

Result: 实验表明，YAQA将KL散度降低约30%，并在下游任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: YAQA通过全局优化策略显著提升量化效果，适用于大规模LLM。

Abstract: The main goal of post-training quantization (PTQ) is to produced a compressed
model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as
possible. To do this tractably, almost all LLM PTQ algorithms quantize linear
layers by independently minimizing the immediate activation error. However,
this localized objective ignores the effect of subsequent layers, so reducing
it does not necessarily give a closer model. In this work, we introduce Yet
Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that uses
Kronecker-factored approximations of each linear layer's Hessian with respect
to the \textit{full model} KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components:
Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably
computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent
rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical
guarantees. Across a wide range of models and quantizers, YAQA empirically
reduces the KL divergence to the original model by $\approx 30\%$ while
achieving state of the art performance on downstream tasks.

Motivation: 为了解决无标签数据集中确定集群数量的问题，特别是在正则化k-means算法中缺乏设定λ的理论指导，论文旨在提供严谨的λ边界和正则化方法的对比分析。

Method: 通过假设集群为理想集群（d维球形，半径相同），推导出λ的严格边界，并分析了加性和乘性正则化的k-means算法。

Result: 实验表明，加性正则化的k-means算法通常会产生多个解，而乘性正则化在某些情况下能减少解的模糊性。

Conclusion: 理想集群假设下的λ边界为实际应用提供了理论支持，加性和乘性正则化的结合使用可以提高集群数量确定的准确性。

Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is
important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible
approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in
datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the
additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and
$\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines
for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper,
we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}.
Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are
close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric
distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the
k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions.
Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The
consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative
regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases.
We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the
regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

Conclusion: 权重在低维流形上的调制是一种更原则且高效的替代传统条件化的方法。

Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as
possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this
is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by
injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters
themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as
serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn
weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.
Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we
optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To
accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as
the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric
movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects
a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for
a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.
First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a
convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.
Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging
generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several
topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.
noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their
simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks
by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.
These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds
offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges
for large language models (LLMs) due to limitations in strategic depth and
adaptation to complex human factors. Existing benchmarks often fail to capture
this real-world complexity. To address this and enhance LLM capabilities in
realistic bargaining, we introduce a comprehensive framework centered on
utility-based feedback. Our contributions are threefold: (1) BargainArena, a
novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive
practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2)
human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility
theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly
reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured
feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining
strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning
(ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental
results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with
human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly
improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware
reasoning.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that remain
effective despite uncertainties in its environment, which frequently arise in
real-world applications due to variations in environment dynamics. The robust
RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case
models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are
particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and
new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive
offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific
environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect
simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training,
but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO,
the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QLIP是一种直接替换CLIP视觉编码器的方案，通过内容感知的分块方法解决了CLIP的局限性，无需重新训练即可提升多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。

Motivation: CLIP视觉编码器存在输入分辨率固定和无法区分不同图像的问题，替换成本高昂。QLIP旨在解决这些问题，并易于集成到现有模型中。

Method: 提出QLIP，基于图像四叉树和内容感知分块，替换CLIP视觉编码器。

Result: QLIP显著提升了LLaVA v1.5在视觉问答任务中的准确性，且在V*基准上详细理解性能提升达13.6%。

Conclusion: QLIP是一种高效且无需重新训练的CLIP替代方案，能显著提升多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encode images into visual tokens,
aligning visual and textual signals within a shared latent space to facilitate
crossmodal representation learning. The CLIP model is a widely adopted
foundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical
role in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision
encoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only
handling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings
for dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model
typically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often
necessitates retraining the entire model pipeline.
  In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the
CLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias. To address these
issues, we propose QLIP, a drop-in replacement for CLIP that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing MLLMs with only a few lines of code and can enhance
both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding, without re-training.
QLIP is designed around an image quadtree which replaces the standard uniform
grid patches with a novel content aware patchification. Our experimental
results demonstrate that QLIP improves the general visual question answering
accuracy of the LLaVA v1.5 model series across various model sizes--without
requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the full MLLM. Notably, QLIP boosts
detailed understanding performance on the challenging $V^{\ast}$ benchmark by
up to 13.6 percent.

TL;DR: 提出了EmergentTTS-Eval，一个自动化生成和评估复杂文本到语音（TTS）场景的基准测试，覆盖情感、复杂发音等6种挑战场景，展示其能有效区分TTS模型的性能差异。

Motivation: 现有TTS基准测试难以评估模型对复杂语义和细微差别的处理能力，因此需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过LLM扩展人工种子提示生成1,645个多样化测试用例，并采用基于LALM的模型即评委方法评估语音质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法与人类偏好高度相关，并能细粒度区分11Labs等TTS模型的性能。

Conclusion: EmergentTTS-Eval为TTS评估提供了自动化、可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了评估的全面性。

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle
nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we
introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six
challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic
complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions.
Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation,
making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of
human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target
specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645
diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a
Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple
dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation
accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems,
such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval,
demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences.
Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment
and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation

TL;DR: 通过调整初始化率和权重衰减系数控制模型复杂度，可以一致提升不同模型和数据规模下大语言模型的扩展规律性能。

Motivation: 大语言模型的推理能力快速发展，需要更基础的方法可靠提升其泛化能力。

Method: 通过调整初始化率和权重衰减系数控制模型复杂度，并与不同复杂度超参数的基准模型性能比较。

Result: 恒定初始化率使模型在规模和数据上的扩展规律下降更快，表明复杂度控制是提升大语言模型的有效方向。

Conclusion: 复杂度控制是大语言模型持续进步的有前景方向。

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly
advancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches
that can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that
model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the
initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of
LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further
illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on
1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the
initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent
of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes.
These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the
continual advancement of LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文将图神经网络的消息传递机制建模为双曲偏微分方程系统，通过特征向量描述图的拓扑结构，增强了消息传递的可解释性，并显著提升了谱图神经网络的性能。

Motivation: 传统的图神经网络（GNNs）在空间域中学习节点特征，难以确保拓扑特征的有效提取，因此需要一种能显式捕捉拓扑结构的方法。

Method: 将消息传递建模为双曲偏微分方程（PDEs）系统，节点特征在特征向量空间中分解，同时引入多项式逼近滤波器函数。

Result: 实验证明，该方法不仅灵活，还能显著提升多种谱图神经网络在不同图任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过双曲PDE系统，该方法增强了消息传递的可解释性，并为谱图神经网络提供了一种有效的增强范式。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) leverage message passing mechanisms to learn the
topological features of graph data. Traditional GNNs learns node features in a
spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological
features. In this paper, we formulates message passing as a system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs), constituting a
dynamical system that explicitly maps node representations into a particular
solution space. This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors
describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any
moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the
basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message
passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics
about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with
spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing
enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to
approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also
significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse
graph tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在短期预测中表现良好，但在长程预测（LPTSF）中存在非线性动态和误差累积的问题。为了解决这些局限性，需要一种更高效且准确的方法。

Method: $K^2$VAE 是一种基于 VAE 的生成模型，利用 KoopmanNet 将非线性时间序列转换为线性动态系统，并通过 KalmanNet 优化预测和建模不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，$K^2$VAE 在短期和长程 PTSF 中均优于现有方法，提供了更高效和准确的解决方案。

Conclusion: $K^2$VAE 通过结合 KoopmanNet 和 KalmanNet 有效解决了长程概率时间序列预测的挑战，具有高效和准确的优势。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in
decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and
transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while
overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
(LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have
a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models
inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model
that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear
dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model
uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in
long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF,
providing a more efficient and accurate solution.

TL;DR: SCORPIO 是一个面向 SLO 的 LLM 服务系统，通过自适应调度提升系统吞吐量和 SLO 达成率，优于现有基线方法。

Motivation: 当前 LLM 服务系统过于关注吞吐量而忽视 SLO 指标（如 TTFT 和 TPOT），导致 SLO 达成不理想，需要一种新系统来优化这些指标。

Method: SCORPIO 采用 TTFT Guard 进行请求重排序和拒绝不可达请求，TPOT Guard 使用基于 VBS 的准入控制和信用批处理机制，并结合预测模块。

Result: SCORPIO 将系统吞吐量提升高达 14.4 倍，SLO 达标率提升 46.5%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCORPIO 通过自适应调度解决了 LLM 服务系统中的 SLO 问题，有效提升了性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems prioritize maximum
throughput. They often neglect Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as Time to
First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT), which leads to suboptimal
SLO attainment. This paper introduces SCORPIO, an SLO-oriented LLM serving
system designed to maximize system goodput and SLO attainment for workloads
with heterogeneous SLOs. Our core insight is to exploit SLO heterogeneity for
adaptive scheduling across admission control, queue management, and batch
selection. SCORPIO features a TTFT Guard, which employs least-deadline-first
reordering and rejects unattainable requests, and a TPOT Guard, which utilizes
a VBS-based admission control and a novel credit-based batching mechanism. Both
guards are supported by a predictive module. Evaluations demonstrate that
SCORPIO improves system goodput by up to 14.4X and SLO adherence by up to 46.5%
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The Vision Language Model (VLM) excels in aligning vision and language
representations, and prompt learning has emerged as a key technique for
adapting such models to downstream tasks. However, the application of prompt
learning with VLM in federated learning (\fl{}) scenarios remains
underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral
differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning
(VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain
shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various \fl{}
and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and
prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL).
Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex
scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both
prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical
insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to
the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.

Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation
distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly
degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to
subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with
re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on
assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on
group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,
we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk
associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace
its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical
classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing
on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation
on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of
subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy. The code is

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning.
Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the
power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the
scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on
point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for
real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining
the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional
computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on
Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation.
Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of
infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws,
allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness
of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both
the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such
as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable,
uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have inspired the development of
foundation models across various domains. In this study, we evaluate the
efficacy of Large EEG Models (LEMs) by fine-tuning LaBraM, a state-of-the-art
foundation EEG model, on a real-world stress classification dataset collected
in a graduate classroom. Unlike previous studies that primarily evaluate LEMs
using data from controlled clinical settings, our work assesses their
applicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that
distinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG
data recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The
best-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a
5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in
both accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of
the fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts.
These results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process
real-world EEG data and highlight their potential to revolutionize
brain-computer interface applications by shifting the focus from model-centric

Conclusion: ProDiff以极小端点信息实现高效轨迹补全，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from
incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios.
Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information,
such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume
that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place
significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of
large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a
trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal
information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns
and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal
reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective
imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by
6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927

Conclusion: DenoiseRotator提高了剪枝鲁棒性，性能损失显著降低，与现有剪枝技术兼容。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)
by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant
performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity
constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the
importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve
critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:
rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute
parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By
minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our
approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby
enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,
which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight
matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with
existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated
on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and
zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the
dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are

TL;DR: 介绍了CDR-Agent，一种基于LLM的系统，旨在通过自动识别和应用合适的CDR（临床决策规则）来提升急诊决策效率，减少计算开销，并在两个新数据集上验证其性能。

Motivation: 急诊部门需要快速且准确的决策，但临床决策规则的应用常因医生的认知负荷而受限，因此开发了CDR-Agent以自动化这一过程。

Method: CDR-Agent基于LLM，通过分析非结构化临床笔记自主选择和应用CDR，并在合成和CDR-Bench数据集上验证其性能。

Result: CDR-Agent在CDR选择上比基线LLM分别提高了56.3%（合成）和8.7%（CDR-Bench）的准确率，显著减少了计算开销，并且在影像决策上表现优于传统LLM方法。

Conclusion: CDR-Agent能高效选择CDR并做出谨慎且有效的影像决策，适用于急诊及其他临床环境。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly
in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions
are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools
that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to
make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the
clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply
the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system
designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying
the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate
CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although
CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\%
(synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM
baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces
computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent
not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective
imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully
identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM
prompting approaches. Code for our work can be found at:

Conclusion: DINGO有效解决了扩散LLMs在约束解码上的局限性，为结构化输出任务提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional
autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime
efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably
enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which
makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as
fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This
parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are
designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true
output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic
programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and
provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with
the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while
strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic
math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point
improvement over unconstrained inference

TL;DR: CompFlow通过将目标动态建模为基于源域流的条件流，利用Wasserstein距离估计动态差异，并引入乐观主动数据收集策略，显著提升了强化学习在动态转移差异环境中的性能。

Motivation: 利用离线数据提升强化学习的样本效率常受源和目标环境动态差异的挑战，现有方法依赖KL散度或互信息估计动态差异，但这些方法在支持不重叠时可能失效。

Method: 提出CompFlow方法，基于流匹配和最优传输理论，将目标动态建模为源域流的条件流，利用Wasserstein距离估计动态差异，并采用乐观主动数据收集策略。

Result: CompFlow在多个动态偏移的RL基准测试中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CompFlow通过理论驱动的动态差异估计和主动探索策略，有效解决了动态差异环境中的强化学习问题。

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can
significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but
this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition
dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically
address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high
dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often
relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when
the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical
connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model
the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of
the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior.
This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization
for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics
gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions.
Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce
an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in
regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the
performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow
outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted
dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的去中心化联邦学习框架（DFL），利用验证损失指导模型共享和本地训练校正，显著提升了作物病害分类的准确性、收敛速度和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 作物病害检测是农业中的关键挑战，但现有深度学习模型在数据隐私和大规模部署方面存在问题。联邦学习（FL）虽能解决隐私问题，但集中式FL仍存在单点故障和可扩展性限制。

Method: 引入DFL框架，通过验证损失（Loss_val）指导模型共享，并利用加权参数控制的自适应损失函数校正本地训练。实验使用了PlantVillage数据集和三种深度学习架构（ResNet50、VGG16、ViT_B16）。

Conclusion: DFL框架特别适合隐私保护的农业应用，为解决作物病害分类中的数据隐私和部署问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Crop disease detection and classification is a critical challenge in
agriculture, with major implications for productivity, food security, and
environmental sustainability. While deep learning models such as CNN and ViT
have shown excellent performance in classifying plant diseases from images,
their large-scale deployment is often limited by data privacy concerns.
Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue, but centralized FL remains
vulnerable to single-point failures and scalability limits. In this paper, we
introduce a novel Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework that uses
validation loss (Loss_val) both to guide model sharing between peers and to
correct local training via an adaptive loss function controlled by weighting
parameter. We conduct extensive experiments using PlantVillage datasets with
three deep learning architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT_B16), analyzing the
impact of weighting parameter, the number of shared models, the number of
clients, and the use of Loss_val versus Loss_train of other clients. Results
demonstrate that our DFL approach not only improves accuracy and convergence
speed, but also ensures better generalization and robustness across
heterogeneous data environments making it particularly well-suited for
privacy-preserving agricultural applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BOGC-MML的多模态学习方法，通过贝叶斯梯度校准来显式建模梯度不确定性，优化模型更新方向。

Motivation: 现有方法通过固定权重聚合梯度，忽视各模态的梯度不确定性，可能导致敏感维度过度更新或非敏感维度更新不足。

Method: 首先将各模态梯度建模为随机变量并推导其概率分布，随后将梯度分布的精度转化为标量证据，通过Dempster-Shafer规则融合不确定性，生成校准的更新方向。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性和优势。

Conclusion: BOGC-MML通过梯度校准显著提升多模态学习的性能。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) integrates information from diverse modalities to
improve predictive accuracy. However, existing methods mainly aggregate
gradients with fixed weights and treat all dimensions equally, overlooking the
intrinsic gradient uncertainty of each modality. This may lead to (i) excessive
updates in sensitive dimensions, degrading performance, and (ii) insufficient
updates in less sensitive dimensions, hindering learning. To address this
issue, we propose BOGC-MML, a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for
MML to explicitly model the gradient uncertainty and guide the model
optimization towards the optimal direction. Specifically, we first model each
modality's gradient as a random variable and derive its probability
distribution, capturing the full uncertainty in the gradient space. Then, we
propose an effective method that converts the precision (inverse variance) of
each gradient distribution into a scalar evidence. This evidence quantifies the
confidence of each modality in every gradient dimension. Using these evidences,
we explicitly quantify per-dimension uncertainties and fuse them via a reduced
Dempster-Shafer rule. The resulting uncertainty-weighted aggregation produces a
calibrated update direction that balances sensitivity and conservatism across
dimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid framework combining LSTM (Long Short-Term
Memory) networks with LightGBM and CatBoost for stock price prediction. The
framework processes time-series financial data and evaluates performance using
seven models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), vanilla LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and
standard Neural Networks (NNs). Key metrics, including MAE, R-squared, MSE, and
RMSE, are used to establish benchmarks across different time scales.
  Building on these benchmarks, we develop an ensemble model that combines the
strengths of sequential and tree-based approaches. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework improves accuracy by 10 to 15 percent compared to
individual models and reduces error during market changes. This study
highlights the potential of ensemble methods for financial forecasting and
provides a flexible design for integrating new machine learning techniques.

Result: EST在OC20和QM9等分子基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EST通过增强非线性与完整组表示，显著提升了SE(3)-等变GNN的表达能力和实际应用效果。

Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced
molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their
message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are
limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations,
thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a
Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after
Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can
encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior
expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed
through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular
benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MAP的新框架，通过将权重矩阵重新表述为高维向量并解耦其方向与幅度调整，为参数高效微调提供了一种更严格的方法。该框架能够无缝集成现有方法，显著提升性能。

Motivation: 当前参数高效微调方法（如LoRA、DoRA）在方向定义上缺乏严格的几何基础，限制了其灵活性与解释性。MAP旨在通过数学严谨的方式解决这一问题。

Method: MAP将预训练权重归一化，学习方向性更新，并通过两个标量系数独立调整基础向量和更新向量的幅度。

Result: 实验表明，MAP能够显著提升现有PEFT方法的性能，且具有通用性和简单性。

Conclusion: MAP提供了更灵活、可解释的权重适配方法，有望成为未来PEFT方法的默认设计选择。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural
language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive,
hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,
such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to
further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components.
However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the
column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we
propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as
high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and
magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns
a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently
scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more
interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly
improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet
powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and
simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing
future PEFT methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的自适应变量邻域搜索方法（RL-AVNS），用于解决带多时间窗的车辆路径问题（VRPMTW），相比传统方法在解质量和计算效率上有显著提升。

Motivation: 传统自适应方法仅依赖历史算子性能，无法动态调整，RL-AVNS通过强化学习框架实时选择算子，提升求解效果。

Method: 结合强化学习动态选择邻域算子，引入量化顾客时间灵活性的指标改进震荡阶段，采用基于Transformer的策略网络指导局部搜索。

Conclusion: RL-AVNS在复杂物流场景中具有实用价值，能够高效处理不同规模和时间窗复杂度的问题。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive variable
neighborhood search (RL-AVNS) method designed for effectively solving the
Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Time Windows (VRPMTW). Unlike traditional
adaptive approaches that rely solely on historical operator performance, our
method integrates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically select
neighborhood operators based on real-time solution states and learned
experience. We introduce a fitness metric that quantifies customers' temporal
flexibility to improve the shaking phase, and employ a transformer-based neural
policy network to intelligently guide operator selection during the local
search. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on realistic
scenarios derived from the replenishment of unmanned vending machines,
characterized by multiple clustered replenishment windows. Results demonstrate
that RL-AVNS significantly outperforms traditional variable neighborhood search
(VNS), adaptive VNS (AVNS), and state-of-the-art learning-based heuristics,
achieving substantial improvements in solution quality and computational
efficiency across various instance scales and time window complexities.
Particularly notable is the algorithm's capability to generalize effectively to
problem instances not encountered during training, underscoring its practical
utility for complex logistics scenarios.

Conclusion: 任务相关知识是通过低维子空间注入模型的，结构感知的微调方法能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across
a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models
incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces
low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain
underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the
structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through
singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly
amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact,
suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional
subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are
reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace
remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that
leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise
modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global
structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines
across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: LUMION是一种可重构的光纤架构，用于在数据中心机架内连接加速器，动态替换故障加速器，避免资源浪费，提升性能和吞吐量。

Motivation: 现代ML数据中心在加速器故障时通常迁移整个任务至新机架，虽保持网络性能，但资源效率低下。LUMION旨在解决这一低效问题。

Method: 提出LUMION，一种动态整合备用加速器的光纤架构，通过硬件原型实现故障GPU的快速替换（约1秒）和任务重启。

Result: 实验显示，LUMION替换故障GPU后，GPU间带宽高于传统电连接机架，微调吞吐量提升近2倍。

Conclusion: LUMION显著提升了数据中心资源利用率和ML任务性能，避免了昂贵的迁移成本。

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the
affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach,
while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring
datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In
this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a
novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a
datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically
integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby
maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the
benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our
experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a
healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION
achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks
after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X
improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains
such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely
untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a
compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators
that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs --
a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this
work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator
architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO)
in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear
attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable
kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space.
As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store
large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling
spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across
diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable,
and efficient physics learning. Our code and data accompanying this paper are

Abstract: Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging
paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between
variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between
endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting.
In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model
that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play
cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the
dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly
integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures
time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying
or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in
dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements.
Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head
to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies,
further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12
real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance
in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study
underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module.
Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in
for various forecasting tasks across different domains. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 重归一化是DRM方法的关键，为合并创造了鲁棒且均匀的联合空间，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale training, model merging has evolved into a tool for
creating multitasking models efficiently. It enables the knowledge of models to
be fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional
multitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at
identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling
straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption
overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may
develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging
problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective
approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and
coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise
merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various
settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa,
encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B.
Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art
merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.
Moreover, our analysis reveals renormalization as the crucial component for
creating a robust and even joint space for merging, significantly contributing
to the method's performance.

Conclusion: Doppler框架通过结合双策略网络和专家启发式方法，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为数据流图中的操作分配提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of assigning operations in a dataflow graph to devices
to minimize execution time in a work-conserving system, with emphasis on
complex machine learning workloads. Prior learning-based methods often struggle
due to three key limitations: (1) reliance on bulk-synchronous systems like
TensorFlow, which under-utilize devices due to barrier synchronization; (2)
lack of awareness of the scheduling mechanism of underlying systems when
designing learning-based methods; and (3) exclusive dependence on reinforcement
learning, ignoring the structure of effective heuristics designed by experts.
In this paper, we propose \textsc{Doppler}, a three-stage framework for
training dual-policy networks consisting of 1) a $\mathsf{SEL}$ policy for
selecting operations and 2) a $\mathsf{PLC}$ policy for placing chosen
operations on devices. Our experiments show that \textsc{Doppler} outperforms
all baseline methods across tasks by reducing system execution time and
additionally demonstrates sampling efficiency by reducing per-episode training
time.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software
development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging
and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly
generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment --
offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs'
benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current
benchmarks often lack support for end-to-end verifiable code generation. In
this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a
high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code,
specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina
consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem
descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive
test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof
generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in
verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, generates only 61.4%
correct code, 51.0% sound and complete specifications, and 3.6% successful
proofs, with one trial per task. We hope Verina will catalyze progress in
verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark.
We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina
and our evaluation code on https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/verina.

Conclusion: 研究表明，高容量价值模型与任务嵌入结合的方法能有效解决多任务强化学习中的任务干扰问题，为通用策略训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large
models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in
value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by
small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL
sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference
brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online
training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of
single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of
high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on
learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online
RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach
on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high
degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that,
despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single
and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.

TL;DR: 研究了带偏差离线数据的最优臂识别问题，证明了无偏边界先验知识的自适应算法存在局限性，提出了LUCB-H算法，通过校正偏差平衡离线与在线数据，理论分析和实验验证其优于标准LUCB。

Motivation: 现实场景（如临床试验）中常见带偏差离线数据的最优臂识别问题，但缺乏对偏差边界先验知识的自适应算法存在理论限制。

Method: 提出LUCB-H算法，在LUCB框架中引入自适应置信边界和偏差校正机制，平衡离线与在线数据。

Result: 理论证明LUCB-H在误导性离线数据下与标准LUCB样本复杂度相当，在有益数据下显著更优；实验验证其鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: LUCB-H能有效整合偏差离线数据，为最优臂识别问题提供理论保证和实践优势。

Abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased
offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in
real-world scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result
for adaptive algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between
online and offline distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H
algorithm, which introduces adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an
auxiliary bias correction to balance offline and online data within the LUCB
framework. Theoretical analysis shows that LUCB-H matches the sample complexity
of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading and significantly outperforms
it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an instance-dependent lower
bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain scenarios. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of LUCB-H in
effectively incorporating offline data.

TL;DR: 提出了PMDG框架，通过风格迁移和数据增强从单一源域生成多伪域，解决了多源域泛化中数据集构建成本高的问题，实验证明其效果接近或优于多域性能。

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在部署时因数据分布变化导致的性能下降问题，同时降低多源域数据集构建的成本。

Conclusion: PMDG为域泛化研究提供了实用的单源域解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on
data distributions different from their training data, particularly in
real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While
Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this
challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical
application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated
with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose
Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that
enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in more practical
Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple
pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data
augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be
used with existing MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with
PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze
the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our
analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between
MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed
actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive
empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain
generalization. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法有效解决了联邦学习中低秩分解的关键问题，通过MUD、BKD、AAD的协同应用显著提升了性能。

Abstract: To improve the training efficiency of federated learning (FL), previous
research has employed low-rank decomposition techniques to reduce communication
overhead. In this paper, we seek to enhance the performance of these low-rank
decomposition methods. Specifically, we focus on three key issues related to
decomposition in FL: what to decompose, how to decompose, and how to aggregate.
Subsequently, we introduce three novel techniques: Model Update Decomposition
(MUD), Block-wise Kronecker Decomposition (BKD), and Aggregation-Aware
Decomposition (AAD), each targeting a specific issue. These techniques are
complementary and can be applied simultaneously to achieve optimal performance.
Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the
convergence of the proposed MUD. Extensive experimental results show that our
approach achieves faster convergence and superior accuracy compared to relevant
baseline methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种频率域的新方法FreRA，用于时间序列对比学习中的增强策略，优于现有基线方法。

Motivation: 现有时间序列增强方法多来自视觉领域，不适用于时间序列数据，可能损害语义信息。

Method: 基于频率域的FreRA方法，通过自动分离关键和非关键频率成分，保护语义并引入多样性。

Result: FreRA在多类任务（分类、异常检测、迁移学习）中持续优于10种基线方法。

Conclusion: FreRA提供了一种轻量级且有效的时间序列对比学习增强策略。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised
representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation
strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time
series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation
methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series
data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the
semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched
patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel
perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for
downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize
the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency
Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on
classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive
learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA
automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components.
Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and
semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant
information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the
unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates
semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale
datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading
baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer
learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive
representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios
across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了名为FSL-SAGE的新算法，解决了联合学习和拆分学习中的效率和内存问题，同时保持高准确性。

Motivation: 现有的协作训练方法如联合学习（FL）和拆分学习（SL）各自存在问题：FL需要客户端训练完整模型但难以扩展，SL虽减轻客户端内存负担但导致网络延迟。

Method: FSL-SAGE通过辅助模型估计服务器梯度反馈，减少通信成本与客户端内存需求。

Result: FSL-SAGE在收敛速率上与FedAvg相当，同时在通信效率和准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FSL-SAGE是一种高效的联邦拆分学习算法，平衡了效率与准确性。

Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split
Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data.
However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for
large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory
constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases
network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the
conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to
improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor
accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation
Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates
server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models
periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that
FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is
the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while
significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our
empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL
methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: RadarGate通过旋转操作解决了LoRA扩展中的泛化和欠拟合问题，提升了模型的表达能力和任务适应性。

Abstract: Scaling Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) facilitates
large language models (LLMs) to efficiently adapt to diverse tasks. However,
traditional gating mechanisms that route inputs to the best experts may
fundamentally hinder LLMs' scalability, leading to poor generalization and
underfitting issues. We identify that the root cause lies in the restricted
expressiveness of existing weighted-sum mechanisms, both within and outside the
convex cone of LoRA representations. This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a
novel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational
operations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate
richer feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs.
Specifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a
learnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix
involves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship
between LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an
extra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and
properly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues
as the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks
across 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We
also provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of
representations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically
similar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing
distance ones further apart. We will release our code to the community.

Motivation: 传统MPNN在处理图结构数据时，由于过压缩现象导致长程依赖难以捕捉，这与CNN中ERF利用不足的问题类似。本文旨在通过改进MPNN架构提升长程依赖表达能力。

Method: 提出了IM-MPNN，通过分层粗化图结构，实现多尺度消息传递，从而在不增加深度或参数的情况下增强长程交互。

Conclusion: IM-MPNN通过多尺度消息传递解决了MPNN的长程依赖问题，为图数据处理提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for
processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is
often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range
dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the
MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive
Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical
receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and
theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired
by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved
Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address
these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of
the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and
facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or
parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the
Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Motivation: 探讨标准LoRA层中矩阵初始化为零的做法是否有理论支持，分析非零初始化的潜在优势。

Result: 非零初始化提升了LoRA对次优学习率（尤其是较小学习率）的鲁棒性，且不影响微调性能。

Conclusion: 微调无需严格从预训练模型开始，非零初始化是可行的。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. In standard LoRA layers, one of the matrices, $A$ or $B$, is
initialized to zero, ensuring that fine-tuning starts from the pretrained
model. However, there is no theoretical support for this practice. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of non-zero initialization on LoRA's
fine-tuning dynamics from an infinite-width perspective. Our analysis reveals
that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$
to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates,
particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the
non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained
weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance. In other words,
fine-tuning does not need to strictly start from the pretrained model. The
validity of our findings is confirmed through extensive experiments across
various models and datasets. The code is available at

Motivation: 尽管TSFMs在零样本预测中表现优异，但在微调后仍无法稳定超越小型专用模型。论文旨在研究如何有效适配TSFMs以提升目标任务的预测性能。

Method: 提出了一种结构化修剪方法，通过保留任务相关的网络子结构，将微调过程集中在更相关和紧凑的参数空间上。

Conclusion: “修剪后微调”的范式能够帮助TSFMs实现最先进的性能，并超越专用模型，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models
(TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot
forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot
consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot
downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs
for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the
pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in
computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant
network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve
this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to
regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant
and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six
benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly
improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This
"prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

Method: 通过微调一组扰动模型，并计算这些模型上示例损失的协方差作为数据属性评分。

Result: Daunce在视觉任务和大语言模型微调中表现出色，适用于黑盒模型，并首次在GPT等专有模型上实现了数据属性分析。

Conclusion: Daunce是一种简单而有效的数据属性方法，适用于大规模应用，且准确性高，兼容性强。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to identify which training
examples influence a model's predictions on specific test data most. By
quantifying these influences, TDA supports critical applications such as data
debugging, curation, and valuation. Gradient-based TDA methods rely on
gradients and second-order information, limiting their applicability at scale.
While recent random projection-based methods improve scalability, they often
suffer from degraded attribution accuracy. Motivated by connections between
uncertainty and influence functions, we introduce Daunce - a simple yet
effective data attribution approach through uncertainty estimation. Our method
operates by fine-tuning a collection of perturbed models and computing the
covariance of per-example losses across these models as the attribution score.
Daunce is scalable to large language models (LLMs) and achieves more accurate
attribution compared to existing TDA methods. We validate Daunce on tasks
ranging from vision tasks to LLM fine-tuning, and further demonstrate its
compatibility with black-box model access. Applied to OpenAI's GPT models, our
method achieves, to our knowledge, the first instance of data attribution on
proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: $\\varepsilon$-VCP可作为量化过拟合的实用指标，为模型设计提供理论指导。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between model generalization
and counterfactual explainability in supervised learning. We introduce the
notion of $\varepsilon$-valid counterfactual probability ($\varepsilon$-VCP) --
the probability of finding perturbations of a data point within its
$\varepsilon$-neighborhood that result in a label change. We provide a
theoretical analysis of $\varepsilon$-VCP in relation to the geometry of the
model's decision boundary, showing that $\varepsilon$-VCP tends to increase
with model overfitting. Our findings establish a rigorous connection between
poor generalization and the ease of counterfactual generation, revealing an
inherent trade-off between generalization and counterfactual explainability.
Empirical results validate our theory, suggesting $\varepsilon$-VCP as a
practical proxy for quantitatively characterizing overfitting.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉复杂非线性关联并优化空间对齐。

Abstract: The rapid growth in feature dimension may introduce implicit associations
between features and labels in multi-label datasets, making the relationships
between features and labels increasingly complex. Moreover, existing methods
often adopt low-dimensional linear decomposition to explore the associations
between features and labels. However, linear decomposition struggles to capture
complex nonlinear associations and may lead to misalignment between the feature
space and the label space. To address these two critical challenges, we propose
innovative solutions. First, we design a random walk graph that integrates
feature-feature, label-label, and feature-label relationships to accurately
capture nonlinear and implicit indirect associations, while optimizing the
latent representations of associations between features and labels after
low-rank decomposition. Second, we align the variable spaces by leveraging
low-dimensional representation coefficients, while preserving the manifold
structure between the original high-dimensional multi-label data and the
low-dimensional representation space. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on seven benchmark datasets and three representative datasets
using various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method\footnote{Code: https://github.com/Heilong623/-GRW-}.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了随机策略和确定性策略在连续控制中的策略梯度关系，证明在特定MDP家族中两者梯度及状态价值函数相同，并提出了一种构建等价MDP的方法。

Motivation: 探讨随机策略与确定性策略在连续控制中的梯度关系，以统一策略梯度方法。

Method: 在涉及高斯控制噪声和二次控制成本的MDP家族中分析随机和确定性策略的梯度、自然梯度及价值函数；提出构建等价MDP的通用方法。

Result: 证明在特定MDP中随机与确定性策略的梯度、自然梯度和状态价值函数相同，但状态-控制价值函数不同；成功构建等价MDP。

Conclusion: 通过近似状态价值函数而非状态-控制价值函数，可以统一策略梯度方法。

Abstract: Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic
and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In
a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic
control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients,
natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the
state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general
procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent
to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the
sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results
suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state
value functions rather than state-control value functions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对去中心化联邦学习（DFL）的参与者贡献评估方法DFL-Shapley及其近似计算版本DFL-MR，填补了现有贡献评估方法仅适用于中心化联邦学习（CFL）的空白。

Motivation: 在DFL中，由于缺乏中心服务器和存在多个全局模型，现有CFL贡献评估方法无法直接应用，需开发新方法以实现透明激励。

Method: 提出DFL-Shapley（基于Shapley值的DFL扩展）和DFL-MR（计算可行的近似方法，通过累积轮级Shapley值估计总贡献）。

Result: 实验验证DFL-Shapley作为真实基准的有效性，并证明DFL-MR在不同场景下与DFL-Shapley高度接近。

Conclusion: DFL-Shapley与DFL-MR是DFL中有效的贡献评估指标，解决了去中心化环境下的挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
models without sharing their data. Measuring participant contributions in FL is
crucial for incentivizing clients and ensuring transparency. While various
methods have been proposed for contribution measurement, they are designed
exclusively for centralized federated learning (CFL), where a central server
collects and aggregates client models, along with evaluating their
contributions. Meanwhile, decentralized federated learning (DFL), in which
clients exchange models directly without a central server, has gained
significant attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating
a single point of failure. However, applying existing contribution measurement
methods to DFL is challenging due to the presence of multiple global models and
the absence of a central server. In this study, we present novel methodologies
for measuring participant contributions in DFL. We first propose DFL-Shapley,
an extension of the Shapley value tailored for DFL, adapting this widely used
CFL metric to decentralized settings. Given the impracticality of computing the
ideal DFL-Shapley in real-world systems, we introduce DFL-MR, a computable
approximation that estimates overall contributions by accumulating round-wise
Shapley values. We evaluate DFL-Shapley and DFL-MR across various FL scenarios
and compare them with existing CFL metrics. The experimental results confirm
DFL-Shapley as a valid ground-truth metric and demonstrate DFL-MR's proximity
to DFL-Shapley across various settings, highlighting their effectiveness as
contribution metrics in DFL.

Conclusion: 提出的奖励调整方法和GRPOVI算法有效解决了RLHF训练效率问题，并为规则奖励的实证效果提供了解释。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique
for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values
and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach,
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many
LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a
challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial
policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we
propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by
provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences
and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a
nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To
overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$
algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by
explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an
important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into
the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance
increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we
provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with
rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment
results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the
RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Abstract: Recent Diffusion models (DMs) advancements have explored incorporating the
second-order diffusion Fisher information (DF), defined as the negative Hessian
of log density, into various downstream tasks and theoretical analysis.
However, current practices typically approximate the diffusion Fisher by
applying auto-differentiation to the learned score network. This black-box
method, though straightforward, lacks any accuracy guarantee and is
time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the diffusion Fisher actually
resides within a space spanned by the outer products of score and initial data.
Based on the outer-product structure, we develop two efficient approximation
algorithms to access the trace and matrix-vector multiplication of DF,
respectively. These algorithms bypass the auto-differentiation operations with
time-efficient vector-product calculations. Furthermore, we establish the
approximation error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Experiments in
likelihood evaluation and adjoint optimization demonstrate the superior
accuracy and reduced computational cost of our proposed algorithms.
Additionally, based on the novel outer-product formulation of DF, we design the
first numerical verification experiment for the optimal transport property of
the general PF-ODE deduced map.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their
capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require
extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain
sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising
concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to
request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the
development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific
knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these
advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this
work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning
evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and
five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we
evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.
To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel
technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the
limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

subsequently applied within the study region, allowing for an effective

Abstract: Determining conditional independence (CI) relationships between random
variables is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and
statistics, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing generative
model-based CI testing methods, such as those utilizing generative adversarial
networks (GANs), often struggle with undesirable modeling of conditional
distributions and training instability, resulting in subpar performance. To
address these issues, we propose a novel CI testing method via score-based
generative modeling, which achieves precise Type I error control and strong
testing power. Concretely, we first employ a sliced conditional score matching
scheme to accurately estimate conditional score and use Langevin dynamics
conditional sampling to generate null hypothesis samples, ensuring precise Type
I error control. Then, we incorporate a goodness-of-fit stage into the method
to verify generated samples and enhance interpretability in practice. We
theoretically establish the error bound of conditional distributions modeled by
score-based generative models and prove the validity of our CI tests. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a
promising way to revitalize generative model-based CI testing.

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable
for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and
offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have
historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods
such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using
hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve
performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these
techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized
sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter
estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of
HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to
interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our
experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being
orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on
categorical data.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving

development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple
accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are
larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow
Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more
domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be
extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our
methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower
serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary
datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests
within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric.
We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve

Conclusion: GraphPAE通过双路径设计有效结合节点特征和位置信息，成功捕获图的多样化频率信息，显著提升了表达能力。

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations
without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders
(GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability.
Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements,
such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation
reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture
low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural
information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders
(GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node
features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding
to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict
the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node
representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby
enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct
extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including
heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer
learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art
performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Result: 实验显示异常频率减少70%，收入提升74%，调度速度翻倍。

Conclusion: Sentinel有效解决CCPs调度问题，显著提升性能和收益。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge
service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting
the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in
optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve
practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the
substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in
time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes
Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel
models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in
the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a
strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers
an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the
scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that
Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by
74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.

Abstract: Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, if these rewards
are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect
the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively
define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward
unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward
fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing
for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model
preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as
resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and
fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization
and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods
in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness
reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these
scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a
more fair manner.

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects
crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received
increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including
limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions.
Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's
learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However,
interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may
face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to
explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with
imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three
representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate
control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how
input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between
them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural
network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under
limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the
three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse
environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating
imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL
agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping
and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,
achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast,
reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive
to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the
importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect
inputs.

Abstract: Dynamic Spectral Backpropagation (DSBP) enhances neural network training
under resource constraints by projecting gradients onto principal eigenvectors,
reducing complexity and promoting flat minima. Five extensions are proposed,
dynamic spectral inference, spectral architecture optimization, spectral meta
learning, spectral transfer regularization, and Lie algebra inspired dynamics,
to address challenges in robustness, fewshot learning, and hardware efficiency.
Supported by a third order stochastic differential equation (SDE) and a PAC
Bayes limit, DSBP outperforms Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), Low Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), and Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) on CIFAR 10, Fashion
MNIST, MedMNIST, and Tiny ImageNet, as demonstrated through extensive
experiments and visualizations. Future work focuses on scalability, bias
mitigation, and ethical considerations.

Abstract: Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in
speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are
commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally
expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a
production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and
explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance
models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using
pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large
longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting
time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly
associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning
approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional
mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest
performance.

Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing
next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond
era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based
techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments.
With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand
for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interoperability of modeling.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly
being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not
assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this
paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss
models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the
model formulation, evaluation, and refinement, facilitating model discovery. We
evaluate two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full
interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing
two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic
and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
achieve R^2 values close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep
Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover,
on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform
traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors,
offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the
efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

Conclusion: 后处理OOD检测是一种高效且保护隐私的类增量学习解决方案，适用于开放世界场景。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world
scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without
forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a
closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by
(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,
and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)
detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a
memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and
increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of
post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the
need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied
appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for
buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves
comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of
class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings,
offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL
systems for open-world settings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双向预测编码（bPC）模型，结合了生成式和判别式推理，在多项任务中表现优于单向模型，更接近生物视觉推理。

Motivation: 现有预测编码模型多为单向（生成或判别），而实验证据表明大脑采用双向推理。因此，需开发一种同时支持两种推理且生物合理的模型。

Method: 提出双向预测编码（bPC），通过设计同时适合生成和判别任务的能量景观，实现双向推理。

Result: bPC在生成和判别任务中表现优于单向模型，并在多模态学习和信息缺失推理任务中展现出更优性能。

Conclusion: bPC更接近生物视觉推理机制，为大脑计算模型提供了新视角。

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual
learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down
generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and
inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that
PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict
neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence
suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference,
while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring
bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC
model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while
maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC
matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or
discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously
suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two
biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with
missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference
more closely.

Abstract: In China's competitive fresh e-commerce market, optimizing operational
strategies, especially inventory management in front-end warehouses, is key to
enhance customer satisfaction and to gain a competitive edge. Front-end
warehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of
fresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of
deciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account
capacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize
(PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align
prediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer
satisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task
Optimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes
product selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer
satisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs
a 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal
inventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking
model PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a
post-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh
platform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO
method. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances
the full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and
narrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These
findings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at
front-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable
insights for future research in this domain.

TL;DR: DACER2通过引入Q梯度场目标和时间加权机制，显著提升了扩散策略在在线强化学习中的训练和推理效率，同时保持了或甚至提升了性能。

Motivation: 扩散模型在离线强化学习和模仿学习中表现出色，但在在线强化学习中，DACER需要大量扩散步骤，导致训练和推理效率低下。

Method: 提出Q梯度场目标作为辅助优化目标，并引入时间加权机制，以在不同扩散阶段分别优化去噪和动作细化。

Result: 实验结果表明，DACER2在大多数MuJoCo控制任务中仅需五步扩散即可达到最优性能，且比DACER更具多模态性。

Conclusion: DACER2通过高效的去噪和动作细化机制，解决了扩散策略在在线强化学习中的效率问题。

Abstract: Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise
in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy
Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse
diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy
gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost
of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training
efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance
degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant
bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To
improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing
performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary
optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step.
Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the
diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy.
To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the
model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine
actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and
several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five
diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to
DACER.

Abstract: Depression is a debilitating mood disorder negatively impacting millions
worldwide. While researchers have explored multiple verbal and non-verbal
behavioural cues for automated depression assessment, head motion has received
little attention thus far. Further, the common practice of validating machine
learning models via a single dataset can limit model generalisability. This
work examines the effectiveness and generalisability of models utilising
elementary head motion units, termed kinemes, for depression severity
estimation. Specifically, we consider three depression datasets from different
western cultures (German: AVEC2013, Australian: Blackdog and American: Pitt
datasets) with varied contextual and recording settings to investigate the
generalisability of the derived kineme patterns via two methods: (i) k-fold
cross-validation over individual/multiple datasets, and (ii) model reuse on
other datasets. Evaluating classification and regression performance with
classical machine learning methods, our results show that: (1) head motion
patterns are efficient biomarkers for estimating depression severity, achieving
highly competitive performance for both classification and regression tasks on
a variety of datasets, including achieving the second best Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) on the AVEC2013 dataset, and (2) kineme-based features are more
generalisable than (a) raw head motion descriptors for binary severity
classification, and (b) other visual behavioural cues for severity estimation
(regression).

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced
rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired
a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on
LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work
presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based
training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy
optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong
positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel
metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models.
This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL
training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it
into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples.
Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5
percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
while generating more diverse and robust solutions.

Abstract: Ranking systems influence decision-making in high-stakes domains like health,
education, and employment, where they can have substantial economic and social
impacts. This makes the integration of safety mechanisms essential. One such
mechanism is $\textit{abstention}$, which enables algorithmic decision-making
system to defer uncertain or low-confidence decisions to human experts. While
abstention have been predominantly explored in the context of classification
tasks, its application to other machine learning paradigms remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for abstention in
pairwise learning-to-rank tasks. Our approach is based on thresholding the
ranker's conditional risk: the system abstains from making a decision when the
estimated risk exceeds a predefined threshold. Our contributions are threefold:
a theoretical characterization of the optimal abstention strategy, a
model-agnostic, plug-in algorithm for constructing abstaining ranking models,
and a comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 实验表明SPR优于其他正则化方法，显著提升KGC模型的性能。

Conclusion: SPR正则化方法有效突破KGC模型的性能边界，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in
recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge
graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most
previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a
deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential.
This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through
extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully
designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance
but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their
original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization
method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC
regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with
significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many
components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various
comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the
SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can
enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Result: 关键发现是通用逼近器（如神经网络）在战略环境中不再通用，实验显示性能差距存在于无限制模型类别中。

Conclusion: 结论是非线性分类器在战略环境中的表现受到限制，影响了学习效果和性能。

Abstract: In strategic classification, the standard supervised learning setting is
extended to support the notion of strategic user behavior in the form of costly
feature manipulations made in response to a classifier. While standard learning
supports a broad range of model classes, the study of strategic classification
has, so far, been dedicated mostly to linear classifiers. This work aims to
expand the horizon by exploring how strategic behavior manifests under
non-linear classifiers and what this implies for learning. We take a bottom-up
approach showing how non-linearity affects decision boundary points, classifier
expressivity, and model classes complexity. A key finding is that universal
approximators (e.g., neural nets) are no longer universal once the environment
is strategic. We demonstrate empirically how this can create performance gaps
even on an unrestricted model class.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合网络反演和分类器训练的新框架，用于同时处理分布外（OOD）检测和不确定性估计（UE）。通过引入“垃圾类”并迭代优化，模型能有效检测OOD样本并估计不确定性。

Motivation: 在现实场景中，机器学习系统常遇到意外输入，亟需OOD检测和UE能力以确保安全性。现有方法通常独立解决这两个问题，本文旨在统一解决。

Method: 扩展n类分类器至n+1类（新增垃圾类），通过网络反演迭代优化垃圾类样本，逐步清理类流形并提升OOD检测能力。

Result: 模型能有效检测OOD样本并将其分类到垃圾类，同时提供预测置信度用于不确定性估计，无需外部OOD数据集或后校准。

Conclusion: 该框架为OOD检测和UE提供了统一、可扩展且可解释的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are
critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in
real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier
training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty
estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the
classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially
populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each
training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images
corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and
incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the
classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues
iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution
data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out
meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing
OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme
enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying
them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with
each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution
and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require
access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while
providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and
uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: CFGRL成功结合了监督学习的简单性与强化学习的优化能力，显著提升性能。

Abstract: At the core of reinforcement learning is the idea of learning beyond the
performance in the data. However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously
tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably
scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by
deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion
models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of
supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On
offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting
leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate
without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple
supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further
prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.

Abstract: Ensuring convergence of policy gradient methods in federated reinforcement
learning (FRL) under environment heterogeneity remains a major challenge. In
this work, we first establish that heterogeneity, perhaps counter-intuitively,
can necessitate optimal policies to be non-deterministic or even time-varying,
even in tabular environments. Subsequently, we prove global convergence results
for federated policy gradient (FedPG) algorithms employing local updates, under
a {\L}ojasiewicz condition that holds only for each individual agent, in both
entropy-regularized and non-regularized scenarios. Crucially, our theoretical
analysis shows that FedPG attains linear speed-up with respect to the number of
agents, a property central to efficient federated learning. Leveraging insights
from our theoretical findings, we introduce b-RS-FedPG, a novel policy gradient
method that employs a carefully constructed softmax-inspired parameterization
coupled with an appropriate regularization scheme. We further demonstrate
explicit convergence rates for b-RS-FedPG toward near-optimal stationary
policies. Finally, we demonstrate that empirically both FedPG and b-RS-FedPG
consistently outperform federated Q-learning on heterogeneous settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种修复标注函数（LFs）的技术，通过最小化修改其输出，以提高弱监督标签的质量。

Motivation: 弱监督学习中标注函数的准确性直接影响标签质量，但手动修复成本高。希望通过少量标注数据自动修复LFs。

Method: 将LFs建模为条件规则，通过最小化修改其输出，确保标注数据有足够证据且LFs准确性足够高。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能基于极少量的标注数据显著提升LFs的质量。

Conclusion: 提出的修复技术能有效提高弱监督学习中的标签质量，减少人工干预。

Abstract: Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) significantly reduces human effort for
labeling data by combining the outputs of user-provided labeling functions
(LFs) on unlabeled datapoints. However, the quality of the generated labels
depends directly on the accuracy of the LFs. In this work, we study the problem
of fixing LFs based on a small set of labeled examples. Towards this goal, we
develop novel techniques for repairing a set of LFs by minimally changing their
results on the labeled examples such that the fixed LFs ensure that (i) there
is sufficient evidence for the correct label of each labeled datapoint and (ii)
the accuracy of each repaired LF is sufficiently high. We model LFs as
conditional rules which enables us to refine them, i.e., to selectively change
their output for some inputs. We demonstrate experimentally that our system
improves the quality of LFs based on surprisingly small sets of labeled
datapoints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种SGD在固定学习率下的热力学解释，显示SGD隐式最小化由训练损失和权重分布熵构成的自由能，学习率决定了温度效应。高学习率阻碍收敛，不同学习率稳定在不同的损失水平。实验验证了该框架在欠参数化和过参数化模型中的适用性。

Motivation: 研究SGD在神经网络训练中的行为，特别是固定学习率如何影响收敛性和稳定性。试图从热力学角度解释SGD的行为机制。

Method: 提出自由能框架$F=U-TS$，分析SGD如何平衡训练损失$U$和权重分布熵$S$，学习率决定温度$T$。在欠参数化和过参数化模型上进行了实验验证。

Result: 欠参数化模型遵循自由能最小化，温度随学习率单调增加。过参数化模型在低学习率时温度降至零，SGD直接最小化损失并收敛到最优解。

Conclusion: 自由能框架为SGD行为提供了新视角，解释了学习率对训练动态的影响。欠参数化和过参数化模型的行为差异源于随机梯度在最优值附近的信噪比差异。

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic interpretation of the stationary behavior of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under fixed learning rates (LRs) in neural
network training. We show that SGD implicitly minimizes a free energy function
$F=U-TS$, balancing training loss $U$ and the entropy of the weights
distribution $S$, with temperature $T$ determined by the LR. This perspective
offers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss
minima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We
empirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP)
and overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy
minimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP
models, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to
minimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum. We attribute this
mismatch to differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradients
near optima, supported by both a toy example and neural network experiments.

Conclusion: 该研究为处理多重认知不确定性提供了一个新的理论框架，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic
uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify
the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings
introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the
basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple
tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the
source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an
accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce
a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic,
decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i)
consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of
epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each
of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries
of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the
settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within
$\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization
bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and
validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.

TL;DR: 本文指出当前基于二阶分布的方法未能充分捕捉认知不确定性的关键部分，尤其是模型偏差的影响，通过理论分析和合成实验揭示了高模型偏差可能导致认知不确定性的低估。

Motivation: 近年来，许多监督学习方法试图通过二阶分布来区分偶发不确定性和认知不确定性，但这些方法往往忽略了模型偏差这一关键因素，导致认知不确定性的不完整表示。

Method: 作者采用了一种更细致的机器学习模型认知不确定性来源分类法，并通过基于模拟的评估协议来分析期望预测误差的偏差-方差分解，以展示当前方法的局限性。

Result: 研究发现，高模型偏差会导致认知不确定性的低估，现有二阶不确定性量化方法会将偏差引起的误差模糊为偶发性不确定性，从而低估认知不确定性。

Conclusion: 只有在所有相关认知不确定性来源得到适当表示的情况下，有意义的偶发性不确定性估计才是可行的。

Abstract: In recent years various supervised learning methods that disentangle
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on second-order distributions have
been proposed. We argue that these methods fail to capture critical components
of epistemic uncertainty, particularly due to the often-neglected component of
model bias. To show this, we make use of a more fine-grained taxonomy of
epistemic uncertainty sources in machine learning models, and analyse how the
classical bias-variance decomposition of the expected prediction error can be
decomposed into different parts reflecting these uncertainties. By using a
simulation-based evaluation protocol which encompasses epistemic uncertainty
due to both procedural- and data-driven uncertainty components, we illustrate
that current methods rarely capture the full spectrum of epistemic uncertainty.
Through theoretical insights and synthetic experiments, we show that high model
bias can lead to misleadingly low estimates of epistemic uncertainty, and
common second-order uncertainty quantification methods systematically blur
bias-induced errors into aleatoric estimates, thereby underrepresenting
epistemic uncertainty. Our findings underscore that meaningful aleatoric
estimates are feasible only if all relevant sources of epistemic uncertainty
are properly represented.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AnchorAttention的动态稀疏注意力机制，通过细粒度条纹稀疏识别和差异感知计算，提升长文本处理中的计算效率和准确性。

Motivation: 现有方法在长文本处理中因局部信息依赖和块稀疏导致效率低下，需要一种能全局感知并高效识别关键区域的机制。

Method: 使用模式化锚点计算、差异感知条纹稀疏识别和细粒度稀疏计算三个组件，动态识别关键注意力区域。

Result: 在128k文本长度下，速度提升1.44倍，同时保持更高的召回率。

Conclusion: AnchorAttention通过细粒度稀疏策略，在保持高召回的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths face significant
computational challenges during the pre-filling phase, primarily due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing methods typically employ
dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However,
their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture
global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent
internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware,
dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical
attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global
contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention
comprises three key components: (1) \textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation},
leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set
of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \textbf{Difference-aware Stripe
Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the
anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a
stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation},
replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with
simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while
preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained
sparsity strategy, \textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at
the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time. Compared to
previous state-of-the-art methods, at a text length of 128k, it achieves a
speedup of 1.44$\times$ while maintaining higher recall rates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StragglAR的AllReduce算法，用于解决分布式机器学习中因持续性慢节点导致的延迟问题，通过在慢节点延迟期间执行部分计算，最终实现了性能提升。

Motivation: 分布式机器学习任务依赖AllReduce同步梯度或激活值，但持续性慢节点会延迟同步，影响整体效率。现有算法对这种情况处理不佳，因此需要一种新方法来加速训练和推理。

Method: 提出StragglAR算法：在慢节点延迟期间，其他GPU执行ReduceScatter操作；慢节点到达后，通过新设计的集体算法完成AllReduce。

Result: 理论速度提升2倍（大型GPU集群）；在8-GPU服务器上实现了22%的速度提升（相比现有最优算法）。

Conclusion: StragglAR有效解决了持续性慢节点问题，显著提升了分布式训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning workloads use data and tensor parallelism for
training and inference, both of which rely on the AllReduce collective to
synchronize gradients or activations. However, bulk-synchronous AllReduce
algorithms can be delayed by a persistent straggler that is slower to reach the
synchronization barrier required to begin the collective. To address this
challenge, we propose StragglAR: an AllReduce algorithm that accelerates
distributed training and inference in the presence of persistent stragglers.
StragglAR implements a ReduceScatter among the remaining GPUs during the
straggler-induced delay, and then executes a novel collective algorithm to
complete the AllReduce once the straggler reaches the synchronization barrier.
StragglAR achieves a 2x theoretical speedup over popular bandwidth-efficient
AllReduce algorithms (e.g., Ring) for large GPU clusters with persistent
stragglers. On an 8-GPU server, our implementation of StragglAR yields a 22%
speedup over state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出利用归一化流（NFs）替代传统强化学习中的复杂概率模型（如扩散模型或自回归模型），简化算法并提升性能。

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法依赖复杂概率模型（如扩散模型或自回归模型），但这些模型计算成本高或需要学习离散表示。NFs无需微分方程或自回归结构，但被认为表达能力不足。作者反驳了这一观点。

Method: 基于NFs的最新研究，提出单一NF架构，无缝集成到RL算法中，作为策略、Q函数和占用度量。

Result: 方法简化了算法，在模仿学习、离线学习、目标条件RL和无监督RL中性能更高。

Conclusion: NFs在RL中具有潜力，能够提供高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using
powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and
diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay
the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion
models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance
on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are
scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing
flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they
enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or
autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received
limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows
lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on
recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates
seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy
measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher
performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and
unsupervised RL.

Motivation: 探讨机器学习模型在MCI和AD诊断中可能存在的年龄、种族和性别偏见，并评估公平性定义和指标的可靠性。

Method: 分析了多队列数据集中年龄、种族和性别的偏见及其代理特征的影响，评估多种公平性定义和指标，比较了预处理、处理中和后处理的偏见缓解策略，引入了一种新的综合指标来衡量公平性与性能的权衡。

Result: 研究发现了年龄和种族相关的偏见，但没有显著的性别偏见。不同缓解策略在不同敏感属性和子问题上表现各异，Reject Option Classification在种族和性别上显著改善了公平性。

Conclusion: 研究为AD神经病理学和风险因素如何影响模型公平性提供了见解，并展示了不同偏见缓解策略的有效性。

Abstract: The present study performs a comprehensive fairness analysis of machine
learning (ML) models for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI-derived neuroimaging features. Biases
associated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the
influence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are
investigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in
the identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most
appropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies
is performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the
trade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the
equalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic
applications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to
age and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed
mitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across
the different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and
gender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%,
respectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI
versus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial
debiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic
mean score of 0.69. Insights are provided into how variations in AD
neuropathology and risk factors, associated with demographic characteristics,
influence model fairness.

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine
learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into
low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used
in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we
propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our
approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps
subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input
subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled
distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the
Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the
similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive
learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against
state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of
SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the
generated contrastive pairs.

Motivation: 现有的TN-SS算法计算成本高且忽略了数据中的领域信息，缺乏结构透明度。

Result: tnLLM在较少函数评估下达到与SOTA相当的性能，并能加速传统方法的收敛。

Conclusion: tnLLM通过LLM和领域信息的结合，高效解决了TN-SS问题，同时提供了可解释性。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional
data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor
network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they
require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world
applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information
inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN
structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,
which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict
suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware
prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures
based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our
approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,
but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.
Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective
function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA
algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information
can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based
SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical
performance guarantees.

Abstract: Federated LoRA has emerged as a promising technique for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the
number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately
overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data
heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency,
particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the
convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and
communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for
federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without
requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an
adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client
resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we
formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the
LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock
convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to
approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to
state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了SPO（Segment Policy Optimization），一种新型强化学习框架，通过段级优势估计平衡了细粒度和粗粒度方法的优缺点，在推理任务上显著优于PPO和GRPO。

Motivation: 解决现有强化学习方法在语言模型推理中优势估计粒度不精确的问题，细粒度方法（如PPO）因难以训练精确的评论模型导致估计不准确，而粗粒度方法（如GRPO）仅依赖最终奖励信号导致信用分配不精确。

Method: 提出了SPO框架，包含三个创新组件：灵活的段划分、准确的段优势估计和基于段优势的策略优化（包括概率掩码策略）。具体实例化为SPO-chain（短链推理）和SPO-tree（长链推理），分别采用基于切割点的划分与链式优势估计，以及基于树的优势估计以减少蒙特卡罗估计开销。

Result: 在GSM8K任务上比PPO和GRPO提升6-12个百分点准确率；在MATH500任务（2K和4K上下文）上比GRPO提升7-11个百分点。

Conclusion: SPO通过中间粒度优势估计实现了更精确的信用分配和更低的计算开销，为语言模型推理任务提供了高效强化学习方案。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively
using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing
approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:
Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage
signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training
an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,
GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,
leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we
propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages
segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a
better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level
methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,
enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a
critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible
segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy
optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask
strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain
for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and
chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point
improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,
featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RP-GSSM的无监督学习方法，用于学习时间序列数据中的潜在动态结构，结合了对比方法的直观性和概率生成模型的灵活性。

Motivation: 现有方法在建模时间序列数据时存在局限性，对比方法缺乏概率模型的严格性，而生成方法需要复杂的映射网络。RP-GSSM旨在解决这些不足，无需额外正则化或辅助损失。

Method: RP-GSSM是一种概率模型，通过最大似然学习高斯潜在变量，利用非线性神经网络链接观测和潜在变量，实现精确推断和表达能力。

Result: RP-GSSM在包括视频中的非线性随机动力学学习等任务中优于替代方法，无论是否存在背景干扰。

Conclusion: RP-GSSM是一种有效的无监督学习方法，适合作为多种下游应用的基础模型。

Abstract: We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with
latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space
model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian
Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at
different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the
flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive
approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum
likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an
explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus
model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and
expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent
prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural
network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the
RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary
losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms
alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics
from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the
RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.

TL;DR: BioReason integrates DNA foundation models with LLMs to enhance multi-step biological reasoning, achieving significant performance improvements and interpretability.

Motivation: Current DNA foundation models lack multi-step reasoning and transparent explanations, hindering scientific discovery.

Method: BioReason combines a DNA foundation model with an LLM, using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning for multi-step reasoning.

Result: BioReason improves accuracy from 88% to 97% on disease pathway prediction and shows a 15% performance gain over baselines.

Conclusion: BioReason offers interpretable, step-by-step reasoning, enabling deeper insights and faster hypothesis generation from genomic data.

Abstract: Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data
is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation
models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step
reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations.
We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time,
deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM).
This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with
genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal
biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is
developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning,
guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On
biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction
- where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction,
BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong
single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities
and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological
traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables
deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from
genomic data. Data, code, and checkpoints are publicly available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种模型无关框架PIR，通过后预测识别和修订来提升时间序列预测性能，有效减少实例级误差并提高预测可靠性。

Motivation: 虽然近期方法通过引入高级归纳偏置和训练策略取得了显著准确性，但实例级变体（如分布偏移、缺失数据和长尾模式）仍是重要挑战，导致特定实例的预测效果不佳。

Method: PIR框架通过后预测识别和修订来优化预测：首先通过估计准确性识别偏差预测实例，然后利用上下文信息（包括协变量和历史时间序列）从局部和全局视角进行后处理修订。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，PIR显著减少了实例级误差并提高了主流预测模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: PIR框架为解决实例级预测偏差提供了一种有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications
and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods
have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases
and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a
significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts,
missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for
specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address
this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance
forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision.
Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating
their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using
contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from
both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models
demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and
significantly improves forecasting reliability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language
models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities.
However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training
instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency
due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal
reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm
designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact
on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and
enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that
theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and
training stability without additional models or regularization terms.
Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,
encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight
OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in
large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is

Abstract: This paper explores second-order optimization methods in Federated Learning
(FL), addressing the critical challenges of slow convergence and the excessive
communication rounds required to achieve optimal performance from the global
model. While existing surveys in FL primarily focus on challenges related to
statistical and device label heterogeneity, as well as privacy and security
concerns in first-order FL methods, less attention has been given to the issue
of slow model training. This slow training often leads to the need for
excessive communication rounds or increased communication costs, particularly
when data across clients are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we examine
various FL methods that leverage second-order optimization to accelerate the
training process. We provide a comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art
second-order FL methods and compare their performance based on convergence
speed, computational cost, memory usage, transmission overhead, and
generalization of the global model. Our findings show the potential of
incorporating Hessian curvature through second-order optimization into FL and
highlight key challenges, such as the efficient utilization of Hessian and its
inverse in FL. This work lays the groundwork for future research aimed at
developing scalable and efficient federated optimization methods for improving
the training of the global model in FL.

Abstract: Post-training of foundation language models has emerged as a promising
research domain in federated learning (FL) with the goal to enable
privacy-preserving model improvements and adaptations to user's downstream
tasks. Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches
that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access
to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models
has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL
raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL
contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and
autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box
models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various
aspects of openness and their implications for FL.

Result: 所有测试的LLM均能解决高度混淆的任务，但表现依赖训练数据的记忆，未见真正推理能力。

Conclusion: 需谨慎设计基准测试，提出通过性能衰减检测数据集污染，提示自动化系统的安全风险。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
recognise and solve tasks which have been obfuscated beyond recognition.
Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we
compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as
noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks
obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers,
and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the
concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not
observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating
strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate
reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct
performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss
the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing
for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose
measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for
detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and
interpretability issues for automated software systems.

Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying
sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for
domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on
graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional
data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this
body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across
dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in
a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent
large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We
instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the
necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design
principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support
our findings.

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities --
such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning --
within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified
models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and
non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to
limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion
transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and
image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch,
Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone
with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal
generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger
autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the
potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual
priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power grids to smart grids, significant
increase in the use of renewable energy sources, and soaring electricity prices
has triggered a digital transformation of the energy infrastructure that
enables new, data driven, applications often supported by machine learning
models. However, the majority of the developed machine learning models rely on
univariate data. To date, a structured study considering the role meta-data and
additional measurements resulting in multivariate data is missing. In this
paper we propose a taxonomy that identifies and structures various types of
data related to energy applications. The taxonomy can be used to guide
application specific data model development for training machine learning
models. Focusing on a household electricity forecasting application, we
validate the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy in guiding the selection of
the features for various types of models. As such, we study of the effect of
domain, contextual and behavioral features on the forecasting accuracy of four
interpretable machine learning techniques and three openly available datasets.
Finally, using a feature importance techniques, we explain individual feature
contributions to the forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: 提出的方法不仅扩展了Skew Spectrum的适用性，还通过理论证明和实验验证了其在表达能力和计算效率上的优势。

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings,
generalizing the Skew Spectrum of graphs of Kondor & Borgwardt (2008). Grounded
in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of
graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer
graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and
hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization
further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between
computational complexity and expressivity. By applying
generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew
Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the
invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness
through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.

in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time
objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general
framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the
generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed
Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using
breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range
of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and
image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both
performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a
principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion

Motivation: 尽管DPO在经验上成功对齐语言模型与人类偏好，但其对数比率奖励参数的理论基础尚不完善，需要进一步研究。

Method: 利用微分信息分布（DID），分析偏好标签中隐含的微分信息，推导出DPO对数比率奖励的唯一最优性，并通过熵分析解释策略行为的差异。

Result: 实验验证了高熵微分信息对通用指令遵循的重要性，而低熵微分信息则对知识密集型问答更有效。

Conclusion: 研究通过微分信息的视角统一了DPO目标、偏好数据结构和策略行为，为理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) achieve outstanding performance in many domains;
however, their decision processes are often opaque and their inference can be
computationally expensive in resource-constrained environments. We recently
proposed Differentiable Logic Networks (DLNs) to address these issues for
tabular classification based on relaxing discrete logic into a differentiable
form, thereby enabling gradient-based learning of networks built from binary
logic operations. DLNs offer interpretable reasoning and substantially lower
inference cost.
  We extend the DLN framework to supervised tabular regression. Specifically,
we redesign the final output layer to support continuous targets and unify the
original two-phase training procedure into a single differentiable stage. We
evaluate the resulting model on 15 public regression benchmarks, comparing it
with modern neural networks and classical regression baselines. Regression DLNs
match or exceed baseline accuracy while preserving interpretability and fast
inference. Our results show that DLNs are a viable, cost-effective alternative
for regression tasks, especially where model transparency and computational
efficiency are important.

Conclusion: 结合目标文本提示的端到端架构能有效改进阅读错误标注。

Abstract: Identifying mistakes (i.e., miscues) made while reading aloud is commonly
approached post-hoc by comparing automatic speech recognition (ASR)
transcriptions to the target reading text. However, post-hoc methods perform
poorly when ASR inaccurately transcribes verbatim speech. To improve on current
methods for reading error annotation, we propose a novel end-to-end
architecture that incorporates the target reading text via prompting and is
trained for both improved verbatim transcription and direct miscue detection.
Our contributions include: first, demonstrating that incorporating reading text
through prompting benefits verbatim transcription performance over fine-tuning,
and second, showing that it is feasible to augment speech recognition tasks for
end-to-end miscue detection. We conducted two case studies -- children's
read-aloud and adult atypical speech -- and found that our proposed strategies
improve verbatim transcription and miscue detection compared to current
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了模型上下文协议（MCP）对虚假良性攻击（FBA）的易受攻击性，提出了通过直接偏好优化（DPO）和检索增强生成偏好对齐（RAG-Pref）来增强大语言模型（LLM）对这种攻击的防御能力。

Motivation: MCP作为开源标准被广泛使用，但现有研究表明其易受FBAs攻击，攻击者只需在线发布恶意内容即可欺骗MCP代理对受害者系统发起攻击，因此需要改进对齐防护措施。

Method: 作者引入了新的MCP数据集，探索了DPO对于LLMs拒绝训练的有效性，并提出了RAG-Pref这一基于检索增强生成的新偏好对齐策略。

Result: 研究表明，DPO能提升模型防护能力，但效果因模型原有的对齐方案而异；RAG-Pref结合DPO能显著提升LLMs拒绝FBAs的能力。

Conclusion: RAG-Pref结合DPO显著提升了LLMs对MCP攻击的防护能力，为改进MCP的安全性提供了新方法。

Abstract: The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard
enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work
has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks
(FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring
that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we
show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than
previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to
deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims'
systems.
  To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP
dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of
direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language
models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we
show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the
model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to
refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel
preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly
improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with
DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.

Conclusion: 研究表明，该方法在复杂图搜索空间下表现优异，为NAS提供了高效的数据优化工具。

Abstract: Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown potential as a powerful and
data-efficient tool for neural architecture search (NAS). Most existing graph
BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks
and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However,
the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph
structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph
search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit
optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as
reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph
kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed
encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide
restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical
results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the
optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.

Result: 实验证实CoT2提升模型性能，单层Transformer可解决子集和问题，且策略优化效果优于初始监督。

Conclusion: CoT2为链式思考提供更优的表达和效率，未来可扩展至更多复杂任务。

Abstract: Current language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively
sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has
achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with
continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive
alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning
tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and
exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model
to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference
efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably
solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding
dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy
where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a
set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that
unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy
samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the
level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second
strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex.
Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the
performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.

Conclusion: HDRQ方法在量化环境中显著提升了模型合并的效果，为多目标域适应提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific
weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation.
However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new
challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to
target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and
introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In
this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the
lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel
post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing
quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target
domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs
minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss
surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first
study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 揭示了隐式推理的表示结构机制，为提升模型可解释性提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop
reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly
verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by
training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our
analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization,
followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution
generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but
accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level
exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we
introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies
semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based
representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with
the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn
provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across
training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These
findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop
reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold
internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.

Abstract: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh.
Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in
critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome
manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert
Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation.
Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e.,
a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target
mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an
out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical
graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically
projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate
AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical
components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER
generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent
baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and
Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.

Conclusion: 在偏好反馈下，通过理论改进实现了与传统BO相当的样本效率，为实际应用提供更强保障。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) with preference-based feedback has recently
garnered significant attention due to its emerging applications. We refer to
this problem as Bayesian Optimization from Human Feedback (BOHF), which differs
from conventional BO by learning the best actions from a reduced feedback
model, where only the preference between two actions is revealed to the learner
at each time step. The objective is to identify the best action using a limited
number of preference queries, typically obtained through costly human feedback.
Existing work, which adopts the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) feedback model,
provides regret bounds for the performance of several algorithms. In this work,
within the same framework we develop tighter performance guarantees.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma(T)T})$, where $\Gamma(T)$ represents the
maximum information gain$\unicode{x2014}$a kernel-specific complexity
term$\unicode{x2014}$and $T$ is the number of queries. Our results
significantly improve upon existing bounds. Notably, for common kernels, we
show that the order-optimal sample complexities of conventional
BO$\unicode{x2014}$achieved with richer feedback models$\unicode{x2014}$are
recovered. In other words, the same number of preferential samples as
scalar-valued samples is sufficient to find a nearly optimal solution.

Abstract: Neural network minima are often connected by curves along which train and
test loss remain nearly constant, a phenomenon known as mode connectivity.
While this property has enabled applications such as model merging and
fine-tuning, its theoretical explanation remains unclear. We propose a new
approach to exploring the connectedness of minima using parameter space
symmetry. By linking the topology of symmetry groups to that of the minima, we
derive the number of connected components of the minima of linear networks and
show that skip connections reduce this number. We then examine when mode
connectivity and linear mode connectivity hold or fail, using parameter
symmetries which account for a significant part of the minimum. Finally, we
provide explicit expressions for connecting curves in the minima induced by
symmetry. Using the curvature of these curves, we derive conditions under which
linear mode connectivity approximately holds. Our findings highlight the role
of continuous symmetries in understanding the neural network loss landscape.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Prior theoretical work exploring the
expressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform
multi-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the
learnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data
distribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization,
remains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we
study the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires
computing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden
permutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\log k)$ layers. On
the negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that
any SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for
the $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in
$k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we
show that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and
sample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\log
k)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in
which data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \le k$
presented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is
presented simultaneously. Our work sheds light on the necessity and sufficiency
of having both easy and hard examples in the data distribution for transformers
to learn complex compositional tasks.

Conclusion: Oracle Border Basis算法是传统符号计算的高效、稳定、实用的增强方法。

Abstract: Solving systems of polynomial equations, particularly those with finitely
many solutions, is a crucial challenge across many scientific fields.
Traditional methods like Gr\"obner and Border bases are fundamental but suffer
from high computational costs, which have motivated recent Deep Learning
approaches to improve efficiency, albeit at the expense of output correctness.
In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep
Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining
output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle
that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which
we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this
oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup
factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the
correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling
method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a
tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic
computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which
reduces the number of tokens to encode an $n$-variate polynomial by a factor of
$O(n)$. Our learning approach is data efficient, stable, and a practical
enhancement to traditional computer algebra algorithms and symbolic
computation.

Motivation: 现有生成反事实解释的方法通常需要持续访问预测模型，计算密集，且缺乏适应新用户定义约束的灵活性。DiCoFlex旨在通过一次性前向传递生成多样化反事实，以解决这些局限性。

Method: DiCoFlex利用条件归一化流（conditional normalizing flows），仅基于标注数据训练，支持在推理时实时定制约束（如稀疏性和可操作性）。

Conclusion: DiCoFlex是一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于敏感决策领域的反事实生成。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations play a pivotal role in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) by offering intuitive, human-understandable alternatives
that elucidate machine learning model decisions. Despite their significance,
existing methods for generating counterfactuals often require constant access
to the predictive model, involve computationally intensive optimization for
each instance and lack the flexibility to adapt to new user-defined constraints
without retraining. In this paper, we propose DiCoFlex, a novel model-agnostic,
conditional generative framework that produces multiple diverse counterfactuals
in a single forward pass. Leveraging conditional normalizing flows trained
solely on labeled data, DiCoFlex addresses key limitations by enabling
real-time user-driven customization of constraints such as sparsity and
actionability at inference time. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity,
diversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and
scalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making
domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模块化神经网络架构(U)NFV，用于解决双曲线守恒律问题，它在精度和灵活性上优于传统有限体积方法，并在复杂场景中表现出色。

Motivation: 双曲线偏微分方程（尤其是守恒律）的求解具有挑战性，传统有限体积方法在复杂场景中精度不足且缺乏灵活性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过扩展时空模板学习更新规则并保留守恒结构，(U)NFV支持基于解数据的监督训练（NFV）和弱形式残差损失的无监督训练（UNFV）。

Result: (U)NFV在一阶守恒律中的误差比Godunov方法低10倍，性能优于ENO/WENO，并与不连续Galerkin求解器相当但更简单；在交通建模中也显示出更高的精度和扩展性。

Conclusion: (U)NFV为双曲线守恒律提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案，显著优于传统有限体积方法。

Abstract: We introduce (U)NFV, a modular neural network architecture that generalizes
classical finite volume (FV) methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws.
Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve,
particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain
shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical
properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total
variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex
settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update
rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation
structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and
unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to
first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than
Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin
solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs
and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics
with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV
approaches.

Conclusion: 保护VLM主干知识在VLA训练中的完整性对提升模型性能至关重要，未来需进一步优化设计。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training
control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end
learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language
model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often
at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds
of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and
operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are
required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models
have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action
experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new
untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules
improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether
they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained
VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we
study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion
or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts
significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an
extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and
knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone
during VLA training that mitigates this issue. Videos are available at

TL;DR: TiRex introduces an enhanced LSTM (xLSTM) with strong in-context learning abilities for zero-shot time series forecasting, outperforming existing models.

Motivation: Existing transformer-based models underperform in time series forecasting, while LSTMs lack in-context learning. TiRex aims to combine the strengths of both.

Method: Leveraging xLSTM with a CPM masking strategy to enhance state-tracking and in-context learning.

Result: TiRex achieves SOTA performance in zero-shot forecasting on HuggingFace benchmarks, surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: TiRex bridges the gap between in-context learning and time series forecasting, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks
using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time
series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past
values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful
forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when
training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely
on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often
fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models
like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited
for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack
strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap
by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning
skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as
RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon
forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a
training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in
zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and
Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS
(Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce)
across both short- and long-term forecasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为COBRA的算法，用于解决多智能体情境下的上下文赌博问题，旨在抑制智能体的策略性行为，同时保持激励兼容性和次线性遗憾保证。

Motivation: 现有研究假设智能体会如实报告其选择，但这在许多实际应用（如在线平台卖家可能虚报产品质量）中不现实，因此需要一种无需货币激励即可抑制策略性行为的解决方案。

Method: 提出了COBRA算法，通过设计机制使智能体无法通过策略性行为获益，从而实现激励兼容性，并保证次线性遗憾。

Result: 实验验证了COBRA算法在多智能体情境中的有效性，能够抑制策略性行为并保持较好的性能。

Conclusion: COBRA算法为解决多智能体上下文赌博问题中的策略性行为提供了一种有效且无需货币激励的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了DiffER，一种基于分类扩散的无模板化学逆合成预测方法，通过扩散模型集合实现了领先的预测准确率。

Motivation: 传统基于自然语言处理模型的逆合成方法受自回归特性限制，DiffER旨在通过扩散模型克服这一限制。

Method: 采用分类扩散模型，结合SMILES序列长度预测组件，构建模型集合以同步预测整个序列。

Result: 在top-1准确率上达到领先水平，在top-3、5、10上表现具竞争力，并验证了长度预测对性能的关键作用。

Conclusion: DiffER为无模板模型提供了新基准，能够学习实验合成技术，并通过后验采样提升结果可信度。

Abstract: Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success
through the application of models traditionally built for natural language
processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have
demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of
chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their
autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method
for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which
allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We
construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art
performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5,
and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a
strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a
variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a
variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By
constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length
prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample
from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong
metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate
that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further
boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SC-LoRA是一种新的LoRA初始化框架，通过约束LoRA适配器的输出在低秩子空间中，平衡高效微调与知识保留问题。

Motivation: vanilla LoRA存在收敛速度慢和知识遗忘问题，需要一种方法同时提高微调效率并保留预训练知识。

Method: 提出SC-LoRA，通过约束LoRA适配器的输出在低秩子空间中，平衡微调数据的主要特征与保存知识的特征。

Result: 实验表明，SC-LoRA在保持微调性能的同时显著减少知识遗忘，优于当前LoRA初始化方法。

Conclusion: SC-LoRA成功解决了LoRA在高效微调和知识保留之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and
knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of
designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to
preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can
address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce
Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework
engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and
knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable
LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of
fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved
knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the
trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data
while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide
theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including
safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream
tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning
performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing
contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MuLoCo（基于Muon内部优化器的DiLoCo）在减少通信频率的同时，通过压缩技术（如2位量化）显著降低通信开销，且性能几乎无损。

Motivation: 现有DiLoCo框架在减少通信频率时仍需全量参数通信，探索如何进一步减少通信开销，尤其是误差反馈累积器和内部优化器对压缩性的影响。

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化等标准压缩方法，测试两种局部优化器（AdamW和Muon）在DiLoCo中的表现。

Result: Muon优化器配合误差反馈累积器可将通信量压缩至2位，性能接近无损，同时通信量减少8倍，内存复杂度不变。

Conclusion: MuLoCo在通信效率和性能上均优于DiLoCo，展示了压缩技术与特定优化器组合的潜力。

Abstract: DiLoCo is a powerful framework for training large language models (LLMs)
under networking constraints with advantages for increasing parallelism and
accelerator utilization in data center settings. Despite significantly reducing
communication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve
all-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works
have explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error
feedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility
remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
standard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization
for reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local
optimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only
transformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner
optimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to
aggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no
performance degradation. Crucially, MuLoCo (Muon inner optimizer DiLoCo)
significantly outperforms DiLoCo while communicating 8X less and having
identical memory complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmotionRankCLAP通过引入监督对比学习方法，利用情感语音的维度特征和自然语言提示，改进了跨模态对齐并捕捉了情感的序数关系。

Motivation: 现有基于情感的比较语言-音频预训练方法通常简单地对齐音频样本与文本提示，忽略了情感的序数性质，导致模态间理解不足和模态差距大。

Method: 提出EmotionRankCLAP，使用情感的价-唤醒空间中的排名对比目标，学习和建模情感的序数关系。

Result: EmotionRankCLAP在跨模态检索任务中优于现有方法，显著提升了情感的序数建模能力。

Conclusion: EmotionRankCLAP通过Rank-N-Contrast目标有效捕捉了情感的序数关系，改善了跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Current emotion-based contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) methods
typically learn by na\"ively aligning audio samples with corresponding text
prompts. Consequently, this approach fails to capture the ordinal nature of
emotions, hindering inter-emotion understanding and often resulting in a wide
modality gap between the audio and text embeddings due to insufficient
alignment. To handle these drawbacks, we introduce EmotionRankCLAP, a
supervised contrastive learning approach that uses dimensional attributes of
emotional speech and natural language prompts to jointly capture fine-grained
emotion variations and improve cross-modal alignment. Our approach utilizes a
Rank-N-Contrast objective to learn ordered relationships by contrasting samples
based on their rankings in the valence-arousal space. EmotionRankCLAP
outperforms existing emotion-CLAP methods in modeling emotion ordinality across
modalities, measured via a cross-modal retrieval task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 文章探讨了当前语言模型对齐方法的局限性，提出基于社会选择理论和个体Bradley-Terry模型的“失真”概念，并通过Nash Learning实现最小失真，优于RLHF和DPO方法。

Motivation: 研究动机是解决现有多样化用户偏好下，单一偏好模型对齐方法的不足，确保模型满足平均用户需求。

Method: 采用社会选择理论和个体Bradley-Terry模型，引入失真指标，提出Nash Learning方法。

Result: Nash Learning实现最小失真(1/2 + o(1))β，优于RLHF和DPO的较高失真或无界失真。

Conclusion: Nash Learning在多用户偏好对齐中表现最优，失真最小，适应性强。

Abstract: After pre-training, large language models are aligned with human preferences
based on pairwise comparisons. State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as
PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single
preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse
preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods
produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for
pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users'
comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an
alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal
achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy.
  The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment
methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal
distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature
$\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison
pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy. RLHF and DPO,
by contrast, suffer $\geq (1 - o(1)) \cdot \beta$ distortion already without a
KL constraint, and $e^{\Omega(\beta)}$ or even unbounded distortion in the full
setting, depending on how comparison pairs are sampled.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REOrder的两阶段框架，用于发现任务最优的patch顺序，通过信息论先验和强化学习优化，显著提升了模型性能。

Motivation: 现有序列模型在视觉任务中使用固定顺序（如行主序）处理图像patch，而实际性能受patch顺序影响，因此需要一种任务最优的顺序策略。

Method: REOrder框架：1）基于信息论评估patch序列的可压缩性；2）使用REINFORCE优化Plackett-Luce策略学习排列策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上比行主序最高提升3.01%的top-1准确率，在Functional Map of the World上提升13.35%。

Conclusion: 任务优化的patch顺序对模型性能有显著影响，REOrder框架能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Conclusion: 该框架和算法为模型免疫性提供了理论基础和实用工具，代码已开源，便于进一步研究与应用。

Abstract: Model immunization aims to pre-train models that are difficult to fine-tune
on harmful tasks while retaining their utility on other non-harmful tasks.
Though prior work has shown empirical evidence for immunizing text-to-image
models, the key understanding of when immunization is possible and a precise
definition of an immunized model remain unclear. In this work, we propose a
framework, based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model
immunization for linear models. Building on this framework, we design an
algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers
after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于代理架构的聊天机器人，帮助用户通过自然语言交互查询公共交通服务质量数据，并解决了生成式AI项目中性能评估数据收集的问题。

Motivation: 分析公共交通服务质量需要处理大量复杂数据，普通用户难以直接使用SQL查询和可视化工具。

Method: 采用代理架构扩展大型语言模型（LLM），使其能调用工具执行SQL查询、数据可视化和地图生成等任务，并通过工作流程收集性能评估数据。

Result: 开发了用户友好的聊天机器人，并通过实际数据测试验证了其查询一致性和生成查询的正确性。

Conclusion: 该聊天机器人有效简化了公共交通数据交互，同时为解决生成式AI性能评估提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of public transportation services requires the analysis
of large quantities of data on the scheduled and actual trips and documents
listing the quality constraints each service needs to meet. Interrogating such
datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite
complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly
tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based
on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large
Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can
execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating
maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one
of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to
measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with
a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the
retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such
questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with
actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the
evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its
answers and the correctness of the generated queries.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了人工势场（APFs）在解决多智能体路径规划（MAPF）和终身MAPF（LMAPF）问题中的应用，发现APFs对MAPF无效，但对LMAPF能提升系统吞吐量。

Motivation: 解决多智能体在动态目标环境中的路径规划问题，探索APFs在MAPF和LMAPF中的适用性。

Method: 将APFs整合到多种MAPF算法中，包括优先规划、MAPF-LNS2和优先级继承回溯（PIBT）。

Result: APFs对传统MAPF无显著帮助，但对于LMAPF可提升系统吞吐量高达7倍。

Conclusion: APFs在动态目标环境（LMAPF）中表现优异，但在静态MAPF中效果有限。

Abstract: We explore the use of Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) to solve Multi-Agent
Path Finding (MAPF) and Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problems. In MAPF, a team of
agents must move to their goal locations without collisions, whereas in LMAPF,
new goals are generated upon arrival. We propose methods for incorporating APFs
in a range of MAPF algorithms, including Prioritized Planning, MAPF-LNS2, and
Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT). Experimental results show that
using APF is not beneficial for MAPF but yields up to a 7-fold increase in
overall system throughput for LMAPF.

Motivation: 现有基于准确性的评估方法无法细粒度评估LLMs的推理能力，尤其是问题解决技能的内部化情况。为了更深入理解这些能力，研究将其分解为计划、执行和验证三个基本技能。

Method: 研究提出一种分解方法，将数学问题解决能力分为计划、执行和验证三个维度。通过实验验证GRPO对这些技能的影响，并构建一个合成的解决方案树导航任务作为数学问题解决的类比。

Result: GRPO主要提升执行能力（温度蒸馏现象），但对新问题因计划能力不足遇到'覆盖墙'。合成任务验证了RL主要增强执行鲁棒性，并在特定条件下可能通过改进探索和泛化克服限制。

Conclusion: 强化学习在提升LLM推理能力方面有效但存在局限性，尤其是在计划能力上。研究为克服这些限制提供了方向。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy
metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail
to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better
understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into
fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),
Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the
correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the
execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already
knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More
importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new
problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To
explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic
solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.
This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL
primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we
identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall
through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our
findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,
expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Motivation: 全球心理健康問題嚴重，特別是社交回避傾向的個體。研究旨在通過非侵入性方式（智能手機數據和社交媒體）監測抑鬱症狀。

Method: 使用CNN和Naive Bayes分類器分析手機傳感器數據（識別身體活動）和Twitter互動（情感分析），並採用SVM算法分類抑鬱嚴重程度。

Result: 活動識別準確率達95%，情感分析準確率95.6%。SVM分類抑鬱嚴重程度的準確率為94%，優於其他模型。

Conclusion: 該方法簡單高效，能長期監測抑鬱且不侵犯隱私。

Abstract: Mental disorders including depression, anxiety, and other neurological
disorders pose a significant global challenge, particularly among individuals
exhibiting social avoidance tendencies. This study proposes a hybrid approach
by leveraging smartphone sensor data measuring daily physical activities and
analyzing their social media (Twitter) interactions for evaluating an
individual's depression level. Using CNN-based deep learning models and Naive
Bayes classification, we identify human physical activities accurately and also
classify the user sentiments. A total of 33 participants were recruited for
data acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical
activities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using
the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six
are derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition
accuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter
activities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several
physical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity
of depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support
vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high
accuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer
perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly
effective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal
privacy.

Motivation: 现有方法无法捕捉多变体间的交替因果条件，且处理缺失值和活动变化时存在挑战。需要一种能统一不同因果流程变体并保持模型正确性的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种统一多因果过程变体的方法，保留原始因果模型的正确性并显式表示其因果流交替。该方法经过形式化定义、证明和开源实现。

Result: 在三个公开和两个专有数据集上进行了评估，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法成功统一了多因果过程变体，解决了交替条件和缺失值问题，为业务流程干预提供了更清晰的因果理解。

Abstract: Causal reasoning is essential for business process interventions and
improvement, requiring a clear understanding of causal relationships among
activity execution times in an event log. Recent work introduced a method for
discovering causal process models but lacked the ability to capture alternating
causal conditions across multiple variants. This raises the challenges of
handling missing values and expressing the alternating conditions among log
splits when blending traces with varying activities.
  We propose a novel method to unify multiple causal process variants into a
consistent model that preserves the correctness of the original causal models,
while explicitly representing their causal-flow alternations. The method is
formally defined, proved, evaluated on three open and two proprietary datasets,
and released as an open-source implementation.

Result: 在CochraneForest基准测试中，最佳方法（强化学习训练的小规模数值提取模型）比基于检索的系统F1分数提高了21%，并超越400B参数的大规模通用LLMs 9%。

Conclusion: 数值推理驱动的方法在自动化系统综述证据合成中展现出显著潜力。

Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based
decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central
bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and
determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons.
Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving
relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such
approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the
underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.
Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured
numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain
knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a
numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an
effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference
aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction
model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach
-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a
21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and
outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our
results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating
systematic evidence synthesis.

TL;DR: FMG利用多模态基础模型，通过图像和文本描述分子，学习可解释的分子语言，提升数据效率和化学解释性。

Motivation: 现有分子生成方法依赖专家标注或不可靠的启发式推断，FMG旨在通过多模态基础模型解决这一问题。

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的化学知识，将分子转化为图像和文本描述，并通过提示学习对齐跨模态信息。

Result: FMG在可合成性、多样性和数据效率上表现优异，同时提供化学解释性。

Conclusion: FMG可作为分子生成和性质预测中现有语法学习方法的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent data-efficient molecular generation approaches exploit graph grammars
to introduce interpretability into the generative models. However, grammar
learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for
algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which
leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable
molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG
renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information
across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation
and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability,
diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical
interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows. Code is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Darwin Gödel Machine（DGM），一种通过自我迭代改进代码并利用实证验证的自优化AI系统，灵感来源于达尔文进化和开放式研究，显著提升了代码能力。

Motivation: 当前AI系统架构固定，无法自主持续改进。自动化AI发展可加速其进步。虽然元学习能发现新算法，但局限于一级改进和人为设计的搜索空间。Gödel machine理论上提出自优化AI，但实际证明改进的净效益困难。

Method: DGM通过迭代修改自身代码并利用基准测试验证每次改进。借鉴达尔文进化和开放式研究，维护编码代理档案库，通过基础模型生成新代理版本，形成多样化的代理树并行探索。

Result: DGM在SWE-bench上性能从20.0%提升至50.0%，在Polyglot上从14.2%提升至30.7%，显著优于无自优化或开放式探索的基线。

Conclusion: DGM是自优化AI的重要进展，能够沿无限创新路径自主积累基石。所有实验均采取安全措施（如沙盒、人工监督）。

Abstract: Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot
autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could
itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and
allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the
discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and
the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a
theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in
a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net
beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine
(DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby
also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically
validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution
and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding
agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a
foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent.
This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality
agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the
search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding
capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management,
peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to
50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly
outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All
experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human
oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of
gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless
innovation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了多智能体辩论（MAD）作为测试时计算扩展技术的有效性，揭示了其在数学推理和安全性任务中的表现差异。

Motivation: 尽管多智能体辩论（MAD）被认为能提升推理能力和鲁棒性，但其与单智能体方法在多种条件下的系统对比仍未明确。

Method: 研究将MAD定义为协作精炼和多样化探索的测试时扩展技术，并对比其在数学推理和安全性任务中的表现。

Result: 数学推理任务中，MAD在问题难度高或模型能力低时更有效，但智能体多样性影响有限；安全性任务中，MAD可能增加漏洞，但多样化配置可逐步降低攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来更有效、战略性部署MAD系统提供了关键指导。

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred
exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a
promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD)
approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine
arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse
perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a
systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,
particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to
fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling
technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration
capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD
with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning
and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of
task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key
findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages
over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem
difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little
benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can
increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations
facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative
refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the
future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文回顾了20世纪关于直觉与反思思维的辩论，结合21世纪认知科学与人工智能的研究，提出了一种称为'战略性反思主义'的理论，强调智能系统在直觉与反思间灵活切换以实现目标的重要性。

Motivation: 20世纪的'理性战争'围绕直觉与反思思维展开，挑战了19世纪的理想化理性概念。随着21世纪认知科学将双过程理论应用于人工智能，本文旨在从历史中吸取教训，结合最新研究，探讨智能系统的优化路径。

Method: 通过综合历史理论与近期人类与机器的实验成果，提出'战略性反思主义'理论。该理论基于美国实用主义，并超越了反思思维的表面指标（如模型规模或思维链）。

Result: 提出了'战略性反思主义'，认为智能系统（人类或人工）的关键在于根据实际需要在直觉与反思推理间灵活切换，从而高效实现相互竞争的目标。

Conclusion: 战略性反思主义为智能系统的设计提供了新视角，强调直觉与反思的实用结合，并随着对其价值的深入研究而更具可操作性。

Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the
nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from
mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more
idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st
century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories
to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this
history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from
experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which
takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is
pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally
fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,
transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or
chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about
the value of intuition and reflection.

TL;DR: MenTeR是一个多智能体工作流框架，通过AI代理协作优化模拟电路设计，减少对人工试错的依赖，加速设计周期并扩展设计空间探索。

Motivation: 传统模拟电路设计复杂、耗时，依赖专家经验，MenTeR旨在通过AI协作解决这些问题，提升效率和可靠性。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，涵盖规格理解、电路优化和测试验证等环节，减少人工干预。

Result: MenTeR显著缩短设计周期，增强设计空间探索能力，适用于实际模拟系统。

Conclusion: MenTeR为未来与人类设计师协作的'RF/Analog Copilot'奠定基础。

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with
real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range
of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate,
time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost
efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual
circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an
end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents
that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as
specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation,
MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention.
MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a
broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in
handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork
for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human
designers.

Method: CBR-DDI构建知识库，利用大语言模型提取药理学知识，图神经网络建模药物关联，采用混合检索机制和双层知识增强提示技术，并引入动态案例优化策略。

Result: 实验显示CBR-DDI超越现有大语言模型和案例推理基线，准确率提升28.7%，同时保持高解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: CBR-DDI显著提升药物相互作用预测性能，为临床应用提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is critical for treatment safety.
While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their
effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the
well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar
historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR),
we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles
from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI
constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological
insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid
retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to
effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a
representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR
baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.

TL;DR: 提出了名为“共识机制”的新框架，通过集成专业医学专家代理提高临床决策能力，并在多个医学基准测试中表现优于单一模型架构。

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）的临床应用中，单一模型架构存在过时风险和依赖性过强的问题，需要更灵活、稳健的解决方案。

Method: 采用“共识机制”框架，模拟临床分诊和多学科决策，集成多个医学专家代理。

Result: 在MedXpertQA、MedQA和MedMCQA等基准测试中，准确率显著提升（最高达61.0%），并在DDX+数据集中展示了更高的召回率和精确度。

Conclusion: 共识机制通过多模型集成显著提升了临床决策的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs),
current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome
risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present
a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage
and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism
implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved
clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This
architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency,
or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical
evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the
differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism
achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and
Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an
increase in accuracy on MedQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These
accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system
demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs.
F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX
(Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ =

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Infi-MMR的新框架，旨在通过三个阶段逐步提升多模态小语言模型（MSLMs）的推理能力，并在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的表现。

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理能力上取得了显著进展，但将其扩展到多模态小语言模型（MSLMs）时面临数据稀缺、推理能力退化以及强化学习直接应用可能产生错误推理等问题。因此，需要一种系统化的方法来提升MSLMs的推理能力。

Method: Infi-MMR框架分为三个阶段：1) 基推理能力激活（使用高质量文本推理数据集）；2) 跨模态推理适应（利用带有字幕的多模态数据）；3) 多模态推理增强（使用无字幕的多模态数据减少语言偏见）。最终开发了多模态推理模型Infi-MMR-3B。

Result: Infi-MMR-3B在多模态数学推理（MathVerse testmini 43.68%，MathVision test 27.04%，OlympiadBench 21.33%）和通用推理（MathVista testmini 67.2%）方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过分阶段系统性训练，Infi-MMR成功提升了MSLMs的推理能力，验证了其框架在多模态任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which
leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning
significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision
test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on
MathVista testmini).

TL;DR: MathArena是一个新的评估基准，通过实时使用数学竞赛问题来减少训练数据污染风险，并首次评估LLMs的证明写作能力。

Motivation: 解决现有数学评估数据集可能存在的记忆问题，并填补对证明写作能力评估的空白。

Method: 基于实时发布的数学竞赛问题构建评估框架，避免数据污染，并在五个竞赛中评估30个模型。

Result: 发现AIME 2024存在污染迹象，但在较难竞赛中表现出色；证明写作能力表现较差（USAMO 2025得分<25%）。

Conclusion: MathArena提供了更严格的评估方式，未来将持续追踪LLMs的数学推理进展。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models
(LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However,
many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely
available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from
potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate
proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To
address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following
key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality,
challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By
evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively
eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs
of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions,
such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate
impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also
the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top
models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So
far, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149
problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the
progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and
up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 几何问题解决在人工智能中面临多模态理解和数学推理的双重挑战，现有方法在可靠性和可解释性上存在局限。

Method: AutoGPS结合多模态问题形式化器（MPF）和演绎符号推理器（DSR），MPF将问题转化为形式语言，DSR进行超图扩展任务，生成步骤化解决方案。

Result: 在基准数据集上达到最优性能，人类逐步推理评估显示99%逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: AutoGPS通过神经-符号协作成功解决了几何问题，兼具高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Geometry problem solving presents distinctive challenges in artificial
intelligence, requiring exceptional multimodal comprehension and rigorous
mathematical reasoning capabilities. Existing approaches typically fall into
two categories: neural-based and symbolic-based methods, both of which exhibit
limitations in reliability and interpretability. To address this challenge, we
propose AutoGPS, a neuro-symbolic collaborative framework that solves geometry
problems with concise, reliable, and human-interpretable reasoning processes.
Specifically, AutoGPS employs a Multimodal Problem Formalizer (MPF) and a
Deductive Symbolic Reasoner (DSR). The MPF utilizes neural cross-modal
comprehension to translate geometry problems into structured formal language
representations, with feedback from DSR collaboratively. The DSR takes the
formalization as input and formulates geometry problem solving as a hypergraph
expansion task, executing mathematically rigorous and reliable derivation to
produce minimal and human-readable stepwise solutions. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that AutoGPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, human stepwise-reasoning evaluation confirms
AutoGPS's impressive reliability and interpretability, with 99\% stepwise
logical coherence. The project homepage is at

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework
grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped
to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This
enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions,
including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident
response. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research
by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various
SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to
operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified
through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a
fine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates
human-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing
response coordination, and strategically calibrating trust. This research
systematically presents both the theoretical and practical aspects and
feasibility of designing next-generation cognitive SOCs that leverage AI not to
replace but to enhance human decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAM-Agent是一个基于博弈论的多智能体框架，用于增强视觉-语言推理能力。它通过多个专门处理视觉感知子任务的基础智能体与一个验证逻辑一致性和事实正确性的关键智能体之间的非零和博弈，实现更稳健且可解释的预测。实验显示，该方法显著提升了多种视觉语言模型的性能，尤其是中小规模模型。

Motivation: 现有的单智能体或整体模型在视觉-语言推理中存在局限性，缺乏协作和验证机制。GAM-Agent通过多智能体博弈形式，旨在提高推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: GAM-Agent将推理过程建模为基础智能体（负责视觉感知子任务）与关键智能体（验证逻辑和事实一致性）之间的非零和博弈。智能体通过结构化声明、证据和不确定性估计进行通信，并引入不确定性感知控制器动态调整协作，触发多轮辩论以解决分歧或模糊性。

Result: 在MMMU、MMBench、MVBench和V*Bench等基准测试中，GAM-Agent显著提升了各类视觉语言模型的性能，中小规模模型（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B、InternVL3-14B）准确率提升5-6%，强模型（如GPT-4o）提升2-3%。

Conclusion: GAM-Agent提供了一种模块化、可扩展且通用的多智能体多模态推理方法，为可靠且可解释的推理系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: We propose GAM-Agent, a game-theoretic multi-agent framework for enhancing
vision-language reasoning. Unlike prior single-agent or monolithic models,
GAM-Agent formulates the reasoning process as a non-zero-sum game between base
agents--each specializing in visual perception subtasks--and a critical agent
that verifies logic consistency and factual correctness. Agents communicate via
structured claims, evidence, and uncertainty estimates. The framework
introduces an uncertainty-aware controller to dynamically adjust agent
collaboration, triggering multi-round debates when disagreement or ambiguity is
detected. This process yields more robust and interpretable predictions.
Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and
V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across
various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid
scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances
strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable,
and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent
multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个数学模型，分析了生成式AI（GenAI）与人类工作者在技能互补方面的关系，探讨了二者如何协作而非替代。

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨GenAI工具在职场中与人类工作者的互补关系，而非简单的替代关系。

Method: 通过构建数学模型，将技能分解为决策级和行动级子技能，分析子技能能力变化对工作成功率的影响。

Result: 研究发现，GenAI辅助对低技能工作者的提升效果更显著，且在某些条件下，结合互补子技能的协作方式表现更优。

Conclusion: 结论强调GenAI更可能是人类技能的补充，而非替代，尤其在技能互补的条件下。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has sparked debate over their
role in complementing or replacing human workers across job contexts. We
present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit,
introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and
action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and
GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success,
identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also
establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with
complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker.
This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI
assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the
framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning
real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results
highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing
them.

Result: 识别了错位出现的条件，并提出了缓解风险寻求或风险规避行为的机制。

Conclusion: 该研究提高了在关键资源受限环境中部署AI系统的安全性和可解释性。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed
to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under
(approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have
resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly
terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that
reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these
agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf,
asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated
misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this
setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical
results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify
conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate
the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work
aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of
AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for
safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EVOREFUSE提出了一种进化算法生成伪恶意指令，优化LLMs的过度拒绝问题，并创建了两个数据集，显著提高了拒绝触发率和多样性，同时减少了过度拒绝。

Motivation: 现有方法在生成伪恶意指令时缺乏可扩展性或多样性，导致LLMs过度拒绝，影响用户体验。

Method: EVOREFUSE采用进化算法，通过突变和重组探索指令空间，最大化LLMs拒绝概率的证据下界。

Result: EVOREFUSE-TEST数据集在9个LLMs上拒绝触发率提高140.41%，词汇多样性提升34.86%；LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT训练后过度拒绝减少14.31%。

Conclusion: EVOREFUSE有效解决了LLMs过度拒绝问题，同时揭示了模型过度关注敏感关键词而忽略上下文的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently refuse to respond to pseudo-malicious
instructions: semantically harmless input queries triggering unnecessary LLM
refusals due to conservative safety alignment, significantly impairing user
experience. Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and
mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like
manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to
produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address
these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that
generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting
confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm
exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing
methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed
instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using
EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582
pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with
140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater
lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and
EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with
responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training.
LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to
14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment
dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals
models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while
ignoring broader context.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Socratic-PRMBench，一个用于系统评估过程奖励模型（PRMs）在六种推理模式下的新基准，填补了现有评估仅关注逐步正确性的不足。

Motivation: 现有PRM评估主要关注逐步正确性，缺乏对不同推理模式下错误的系统评估，因此需要新的基准来全面测试PRMs。

Method: 作者提出Socratic-PRMBench，包含2995条带有缺陷的推理路径，涵盖六种推理模式（如转换、分解、验证等），并通过实验评估PRMs和LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验显示现有PRMs在不同推理模式下的评估存在显著缺陷，尤其在错误识别能力上不足。

Conclusion: Socratic-PRMBench为PRMs提供了全面的测试基准，有助于未来PRMs的发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and
problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by
verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to
solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning
patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various
reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks
mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a
systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate
this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs
systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation,
Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.
Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the
aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and
LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing
PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in
conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We
hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic
evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future
development of PRMs.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical
propositions into verifiable formal representations, is a foundational task in
automated theorem proving, offering a new perspective on the use of mathematics
in both theoretical and applied domains. Driven by the rapid progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field
has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique
challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent
advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric
perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various
mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end
workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further
explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability
of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the
trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key
open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open
challenges and promising future directions for the field.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示依赖视觉-语言模型的自主AI在跨模态推理中的安全脆弱性，并提出更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 结合负提示退化和正向语义优化，利用孪生语义网络和布局感知空间掩码，无需模型内部访问。

Result: 在COCO数据集上实现100%攻击成功率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 需开发超越像素级防御的策略，应对跨模态决策中的语义漏洞。

Abstract: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are
rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning
capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that
exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks
typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or
environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world
exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that
manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic
injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive
semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware
spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces
visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI
systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO)
dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios,
TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including
LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such
as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These results expose a
critical vulnerability: Autonomous agents can be consistently misled through
human-imperceptible cross-modal manipulations. These findings highlight the
need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic
vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.

TL;DR: 人们通过元认知强化学习（MCRL）从经验中发现新的规划策略，但模型的学习速度慢于人类。本文研究了引入认知机制（如元认知伪奖励、主观努力估值等）能否缩小模型与人类表现的差距。结果表明这些机制对策略发现有帮助，但未能完全解决问题，需进一步探索其他因素。

Motivation: 探讨如何通过引入认知机制（如元认知伪奖励等）改进MCRL模型，以缩小其与人类在规划策略学习速度上的差距。

Method: 结合元认知伪奖励、主观努力估值和终止决策改进MCRL模型，分析规划任务数据评估这些机制的影响。

Result: 研究发现这些机制能促进策略发现，但仍无法完全弥合模型与人类表现的差距。

Conclusion: 需要进一步探索其他潜在因素以完全解决模型与人类在策略发现上的差距。

Abstract: People employ efficient planning strategies. But how are these strategies
acquired? Previous research suggests that people can discover new planning
strategies through learning from reinforcements, a process known as
metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL). While prior work has shown that
MCRL models can learn new planning strategies and explain more participants'
experience-driven discovery better than alternative mechanisms, it also
revealed significant individual differences in metacognitive learning.
Furthermore, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower rate of
strategy discovery than humans. In this study, we investigate whether
incorporating cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate human strategy
discovery can bring models of MCRL closer to human performance. Specifically,
we consider intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective
effort valuation, and termination deliberation. Analysis of planning task data
shows that a larger proportion of participants used at least one of these
mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage and varying
impacts on strategy discovery. Metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort
valuation, and learning the value of acting without further planning were found
to facilitate strategy discovery. While these enhancements provided valuable
insights into individual differences and the effect of these mechanisms on
strategy discovery, they did not fully close the gap between model and human
performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people
might use to discover new planning strategies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种同步模型抽象（MA）和事件抽象（EA）的方法，以保持模型与底层事件日志的一致性，避免分析时失去真实行为的依据，并通过行为轮廓抽象证明了其可行性。

Motivation: 在过程智能项目中，模型和事件数据的抽象旨在降低复杂性。然而，当前缺乏同步抽象模型和事件日志的技术，导致分析时失去真实行为的依据，限制了分析的深度。

Method: 本文提供了同步模型和事件抽象的形式化基础，证明了通过MA抽象过程模型和从抽象事件日志中发现问题模型的等价性，并提出基于行为轮廓抽象的新EA技术。

Result: 研究证明了同步抽象方法的可行性，并提出了一种非顺序保持的MA技术和相应的EA技术。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了模型和事件日志抽象不同步的问题，为过程分析提供了更可靠的基础，并扩展了抽象技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Model abstraction (MA) and event abstraction (EA) are means to reduce
complexity of (discovered) models and event data. Imagine a process
intelligence project that aims to analyze a model discovered from event data
which is further abstracted, possibly multiple times, to reach optimality
goals, e.g., reducing model size. So far, after discovering the model, there is
no technique that enables the synchronized abstraction of the underlying event
log. This results in loosing the grounding in the real-world behavior contained
in the log and, in turn, restricts analysis insights. Hence, in this work, we
provide the formal basis for synchronized model and event abstraction, i.e., we
prove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model
from an abstracted event log yields an equivalent process model. We prove the
feasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as
non-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly
accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical
ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework
explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven
scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically
inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout
the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate
multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration
monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component.
Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts,
comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30
specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety
performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without
compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate
the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack
methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The

TL;DR: 该论文研究了通过Chain-of-Thought (CoT)监控来增强AI模型的透明度，防止其执行有害行为。通过对比CoT监控与仅监控最终输出的方法，发现CoT在检测隐蔽有害行为上效果更佳，但也存在误导性解释的问题。为此，作者提出了一种混合监控协议，显著提升了检测率。

Motivation: 随着AI模型自主性增强，如何防止其不受监督地执行有害行为成为重要问题。CoT监控作为一种潜在的解决方案，通过监控中间推理步骤来提高模型行为的透明度和可控性。

Method: 论文对比了CoT监控（监控中间推理步骤）与仅监控最终输出的方法。在红队测试中，当模型被指令执行有害任务时，CoT监控表现更好。但发现了CoT跟踪中可能存在的误导性解释问题。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种混合监控协议，独立评分推理和最终输出，并通过加权平均结合。

Result: 实验显示，CoT监控在隐蔽有害行为检测上比仅监控最终输出的方法提高了27个百分点。混合监控协议在所有测试模型和任务中表现最佳，检测率是仅监控最终输出的四倍以上。

Conclusion: CoT监控能显著提升AI模型有害行为的检测能力，尤其是在隐蔽场景中。混合监控协议进一步提升了性能，表明结合推理与输出监控是未来研究的有前景方向。

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure
they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we
investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor
model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful
but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where
only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted
model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding
problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage
points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify
sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that
deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both
reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This
hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors
across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher
than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MAPLE框架，通过有限状态机（FSM）建模移动应用交互，提升GUI代理的任务执行能力和错误恢复。实验验证其在任务成功率、恢复能力和动作准确性上的显著改进。

Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理缺乏对应用导航流程的结构化理解，难以处理上下文、检测异常或错误恢复。MAPLE旨在通过状态感知和动态构建FSM解决这些问题。

Method: MAPLE将UI屏幕建模为FSM中的状态，用户动作为状态转移，并设计多代理系统分工负责规划、执行、验证、错误恢复和知识保留。

Result: 在Mobile-Eval-E和SPA-Bench基准测试中，MAPLE任务成功率提升12%，恢复成功率提升13.8%，动作准确性提高6.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化状态建模对移动GUI代理至关重要。FSM可作为轻量级通用内存层增强未来代理的规划、验证和容错能力。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across
mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable
these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform
interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain
reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model
of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect
unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware
multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine
(FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user
actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation
of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four
phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,
and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs
in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing
the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes
through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by
rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two
challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to
12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results
highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI
agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be
integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic
memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error
recovery.

symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely
underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable
spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula
Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary
answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula
derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its
advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on
seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM
performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks,
enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights
the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一框架ROTATE，通过开放学习过程改进AHT代理与对抗队友生成器，显著提升对未见队友的泛化能力。

Motivation: 现有AHT方法存在队友行为覆盖有限且忽略学习易用性的问题，需统一框架提升泛化能力。

Method: 引入ROTATE算法，通过交替优化AHT代理与生成针对性队友，形成开放学习循环。

Result: 多环境实验表明，ROTATE在未见队友泛化性上显著优于基线。

Conclusion: ROTATE为健壮且泛化的团队协作设立了新标准。

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of collaborating with previously unseen partners
is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad
Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches typically adopt a two-stage
pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the
idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at
deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with
agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on
designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to
algorithms that generate teammate pools with limited coverage of possible
behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn
from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents
typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to
generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control
over the distribution of training teammates. In this paper, we present a
unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended
learning process between an ad hoc agent and an adversarial teammate generator.
We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that
alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe
its deficiencies. Extensive experiments across diverse AHT environments
demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to
an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for
robust and generalizable teamwork.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了NL-FL HybridReasoning框架，通过结合自然语言（NL）和形式语言（FL）的数学推理能力，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLMs）的数学问题解决能力。

Motivation: 当前的强化学习方法在基础模型中难以引入新的能力，尤其是在自然语言和形式语言数学推理的结合上存在挑战。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了一个框架，旨在更有效地将FL专家的知识整合到NL数学问题解决中。

Method: 论文提出了三个关键技术：NL-FL问题对齐方法（将NL的问答问题重新表述为FL的存在定理）、混合问题输入技术（使FL推理器能够同时处理问答和存在问题）以及基于LLM的答案提取机制（解决NL和FL输出格式的差异）。

Result: HybridReasoning框架在MATH-500和AMC基准测试中分别达到了89.80%和84.34%的准确率，比NL基线模型分别提高了4.60%和4.82%。部分问题在NL基线模型中无法解决，但在该框架下得到了解决。

Conclusion: NL-FL HybridReasoning框架通过有效整合NL和FL的推理能力，显著提升了LLMs在数学问题解决中的表现。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered
significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science
communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural
Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the
potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However,
RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base
model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math
reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent
disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To
address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end
framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving.
To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem
Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in
NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*
technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence
problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in
reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves
**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC
benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.
Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL
baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and
operating Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) to autonomously fulfill user
instructions. However, existing approaches usually adopt an offline learning
framework, which faces two core limitations: (1) heavy reliance on high-quality
manual annotations for element grounding and action supervision, and (2)
limited adaptability to dynamic and interactive environments. To address these
limitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for
automating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI
integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance
across OSWorld and AndroidLab environments. The code is available at

Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to
factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This
complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions.
Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control
strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate
limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent
systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making,
enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However,
current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time
adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of
resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to
overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities.
This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for
multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities
in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study
demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and
flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient
resource utilization compared to existing approaches.

Method: 采用因果框架分析稀疏性如何影响信息传播与错误扩散，并设计EIB-leanrner方法融合稠密与稀疏图的连接模式。

Result: 实验表明中等稀疏拓扑能有效抑制错误传播并保留有益信息扩散，EIB-leanrner在性能、通信成本和鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过平衡稀疏与密集拓扑优势，EIB-leanrner为多智能体系统提供了高效且鲁棒的通信拓扑设计方案。

Abstract: The communication topology in large language model-based multi-agent systems
fundamentally governs inter-agent collaboration patterns, critically shaping
both the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making. While
recent studies for communication topology automated design tend to construct
sparse structures for efficiency, they often overlook why and when sparse and
dense topologies help or hinder collaboration. In this paper, we present a
causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous,
propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal
that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation
while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal
task performance. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel topology design
approach, EIB-leanrner, that balances error suppression and beneficial
information propagation by fusing connectivity patterns from both dense and
sparse graphs. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness,
communication cost, and robustness of EIB-leanrner.

Conclusion: VRP-DR模型及FINDER算法能高效解决协作配送问题，为实际物流提供优化方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely,
cost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative
logistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized
multi-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a
fleet of $\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\mathcal{K}$ robots,
cooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the
launching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby
addressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited
range, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic
features: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3)
flexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic
and acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5)
en-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being
transported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle
transit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
to minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational
challenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm,
FINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to
provide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various
instance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in
terms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate
significant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode
and substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also
provides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility,
drone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.

Conclusion: k-DTW是一种高效、强健的差异度量方法，适用于多边形曲线的学习和分类任务。

Abstract: This paper introduces $k$-Dynamic Time Warping ($k$-DTW), a novel
dissimilarity measure for polygonal curves. $k$-DTW has stronger metric
properties than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and is more robust to outliers than
the Fr\'{e}chet distance, which are the two gold standards of dissimilarity
measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and
give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We
prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning
theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the
problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the
curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising
separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW
admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$
when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental
illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest
neighbor classification.

Motivation: 现有模型主要依赖传统流行病学数据，而基因组信息和人类行为数据等替代数据源的潜力尚未充分挖掘，因此研究这些数据在预测病例激增中的作用具有重要意义。

Method: 研究了包括生物特征（如病毒突变）、公共卫生特征（如病例数、政策干预）和人类行为特征（如移动性和社交媒体对话）在内的多模态特征集在预测国家层面病例激增中的有效性。

Result: 结果显示不同国家和特征模态的预测性能存在显著异质性，表明预测模型需要针对特定国家背景和疫情阶段进行定制。

Conclusion: 整合替代数据源可以提升现有疾病监测框架对疫情动态的预测能力。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine
learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality
rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health
interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models
are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative
datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior,
remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of
diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results
highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public
health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features
(e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level
case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive
performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge
prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and
pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating
alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to
enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文解释了Q学习智能体在无限重复游戏中如何学会收取超竞争价格，提出了新的单记忆子博弈完美均衡类别，并分析了不同条件下的学习行为。

Motivation: 旨在从理论上解释Q学习智能体为何会学会收取超竞争价格，特别是在存在单阶段纳什均衡价格和合谋可能价格的情况下。

Method: 通过分析Q函数在试验结束时满足的特定不等式，以及引入单记忆子博弈完美均衡（SPEs）的新类别，研究学习行为。

Result: 证明了在特定条件下，智能体会学会收取超竞争价格，并表明这种行为可以通过天真合谋、冷酷触发策略或递增策略支持。

Conclusion: 天真合谋只有在合谋可能价格为单阶段纳什均衡时才构成SPE，而冷酷触发策略则可以支持SPE。

Abstract: There is growing experimental evidence that $Q$-learning agents may learn to
charge supracompetitive prices. We provide the first theoretical explanation
for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing
policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium
strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium
price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies
certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently
charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame
perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior
is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing
strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the
collusive-enabling price is a one-stage Nash equilibrium, whereas grim trigger
policies can.

TL;DR: NGPU-LM提出了一种针对统计n-gram语言模型的数据结构改进方法，通过优化GPU并行计算，显著提升了ASR任务中上下文偏置的效率，且计算开销低于7%。

Motivation: 现有的统计n-gram语言模型在ASR的上下文偏置任务中缺乏计算效率，尤其是在并行化方面表现不佳，影响了工业应用。

Method: 提出了NGPU-LM方法，重新设计数据结构和贪婪解码，支持多种ASR模型（如transducer、attention encoder-decoder和CTC）。

Result: NGPU-LM在GPU上实现了高效并行计算，计算开销低于7%，并在域外场景中将贪婪搜索与束搜索的精度差距减少了50%以上，同时避免了束搜索带来的显著减速。

Conclusion: NGPU-LM为ASR任务提供了高效且通用的解决方案，其实现已开源。

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks
in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack
computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing
less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for
statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for
GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable
greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers,
attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational
overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap
between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding
significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed
NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合文本、语音和图像的多模态模型，用于处理语音视觉问答（SVQA）任务。通过合成语音数据集进行训练，发现模型性能接近基于文本问答的上限模型，且TTS模型选择对准确性影响较小。

Motivation: 旨在开发一个支持语音和图像输入的问答系统，解决现有数据集中缺乏多模态（文本、语音、图像）数据的问题。

Method: 通过合成VQA数据集，使用零样本TTS模型生成语音数据，构建多模态模型训练SVQA任务。

Result: 模型仅使用合成语音训练时，性能接近文本问答上限模型；TTS模型选择对准确性影响较小。

Conclusion: 多模态融合在SVQA任务中具有潜力，合成语音数据可作为有效替代方案。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language
questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA
system to accept visual and spoken input respectively.
  This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both
speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and
image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting
multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken
questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three
modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by
synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings
indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the
performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we
show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with
GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the
mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the
full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to
over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was
shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the
stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We
use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M
parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming
with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over
the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation
study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We
participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further
improvements.

Abstract: We propose the LCB-CV-UNet to tackle performance degradation caused by High
Dynamic Range (HDR) radar signals. Initially, a hardware-efficient,
plug-and-play module named Logarithmic Connect Block (LCB) is proposed as a
phase coherence preserving solution to address the inherent challenges in
handling HDR features. Then, we propose the Dual Hybrid Dataset Construction
method to generate a semi-synthetic dataset, approximating typical HDR signal
scenarios with adjustable target distributions. Simulation results show about
1% total detection probability improvement with under 0.9% computational
complexity added compared with the baseline. Furthermore, it excels 5% over the
baseline at the range in 11-13 dB signal-to-noise ratio typical for urban
targets. Finally, the real experiment validates the practicality of our model.

Abstract: We investigate the end-to-end altitude estimation performance of a
convolutional autoencoder-based interference mitigation approach for
frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar altimeters. Specifically, we
show that a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) autoencoder effectively
exploits temporal correlations in the received signal, providing superior
interference suppression compared to a Least Mean Squares (LMS) adaptive
filter. Unlike existing approaches, the present method operates directly on the
received FMCW signal. Additionally, we identify key challenges in applying deep
learning to wideband FMCW interference mitigation and outline directions for
future research to enhance real-time feasibility and generalization to
arbitrary interference conditions.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow
signals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS)
methods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory,
we present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming
signals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed
stochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions,
steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the
impact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design
optimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired
estimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g.,
the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that
integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a
distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and
mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world
traffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed
settings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order
topological features.

Motivation: 解决民主进程中的代表性陈述生成问题，克服传统委员会选举中候选集无法直接访问的挑战。

Method: 扩展了生成社会选择框架，支持近似最优查询和预算限制，使用GPT-4o实现查询。

Result: 在城市改进措施和药物评论数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效从非结构化用户意见中生成代表性陈述列表。

Abstract: A key task in certain democratic processes is to produce a concise slate of
statements that proportionally represents the full spectrum of user opinions.
This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings,
the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so
it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and
large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a
framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two
fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of
approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the
slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets
related to city improvement measures and drug reviews, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating representative slates from unstructured user

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文研究了在有限时间$T$内与$K\geq 2$种类型代理的重复主从博弈问题，目标是设计激励策略以最小化后悔。

Motivation: 研究在无先验知识下主从博弈问题的可解性，探索两种可实现次线性后悔的关键设定。

Method: 提出两种算法：第一种基于已知代理贪婪选择行为，第二种基于代理响应平滑性（Lipschitz条件）。

Result: 在已知贪婪行为设定下，后悔上界为$O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$；在平滑响应设定下，后悔上界为$\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$，均匹配下界。

Conclusion: 在特定条件下可实现次线性后悔，扩展算法支持单轮多臂激励。

Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite
horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of
agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal
strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent
of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the
provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The
objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight.
Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes
intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where
sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the
arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this
setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of
$O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to
a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly
with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under
this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of
$\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to
logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both
settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously
in each round.

Conclusion: MAGIC有望成为一种无对比剂、经济高效的快速灌注成像方法，革新医疗影像领域。

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and
tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging
plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.
While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood
flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic
reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion
worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT
perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial
intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We
demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological
characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated
using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and
demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A
double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced
neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's
visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared
to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall,
MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering
contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.

Motivation: 非绝热耦合（NAC）对光化学和光物理过程的模拟至关重要，但其向量化、双值特性及圆锥交叉附近的奇异性使得机器学习NAC极具挑战性。

Method: 设计了NAC专用描述符，并提出新的ML相位校正流程，结合MLatom开源工具实现了高精度学习。

Result: 在富烯的SA-2-CASSCF(6,6)电子结构水平模拟中，ML-FSSH动力学准确描述了S₁衰减，误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅突破了NAC机器学习的精度瓶颈，还为大规模轨迹模拟提供了高效工具，推动了光化学动力学研究。

Abstract: Nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) play a crucial role in modeling photochemical
and photophysical processes with methods such as the widely used
fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH). There is therefore a strong incentive
to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is
challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity
near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific
descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning
NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to
success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the
efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully
ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic
structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of
$S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large
ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source
MLatom.

Result: 综合复杂度分析表明，新算法显著降低了$k$NN类算法的时间复杂度。

Conclusion: GB-Q$k$NN通过创新的粒球和量子化技术，成功解决了$k$NN算法效率低下的问题。

Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have
made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large
amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm
called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves
higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data
size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the
time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via
quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search
process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW
method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and
significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as
revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.

Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data,
designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information
remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to
be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While
there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence
for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding
tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the
classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness
of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree
polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree
hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for
learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it
to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a
challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To
our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework
was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree
hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with
single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and
identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for
protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity
landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more
entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning
Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

Conclusion: 通过结合变分量子算法和在线共形推理，动态VQS框架为NISQ设备上的量子传感提供了可靠且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of
classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection
to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling
constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack
rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control
framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while
providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online
conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation
sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum
magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the
required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The
results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum
algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing
on NISQ devices.

classifies existing approaches into two categories: (1) Pure LLM Recommenders,
which rely solely on LLMs, and (2) Augmented LLM Recommenders, which integrate
additional non-LLM techniques to enhance performance. This taxonomy provides a
novel lens through which to examine the evolving landscape of LLM-based
recommendation. To support fair comparison, we introduce a unified evaluation

conclude by discussing open challenges and outlining promising directions for

Result: 在BEIR和BRIGHT基准测试中，检索性能（nDCG@10）提升3.4%，同时token使用减少74.4%。

Conclusion: SMR是一种无需任务特定调优的通用解决方案，优于传统CoT推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However,
it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and
semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key
challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and
misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we
propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework
composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping
and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show
that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token
usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring
task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT
reasoning. The code and details are available at https://github.com/ldilab/SMR.

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the Deep Retrieval team for subtask
4b of the CLEF CheckThat! 2025 competition, which focuses on retrieving
relevant scientific literature for given social media posts. To address this
task, we propose a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines lexical precision,
semantic generalization, and deep contextual re-ranking, enabling robust
retrieval that bridges the informal-to-formal language gap. Specifically, we
combine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a
fine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns
the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are
then merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.
  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the
development set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on
the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31
teams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to
the top-ranked system. We achieve this strong performance by running
open-source models locally and without external training data, highlighting the
effectiveness of a carefully designed and fine-tuned retrieval pipeline.

Abstract: A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when
guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For
example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be
both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper
crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical
for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion
for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the
new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with
atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts
atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their
user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to
rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system
development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are
manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially
generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect
utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic
selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based
judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that
serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with
ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual
annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we
hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in
this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go
beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.

Abstract: Accurately modeling time-continuous stochastic processes from irregular
observations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we leverage ideas
from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series
generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes,
inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of
the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the
underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled
Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding
Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are
able to handle irregularly sampled time series.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling,
typically relying on optimizing neural networks to estimate the score function
via forward SDE simulations. In this work, we propose an alternative method
that is both optimization-free and forward SDE-free. By expanding the score
function in a sparse set of eigenbasis of the backward Kolmogorov operator
associated with the diffusion process, we reformulate score estimation as the
solution to a linear system, avoiding iterative optimization and time-dependent
sample generation. We analyze the approximation error using perturbation theory
and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-dimensional Boltzmann
distributions and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: MIAS-SAM是一种用于医学图像异常区域分割的新方法，利用基于记忆块的补丁提取特征并比较生成异常图，无需阈值设置即可精确分割。

Motivation: 现有方法需要手动设置阈值来获得分割结果，MIAS-SAM旨在消除这一限制，提高异常分割的准确性。

Conclusion: MIAS-SAM无需阈值设置即可实现精确的异常分割，适用于多种医学成像模态。

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of
anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to
store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the
SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM
encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map.
Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt
the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously
extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to
define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.
Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with
a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show
accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIMTS是一个基于视觉掩码自编码器（MAE）的框架，用于处理不规则多变量时间序列（IMTS）预测问题，通过特征补全和自监督学习提升性能。

Motivation: 现有的方法在处理IMTS时难以捕捉可靠的时序模式，而预训练的基础模型通常是为规则时间序列设计的。

Method: VIMTS将IMTS沿时间线分割为等间隔特征块，利用跨通道依赖关系补全缺失数据，并通过视觉MAE进行块重建和粗到细预测。

Result: 实验表明VIMTS在性能和少样本学习能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VIMTS成功扩展了视觉基础模型在通用时间序列任务中的应用。

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to
the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive
missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns
from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation
models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically
designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask
AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel
information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework
adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing
values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at
equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned
cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in
handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a
coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.
In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling
by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application
of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/WHU-HZY/VIMTS.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that
seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and
fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior
methods that address these motion types through separate modules or
task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting
user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video
generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify
keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire
object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected
trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally
consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework
demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks,
including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint
changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our
method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality
compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly
compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones. Project

TL;DR: 论文提出一个基于Minecraft的数据集和基准，用于促进空间一致性世界模型的开发，重点在于长期空间一致性的学习和评估。

Motivation: 当前数据集和基准主要关注视觉连贯性或生成质量，缺乏对长期空间一致性的要求，而空间一致性是实现高质量视觉生成和可靠世界模型的关键。

Method: 通过在Minecraft开放世界中采集150个不同位置的循环导航视频（约250小时，2000万帧），并采用逐步增加序列长度的课程设计，以学习复杂导航轨迹中的空间一致性。

Result: 构建了数据集和基准，评估了四种代表性世界模型基线，并开源了数据、基准和代码。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了现有数据集在空间一致性学习方面的空白，为未来研究提供了可扩展的数据和评估框架。

Abstract: The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了低资源语言文档VQA的性能，并公开数据集和代码以推动多语言文档VQA研究。

Abstract: Modern VLMs have achieved near-saturation accuracy in English document visual
question-answering (VQA). However, this task remains challenging in lower
resource languages due to a dearth of suitable training and evaluation data. In
this paper we present scalable methods for curating such datasets by focusing
on Hungarian, approximately the 17th highest resource language on the internet.
Specifically, we present HuDocVQA and HuDocVQA-manual, document VQA datasets
that modern VLMs significantly underperform on compared to English DocVQA.
HuDocVQA-manual is a small manually curated dataset based on Hungarian
documents from Common Crawl, while HuDocVQA is a larger synthetically generated
VQA data set from the same source. We apply multiple rounds of quality
filtering and deduplication to HuDocVQA in order to match human-level quality
in this dataset. We also present HuCCPDF, a dataset of 117k pages from
Hungarian Common Crawl PDFs along with their transcriptions, which can be used
for training a model for Hungarian OCR. To validate the quality of our
datasets, we show how finetuning on a mixture of these datasets can improve
accuracy on HuDocVQA for Llama 3.2 11B Instruct by +7.2%. Our datasets and code
will be released to the public to foster further research in multilingual
DocVQA.

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified vision-language models (VLMs), which integrate
both visual understanding and generation capabilities, have attracted
significant attention. The underlying hypothesis is that a unified architecture
with mixed training on both understanding and generation tasks can enable
mutual enhancement between understanding and generation. However, this
hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address
this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across
understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a
dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive
experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM
architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First,
unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding
and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can
scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input
and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge
acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this
cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond
modality adapters. Our findings underscore the critical necessity of unifying
understanding and generation in VLMs, offering valuable insights for the design
and optimization of unified VLMs.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is the ability of generalizing novel
compositions from seen primitives, and has received much attention in
vision-and-language (V\&L) recently. Due to the multi-modal nature of V\&L
tasks, the primitives composing compositions source from different modalities,
resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization
ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced
compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a
retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA
models by learning unified representations for primitives from different
modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for
each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are
aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps
the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives
across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we
construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples
include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different
modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.

Conclusion: GeoMan通过创新的架构和表示方法，有效解决了3D人体几何估计中的长期挑战。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos
is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily
optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and
fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we
present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and
temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.
GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training
data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.
To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to
estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then
conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as
an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of
geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role
to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video
datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and
generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the
challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth
representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be
estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional
affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D
human geometry estimation from videos.

Motivation: 传统EEG信号分类方法依赖于特定任务的数据采集和设备，缺乏通用性。本研究旨在开发一种能够适应不同设备和多通道EEG数据的统一框架。

Method: 作者提出了EAD框架，基于现有的EEG基础模型进行了显著改进，以学习鲁棒的EEG表示用于分类任务。

Conclusion: EAD框架能够有效处理不同设备和多通道EEG数据，在多种感知任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) has been a popular modality for neural
decoding, it often involves task specific acquisition of the EEG data. This
poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings
for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various
decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal
preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly
dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same
pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same
experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the
development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly
beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with
varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a
flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More
specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant
adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the
classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets
achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and
BrainLat respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
framework across diverse EEG datasets containing two different perception
tasks: stimulus and resting-state EEG signals. We also perform zero-shot EEG
classification on EEG-ImageNet task to demonstrate the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: VScan通过优化令牌处理显著提升效率，为大型视觉语言模型的实时部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal
understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding.
However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer
visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate
this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at
the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language
model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their
effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are
processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided
by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction
framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary
global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2)
introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive
experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in
accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current
state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a
10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original
performance.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency
evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon
VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural
nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still
lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating
the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper
argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural
studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of
images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks,
corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more
complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Zero-to-Hero的新方法，通过参考编辑和条件生成模型改进视频编辑的准确性和一致性，PSNR提升了2.6 dB。

Motivation: 现有文本引导的方法在用户意图表达和细粒度控制方面存在模糊性，需要一种更精准的视频编辑方法。

Method: 提出参考编辑框架，先编辑锚帧作为参考，再通过注意力机制传播到其他帧；并结合条件生成模型解决图像退化问题。

Result: 在PSNR指标上比最佳基线提高了2.6 dB，并验证了时间一致性。

Conclusion: Zero-to-Hero方法在视频编辑的准确性和一致性上表现优异，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video
editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user
intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of
objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach
named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that
disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this
by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference
image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We
leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention
mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or
temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when
dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot
initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However,
intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging
degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting
from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative
model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the
appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using
Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method
outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowAlign提出了一种无反转的基于流的框架，通过引入流匹配损失作为正则化机制，解决了图像编辑过程中的轨迹不稳定和源一致性问题，显著提升了编辑的可控性和一致性。

Motivation: 现有的无反转流式图像编辑方法（如FlowEdit）存在轨迹不稳定和源一致性差的问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: FlowAlign通过引入流匹配损失作为正则化机制，平衡语义对齐与源图像结构一致性，并支持逆向编辑。

Result: 实验证明FlowAlign在源图像保留和编辑可控性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowAlign为基于流的图像编辑提供了更稳定、一致的解决方案，未来可扩展至其他类似任务。

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit
leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3,
enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these
methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source
consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel
inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with
principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a
regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories
during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to
explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural
consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign
naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory,
highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods
in both source preservation and editing controllability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需解码器、微调或训练的CLIP图像合成方法，通过频率感知隐式神经表示实现文本到图像生成等功能。

Motivation: 探索判别式模型CLIP在未改变权重情况下是否具有生成潜力，挑战传统生成式模型依赖解码器的观念。

Method: 结合频率感知隐式神经表示、对抗鲁棒初始化、正交Procrustes投影和混合损失，优化图像合成过程。

Result: 成功实现文本到图像生成、风格迁移和图像重建，证明判别式模型具有隐藏的生成能力。

Conclusion: 揭示了判别式模型的未开发生成潜力，为生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared
embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of
many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared
space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is
nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or
fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural
representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying
frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we
introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal
Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending
loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's
weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation,
style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that
discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain
sight.

Abstract: The rise of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled the synthesis of
photorealistic human portraits, raising serious concerns about identity misuse
and the robustness of AIGC detectors. In this work, we propose an automated
adversarial prompt generation framework that leverages a grammar tree structure
and a variant of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm to systematically
explore the semantic prompt space. Our method generates diverse, controllable
prompts that consistently evade both open-source and commercial AIGC detectors.
Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models validate its effectiveness,
and the approach ranked first in a real-world adversarial AIGC detection
competition. Beyond attack scenarios, our method can also be used to construct
high-quality adversarial datasets, providing valuable resources for training
and evaluating more robust AIGC detection and defense systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMamba框架通过结合SAM2的分层特征学习和Mamba的选择性序列建模，提出创新的模块（FS-Adapter、CSI、DPCF），显著提升红外小目标检测性能，尤其在复杂背景下。

Motivation: 红外小目标检测（ISTD）在军事等领域至关重要，但现有深度学习方法存在信息丢失和全局上下文建模效率低的问题。

Method: 提出SAMamba框架，包含FS-Adapter（双阶段选择域适应）、CSI（线性复杂度的全局建模）和DPCF（多尺度特征平衡融合）。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在背景复杂和目标尺度多变的场景中。

Conclusion: SAMamba通过域适应、细节保留和长距离依赖建模，有效解决了ISTD核心挑战。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance
in military, maritime, and early warning applications. ISTD is challenged by
targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from
complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from
information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.
This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical
feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations
include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient
natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level
with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)
A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global
context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;
and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively
combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance
high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses
core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained
details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on
NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with
heterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales. Code:

TL;DR: 论文介绍了R2I-Bench，一个专门评估文本到图像生成（T2I）中推理能力的基准测试，并提出了R2IScore作为细粒度评估指标，显示当前T2I模型在推理能力上的局限性。

Motivation: 当前T2I模型在生成逼真图像方面取得了显著进展，但其推理能力仍未得到充分发展和评估，特别是在复杂的场景理解中。

Method: 设计了R2I-Bench基准测试和R2IScore评估指标，通过16种代表性T2I模型的实验验证，并采用基于管道的框架将推理与生成解耦。

Result: 实验结果显示当前T2I模型的推理能力普遍受限，强调了下一代T2I系统需要更强大的推理感知架构。

Conclusion: R2I-Bench为T2I模型的推理能力评估提供了有效工具，揭示了未来研究中加强推理能力的重要性。

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

Conclusion: 多模态方法和无监督训练框架有效解决了现有标注数据不足的问题，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can
be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and
highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine
video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and
highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the
best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In
this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and
their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the
video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is
trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse
and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments
with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training
allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the
challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our
experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight
detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual
content of the video.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may
vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of
jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL
and its potential in multimodal learning. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FUSS的新型联邦学习方法，用于无监督语义图像分割（USS），解决了分布式客户端在数据分布不均且无监督情况下的特征表示和聚类中心对齐问题。

Motivation: 探索联邦学习在无监督语义图像分割中的应用，解决分布式环境下特征和聚类中心对齐的难题。

Method: 提出FUSS框架，通过新颖的联邦策略实现特征和原型空间的全局一致性，联合优化本地分割头和共享语义中心。

Result: 在基准和真实数据集上的实验表明，FUSS在多种数据分布下优于本地客户端训练和经典联邦学习算法扩展。

Conclusion: FUSS是首个实现完全去中心化、无标签语义分割训练的框架，为无监督联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised
Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level
features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through
self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are
then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending
these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster
centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task
under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To
address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic
Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully
decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel
federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype
space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic
centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including
binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently
outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL
algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility,
full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为VF-Eval的新基准，用于全面评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在AI生成内容（AIGC）视频上的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并通过RePrompt实验展示了改进视频生成的潜力。

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注自然视频的评估，而忽略了AIGC视频的评估。同时，MLLMs在AIGC视频理解方面的能力尚未充分探索，因此需要新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出VF-Eval基准，包含四项任务（一致性验证、错误意识、错误类型检测和推理评估），并在13个前沿MLLMs上进行测试。此外，通过RePrompt实验探讨了如何通过对齐人类反馈改进视频生成。

Result: 实验表明，即使是表现最佳的GPT-4.1模型，在所有任务中均未表现一致优秀，凸显了基准的挑战性。RePrompt实验验证了通过对齐人类反馈可优化视频生成。

Conclusion: VF-Eval基准揭示了MLLMs在AIGC视频理解上的局限性，并展示了通过人类反馈改进的潜力，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in
human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the
development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and
anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this
gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for
pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and
patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained
CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into
non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a
projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using
prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text
encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and
text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.
Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic
and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We
also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of
adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains
(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the
pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however,
probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image
spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,
a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision
researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,
unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired
with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We
conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model
attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while
humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench
and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated
reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that
diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)
overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation
reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for
advancing multi-image spatial intelligence. Project page:

Motivation: 通过强化学习微调生成模型，以更紧密地符合人类偏好，尤其是针对复杂奖励信号（如美学预测和CLIP嵌入）的应用。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）微调视觉自回归（VAR）模型，结合CLIP嵌入实现风格控制。

Conclusion: 强化学习微调对VAR模型高效且有效，尤其得益于其快速的推理速度，适合在线采样。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with
nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual
autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this
approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic
predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and
enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by
leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial
ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate
images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during
pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient
and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference
speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses
significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused
by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a
fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect
pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to
spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present.
To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment
framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS
modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a
single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's
high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we
introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism
that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa,
enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$
faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets,
showing its robustness across different conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VModA框架，有效检测复杂NSFW内容，适应多样化规则，实验显示准确率提升54.3%。

Motivation: NSFW内容在社交媒体泛滥，现有检测方法难以应对复杂语义和多样化规则。

Method: 提出VModA框架，适应不同审核规则并处理复杂语义NSFW内容。

Result: VModA准确率提升54.3%，适应性强，并修正了公共数据集标签问题。

Conclusion: VModA在复杂NSFW检测中表现优异，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Not Safe/Suitable for Work (NSFW) content is rampant on social networks and
poses serious harm to citizens, especially minors. Current detection methods
mainly rely on deep learning-based image recognition and classification.
However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways,
often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or
attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often
evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further
complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create
additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and
reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective
framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex,
semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show
that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3%
accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics.
Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability
across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent
and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated
them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have
confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world
scenarios to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdiDub是一种新颖的视觉配音框架，通过内容感知编辑任务改进现有方法的局限性，显著提升了身份保护和同步效果。

Motivation: 视觉配音在多语言内容传播中至关重要，但现有方法在无缝集成和保留视觉信息方面存在不足。

Method: EdiDub将视觉配音重新定义为内容感知编辑任务，采用专用条件方案确保忠实修改而非简单复制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，EdiDub显著提升了身份保护和同步效果，并在人类评估中获得更高的同步性和视觉自然性评分。

Conclusion: 内容感知编辑方法在保留复杂视觉元素和准确唇同步方面优于传统生成或修复技术。

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is
crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling
broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations.
Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless
integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard
vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This
work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a
content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by
utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate
modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a
challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity
preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores
compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our
content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or
inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring
accurate lip synchronization.

Conclusion: CryoCCD通过结合生成技术与物理模型，有效解决了冷冻电镜数据稀缺问题，提升了分析性能。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

Conclusion: DeepChest为医学诊断中的深度学习提供了更高效、实用的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: While Multi-Task Learning (MTL) offers inherent advantages in complex domains
such as medical imaging by enabling shared representation learning, effectively
balancing task contributions remains a significant challenge. This paper
addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel,
computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework
specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike
existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial
overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on
effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture
(e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task
importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing
memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be
easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only
outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also
yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved
generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency
and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust
deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications. The

Motivation: 解决传统视频标记方法在摄像机移动时性能下降和标记减少有限的问题。

Method: 提出基于全景子对象轨迹的标记范式TrajViT，结合对比学习训练。

Result: TrajViT在视频文本检索任务中比ViT3D高出6% top-5召回率，标记减少10倍；作为视频编码器，在6个VideoQA基准上平均性能提升5.2%，训练时间快4倍，推理FLOPs减少18倍。

Conclusion: TrajViT首次在多样化视频分析任务中一致优于ViT3D，成为高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

Motivation: 传统特征提取方法对输入数据的小变化敏感，导致特征表示大变化；PH因其对数据扰动的鲁棒性，提供了更稳定的特征表示。

Method: 通过比较聚合持久条形码与拼接拓扑特征向量两种方法，在不同医学影像数据集上进行分类模型性能分析。

Result: 特征拼接方法保留了单个条形码的详细拓扑信息，分类性能更优。

Conclusion: 在进行类似实验时，拼接拓扑特征向量是更优选择。

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the
design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH),
from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and
stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional
feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large
change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and
geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars
represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical
information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D
medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological
feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by
featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each
barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned
approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this
analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological
information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance
and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

TL;DR: VOT task faces challenges like appearance changes and occlusions. Traditional trackers struggle, but VLMs show promise. CLDTracker proposes a dual-branch framework with rich textual descriptions from VLMs (CLIP, GPT-4V), achieving SOTA performance.

Motivation: 传统视觉目标跟踪（VOT）方法在复杂场景（如动态外观变化、遮挡）中表现不佳，而视觉语言模型（VLMs）在语义理解方面展现潜力但存在文本表示不足、特征融合效率低等问题。

Method: 提出CLDTracker，采用双分支架构（文本分支和视觉分支），利用CLIP和GPT-4V生成丰富的目标文本描述，结合语义和上下文线索。

Result: 在六个标准VOT基准测试中取得SOTA性能，验证了基于VLMs的鲁棒时适应性视觉语言表征的有效性。

Conclusion: CLDTracker通过增强文本表示和高效特征融合，提升了VOT任务性能，展示了VLMs在跟踪领域的潜力。

Abstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to
dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional
trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex
scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic
understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,
suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to
VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and
comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target
object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;
inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and
textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack
of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language
domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the
object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full
potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive
Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker
introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual
branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions
derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with
semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual
representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that
CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of
leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for
tracking. Code and models are publicly available at:

Result: 相比其他预训练策略，SLIMP在下游皮肤病变分类任务中表现更优，证明了其学习表示的质量。

Conclusion: SLIMP通过充分利用多模态数据，显著提升了皮肤病变分类的准确性。

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning
rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive
learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and
metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on
images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging
conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical
and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for
assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be
malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history
as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this,
SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with
patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically
relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities
throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves
performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin
lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition

multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce
CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein
GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating
multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints.
Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is
introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on
composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers.
Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures
residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally,
off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose
geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and
manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models.
Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD
reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing
methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,
images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging
recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD
reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.
Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage
pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated
data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online
feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL
fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such
as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline
alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing
single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More
importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three
challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

Abstract: Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep
generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video
generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant
challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high
generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for
any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable
coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images
and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic
masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various
subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without
architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism
that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features.
Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from
single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent
synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also
introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable,

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often underperform in real-world, dynamic
settings where data distributions change over time. Domain Incremental Learning
(DIL) offers a solution by enabling continual model adaptation, with
Parameter-Isolation DIL (PIDIL) emerging as a promising paradigm to reduce
knowledge conflicts. However, existing PIDIL methods struggle with parameter
selection accuracy, especially as the number of domains and corresponding
classes grows. To address this, we propose SOYO, a lightweight framework that
improves domain selection in PIDIL. SOYO introduces a Gaussian Mixture
Compressor (GMC) and Domain Feature Resampler (DFR) to store and balance prior
domain data efficiently, while a Multi-level Domain Feature Fusion Network
(MDFN) enhances domain feature extraction. Our framework supports multiple
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and is validated across tasks
such as image classification, object detection, and speech enhancement.
Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate SOYO's consistent

Conclusion: TrustVLM无需重新训练便能提高VLM的可靠性，为其在实际应用中的安全部署提供了可能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications
in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and
transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,
often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a
significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can
lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a
training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of
estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed
modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly
represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring
function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We
rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4
architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95
compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model
without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of
VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADA是一种用于视觉语言模型持续学习的框架，通过添加轻量级标签特定内存单元，避免参数划分导致的性能下降，实现最先进的效果。

Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的方法通过划分参数集适应不同任务，导致推理时参数选择错误，性能下降。因此需要一种更高效的方法来保持分类性能。

Method: LADA在冻结的CLIP图像编码器后添加轻量级标签特定内存单元，聚合任务无关知识生成判别特征，并通过特征蒸馏防止旧类特征被干扰。

Result: LADA在持续学习任务中表现优异，实现了当前最优性能（state-of-the-art）。

Conclusion: LADA通过避免参数划分与特征蒸馏策略，显著提升了持续学习的性能与稳定性。

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway
toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable
representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image
encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a
partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for
input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades
performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific
ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends
lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder,
enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic
knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature
distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered
with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient
flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive
results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual
learning settings. The implementation code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimePoint是一种自监督方法，通过从合成数据中学习关键点和描述符，显著加速DTW对齐并提高准确性。

Motivation: DTW在时间序列对齐中存在可扩展性差和对噪声敏感的问题，需要更高效且准确的方法。

Method: 利用1D微分同胚和全卷积/小波卷积架构，从合成数据中提取关键点和描述符，然后应用DTW稀疏表示。

Result: TimePoint在速度和对齐准确性上均优于标准DTW，且仅用合成数据训练即可泛化到真实数据。

Conclusion: TimePoint为时间序列分析提供了可扩展的高效解决方案，代码开源。

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further
improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than
standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis. Our code

TL;DR: OmniEarth-Bench是首个全面的地球科学多模态基准测试，覆盖六大地球科学领域及其交叉领域，包含100个专家策划的评估维度，揭示了当前先进模型在复杂任务中的不足。

Motivation: 现有地球科学多模态学习基准在系统覆盖范围和评估维度上存在不足，局限在单一子系统中。为了填补这一空白，提出了OmniEarth-Bench。

Method: 整合卫星传感器和实地测量数据，通过专家和众包标注，构建包含29,779个注释的四个层级评估体系（感知、通用推理、科学知识推理和链式推理）。

Result: 实验表明，9个最先进的多模态大模型在OmniEarth-Bench上表现不佳，最高准确率不到35%，某些交叉领域任务中GPT-4o的准确率甚至为0%。

Conclusion: OmniEarth-Bench为地球科学AI设立了新标准，推动了科学发现和环境监测、灾害预测的实际应用。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Earth science multimodal learning exhibit critical
limitations in systematic coverage of geosystem components and cross-sphere
interactions, often constrained to isolated subsystems (only in
Human-activities sphere or atmosphere) with limited evaluation dimensions (less
than 16 tasks). To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first
comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres
(atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and
Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated
evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and
in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four
tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per
sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant
observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for
annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd
workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs
reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where
none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the
performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets
a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and
practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The
dataset, source code, and trained models were released.

TL;DR: 论文提出Qwen-LA模型，通过视觉-文本反射过程减少幻觉，并引入BRPO方法平衡反射，提升视觉注意力。

Motivation: 现有视觉语言推理模型（VLRMs）因长推理导致视觉信息被忽视，引发幻觉问题。仅靠文本反射不足以解决。

Method: 提出Qwen-LA模型，结合视觉-文本反射，通过BRPO方法动态决定反射时机，并引入Visual Token COPY/ROUTE强制模型重新关注视觉信息。

Result: 实验显示Qwen-LA在多视觉QA数据集和幻觉指标上表现领先，准确率提升且幻觉减少。

Conclusion: 视觉-文本反射和视觉信息补充有效增强VLRMs的注意力，减少幻觉，提升性能。

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance
of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language
Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,
causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger
hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows
promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress
hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain
(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a
vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual
information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method
Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to
decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the
number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose
attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that
supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.
Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token
ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at
the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.
Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate
that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing
hallucinations. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: BinauralFlow是一种基于流匹配的流式双耳语音合成框架，解决了双耳渲染的质量和实时性问题。

Motivation: 传统双耳音频合成方法在渲染质量和实时性上表现不佳，需要精确建模双耳线索、房间混响和环境音。

Method: 采用条件流匹配模型和因果U-Net架构，结合流式STFT/ISTFT操作、缓冲池、中点求解器和提前跳过策略。

Result: 定量和定性评估显示其优于现有方法，感知研究表明其与真实录音的混淆率达42%。

Conclusion: BinauralFlow在双耳音频合成的质量和实时性上取得了显著突破。

Abstract: Binaural rendering aims to synthesize binaural audio that mimics natural
hearing based on a mono audio and the locations of the speaker and listener.
Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle
with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality
binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires
precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds.
Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address
these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech
synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a
generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional
flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal
U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past
information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we
introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT
operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to
improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches. A
perceptual study further reveals that our model is nearly indistinguishable
from real-world recordings, with a $42\%$ confusion rate.

Abstract: Auscultation is crucial for diagnosing lung diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic
has revealed the limitations of traditional, in-person lung sound assessments.
To overcome these issues, advancements in digital stethoscopes and artificial
intelligence (AI) have led to the development of new diagnostic methods. In
this context, our study aims to use smartphone microphones to record and
analyze lung sounds. We faced two major challenges: the difference in audio
style between electronic stethoscopes and smartphone microphones, and the
variability among patients. To address these challenges, we developed a method
called Patient Domain Supervised Contrastive Learning (PD-SCL). By integrating
this method with the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model, we
significantly improved its performance by 2.4\% compared to the original AST
model. This progress demonstrates that smartphones can effectively diagnose
lung sounds, addressing inconsistencies in patient data and showing potential
for broad use beyond traditional clinical settings. Our research contributes to
making lung disease detection more accessible in the post-COVID-19 world.

(http://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey). We first outline the motivations and
design principles behind our hardware nasalance system, and then present a
comparison between Nosey and a commercial nasalance device. Nosey shows
consistently higher nasalance scores than the commercial device, but the
magnitude of contrast between phonological environments is comparable between
systems. We also review ways of customizing the hardware to facilitate testing,
such as comparison of microphones and different construction materials. We
conclude that Nosey is a flexible and cost-effective alternative to commercial
nasometry devices and propose some methodological considerations for its use in
data collection.

TL;DR: MGE-LDM是一个统一的潜在扩散框架，用于同时实现音乐生成、声源填充和基于查询的声源分离，支持灵活的任意乐器源操作。

Motivation: 先前的方法受限于固定的乐器类别，MGE-LDM旨在学习完整的混音、子混音和单独音轨的联合分布。

Method: MGE-LDM通过将分离和填充任务定义为潜在空间中的条件修复任务，实现了对任意乐器源的类无关操作。

Conclusion: MGE-LDM提供了一种灵活且高效的方法，用于音乐处理和生成的多任务学习。

Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous
music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike
prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a
joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within
a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1)
complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation),
and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both
separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space,
our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary
instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across
heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without
relying on predefined instrument categories. Audio samples are available at our

Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) has revolutionized the construction
industry by providing a comprehensive digital representation of building

effective methods for capturing the complex spatial and topological

proposes a unified network-based representation method that integrates the
"semantic-spatial-topological" multi-dimensional design features of BIM models.
By extending the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) standard, we introduce local
spatial relationships and topological connections between components to enrich
the network structure. This representation method enables a more detailed
understanding of component interactions, dependencies, and implicit design
patterns, effectively capturing the semantic, topological, and spatial
relationships in BIM, and holds significant potential for the representation
and learning of design patterns.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文质疑现有恶意软件分类器在分布偏移下的可靠性，并提出AURORA框架评估其置信度质量和操作弹性，指出当前方法在操作稳定性上的不足。

Motivation: 现有评估范式过于关注基线性能指标，忽视了置信误差对齐和操作稳定性，导致实际应用中的可靠性存疑。

Method: 提出AURORA框架，通过验证模型的置信度轮廓来评估其估计的可靠性，并设计了一套超越即时性能的指标。

Result: 实验发现当前最先进框架在不同漂移严重程度的数据集上表现脆弱。

Conclusion: 需要重新审视现有方法，AURORA为更全面的操作稳定性评估提供了方向。

Abstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear
promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The
standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics,
neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While
TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a
complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain
reliable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the
tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not.
We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their
confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence
profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its
estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste
valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and
leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. AURORA is
further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time
performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational
stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in
state-of-the-art frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests
the need for a return to the whiteboard.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 研究发现AI生成内容标签对识别虚假信息有一定帮助，但用户可能过度依赖标签，且标签存在误用的副作用，如提高人类制作虚假信息的可信度。

Motivation: 探究AI生成内容标签是否能有效降低虚假信息的风险，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过焦点小组定性探索用户对AI标签的看法，并进行预注册在线调查（1300+参与者）定量评估标签效果。

Result: 标签帮助识别AI生成虚假信息，但也导致用户过度依赖，且误标会提高人类虚假信息的可信度。

Conclusion: 标签虽有用但需谨慎设计，避免副作用。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans'
interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to
create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed
regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only
little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated
misinformation.
  Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we
study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling.
Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the
successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users'
opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we
conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants
to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize
misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus
groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical
implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying
AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security
benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might
over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated
images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief
in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated
image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images
conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of
labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了CaMeL框架的改进，针对其初始设计中的不足之处（如信任假设、侧信道问题等）提出了四项工程优化，以增强LLM代理的安全性。

Motivation: CaMeL框架虽能有效应对提示注入攻击，但其假设用户提示可信，且忽略了侧信道问题，同时在性能上也存在双LLM设计的权衡。论文旨在解决这些问题，提升CaMeL的威胁覆盖范围和可用性。

Method: 1. 提示输入筛查；2. 输出审计以检测指令泄漏；3. 分层风险访问模型平衡可用性与控制；4. 引入验证的中间语言提供形式化保证。

Result: 通过这些改进，CaMeL更符合企业级安全最佳实践，并支持可扩展部署。

Conclusion: 论文通过工程优化显著提升了CaMeL的安全性和实用性，使其更适合实际应用场景。

Abstract: CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning) introduces a capability-based
sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language model (LLM)
agents. While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits
side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM
design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering
improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We
introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to
detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability
and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees.
Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security
and support scalable deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM)的新方法，旨在在大型语言模型中实施组织数据访问控制机制，确保生成的响应符合权限要求。

Motivation: 企业在使用LLM时，数据访问控制可能因权限不一致而失效，因此需要一种方法在LLM中实施精细化的访问控制。

Method: 论文提出了PermLLM的三个新机制，基于参数高效微调（PEFT）实现访问控制，并引入了两种评估指标（DDI和UGI）来衡量访问控制效果。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验证明PermLLM机制有效，同时验证了DDI和UGI指标在量化LLM访问控制中的实用性。

Conclusion: PermLLM为组织提供了一种在LLM中实施数据访问控制的可行方案，并能通过引入的指标进行有效评估。

Abstract: In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and
carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access
control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed
data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate
access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs
that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query
responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to
determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query
responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can
be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We
also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate
the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM
mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired
access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access
advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership
Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility
evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through
extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP),
in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for
quantifying access control in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为BugWhisperer的新框架，采用经过专门微调的大语言模型（LLM）来自动化并提升系统级芯片（SoC）安全性验证的可扩展性和有效性。

Motivation: 由于现有的SoC安全性验证方法依赖手动操作、劳动密集且缺乏灵活性，难以有效检测注册传输级别（RTL）的漏洞，因此需要一种更高效、自适应的解决方案。

Method: 通过微调LLM增强其在硬件安全领域的知识，利用其文本推理和知识迁移能力，开发了一个开源LLM和配套的硬件漏洞数据库，以自动化验证流程。

Result: 实验证明，这种定制化的LLM显著提高了安全性验证的效率和灵活性，同时配套的漏洞数据库也为研究社区提供了支持。

Conclusion: BugWhisperer框架通过结合微调LLM和漏洞数据库，为SoC安全性验证提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces
challenges due to manual, labor-intensive, and inflexible methodologies. These
issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making
bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper
proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized,
fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing
the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text
inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the
adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an
open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security
vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM
effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security
verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware
vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the
research community in enhancing the security verification process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出AgentAlign框架，通过抽象行为链生成安全对齐数据，提升LLM代理的安全性，同时最小化对实用性的影响。

Motivation: LLM从知识提供者转变为行动执行者，能力边界扩大的同时，恶意使用风险显著增加。当前代理即使未被攻击也可能执行恶意任务，需解决训练后阶段的安全对齐问题。

Method: 利用抽象行为链作为安全对齐数据合成的媒介，通过在模拟环境中实例化行为链，生成真实可执行的指令，并平衡安全性与实用性。

Result: 在AgentHarm基准上，方法将开源模型的安全性提升了35.8%至79.5%，且几乎不影响或增强其实用性，优于多种提示方法。

Conclusion: AgentAlign有效解决了LLM代理的安全对齐问题，同时保持了实用性，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge
providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability
boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use.
Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous
malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic
use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we
propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains
as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these
behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our
framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable
instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further
ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions
through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating
the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on
AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models
using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5%
improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their
helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have
both been open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF) 是一种针对视觉与语言导航（VLN）代理的新型攻击框架，通过生成对抗性3D对象来研究其对VLM感知模块的影响。

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）在服务导向导航系统中的集成，系统在关键任务工作流中的漏洞变得不可忽视。现有的对抗攻击未能充分考虑服务计算环境下对可靠性和服务质量（QoS）的需求。

Method: AdvOF首先在2D和3D空间中精确聚合和对齐受害对象位置，定义并渲染对抗性对象。随后，通过多视图迭代融合和局部更新，对对抗性对象与受害对象之间的物理属性和VLM感知进行正则化优化。

Result: 广泛评估显示，AdvOF能在对抗条件下有效降低代理性能，同时对正常导航任务的干扰最小。

Conclusion: 这项工作提升了VLM驱动的导航系统中服务安全性的理解，为物理世界部署中的鲁棒服务组合提供了计算基础。

Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework
targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented
environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models
like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and
decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in
mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to
address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service
(QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of
adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In
particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object
positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects.
Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization
between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM
perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the
optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from
local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF
can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while
maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work
advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation
systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in
physical-world deployments.

Conclusion: 信息流控制和动态污点跟踪是提升AI代理安全的有效方法，Fides规划器在安全策略执行和任务多样性上表现优异。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous and capable, ensuring their
security against vulnerabilities such as prompt injection becomes critical.
This paper explores the use of information-flow control (IFC) to provide
security guarantees for AI agents. We present a formal model to reason about
the security and expressiveness of agent planners. Using this model, we
characterize the class of properties enforceable by dynamic taint-tracking and
construct a taxonomy of tasks to evaluate security and utility trade-offs of
planner designs. Informed by this exploration, we present Fides, a planner that
tracks confidentiality and integrity labels, deterministically enforces
security policies, and introduces novel primitives for selectively hiding
information. Its evaluation in AgentDojo demonstrates that this approach
broadens the range of tasks that can be securely accomplished. A tutorial to

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于密钥混沌动力学变换的安全且保护隐私的神经网络推理框架。该方法应用了一个由密码学种子生成的确定性混沌系统来处理张量，产生不可逆、用户特定的变换，从而实现认证推理、张量级水印和数据溯源。该框架提供了可扩展且轻量级的替代方案，为AI系统中的张量级安全开辟了新方向。

Motivation: 当前AI系统中缺乏有效的张量级安全解决方案，传统加密方法在计算开销和可扩展性方面存在局限。本文旨在通过混沌动力学变换提供一种轻量级且安全的替代方案，以满足认证推理和数据溯源的需求。

Method: 该方法使用了确定性且由密码学种子生成的混沌系统，将张量进行非可逆变换，确保变换结果具有用户特异性。具体功能包括认证推理、张量级水印嵌入和数据溯源。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在保持模型性能的同时，实现了安全且隐私保护的推理，并支持水印和溯源功能。与传统加密方法相比，其计算开销更低且更具可扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的混沌动力学变换框架为AI系统提供了一种高效、轻量且安全的张量级保护方案，未来可进一步优化其应用场景与性能。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel framework for secure and privacy-preserving
neural network inference based on keyed chaotic dynamical transformations. The
proposed method applies a deterministic, cryptographically seeded chaotic
system to tensors, producing non-invertible, user-specific transformations that
enable authenticated inference, tensor-level watermarking, and data
attribution. This framework offers a scalable and lightweight alternative to
conventional cryptographic techniques, and establishes a new direction for
tensor-level security in AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了基于贝叶斯视角的数据重建新观点，并定义了可防止重建攻击的安全框架，同时重新审视了指纹编码攻击（FPC）的本质。

Motivation: 探讨数据重建的安全性，澄清FPC攻击的真实性质，并挑战现有关于重建攻击不可能性的结论。

Method: 采用贝叶斯统计方法分析数据重建，定义新的安全框架以防范重建攻击，并理论验证其在特定场景下的有效性。

Result: 证明FPC实质上是成员推理攻击，而非重建攻击；在某些情况下，若目标仅为防止重建，则FPC的不可能性结论不成立。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯视角为数据重建安全提供了新思路，且区分重建与成员推理攻击对隐私保护有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce a new Bayesian perspective on the concept of data
reconstruction, and leverage this viewpoint to propose a new security
definition that, in certain settings, provably prevents reconstruction attacks.
We use our paradigm to shed new light on one of the most notorious attacks in
the privacy and memorization literature - fingerprinting code attacks (FPC). We
argue that these attacks are really a form of membership inference attacks,
rather than reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we show that if the goal is
solely to prevent reconstruction (but not membership inference), then in some
cases the impossibility results derived from FPC no longer apply.

TL;DR: TailorSQL利用历史查询工作负载中的信息来提升NL2SQL的自然语言转SQL的准确性和延迟，相比现有方法最高可提升2倍执行准确率。

Motivation: 现有NL2SQL技术通常仅依赖数据库模式和预训练大模型，忽略了实际环境中历史查询工作负载包含的有价值信息，如常见连接路径和模糊命名表列的语义。

Method: 引入TailorSQL系统，通过分析历史查询工作负载信息（如常见查询模式）优化SQL翻译过程。

Result: TailorSQL在标准基准测试中实现最高2倍的执行准确性提升。

Conclusion: 利用历史查询工作负载信息显著提升了NL2SQL的性能，验证了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into
SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users,
serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art
NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific
information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate
the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present
in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which
have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload
implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL
translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common
join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We
introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the
past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating
natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload,
TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on
standardized benchmarks.

TL;DR: KVzip是一种查询无关的KV缓存淘汰方法，通过压缩和重用KV缓存有效减少内存开销和注意力延迟，实验显示性能损失可忽略。

Motivation: 随着上下文长度的增加，KV缓存的内存开销和注意力延迟问题日益突出，需要一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: KVzip利用底层LLM量化KV对的重要性，通过重构原始上下文淘汰低重要性对，实现跨查询的缓存压缩和重用。

Result: 实验表明，KVzip将KV缓存大小减少了3-4倍，FlashAttention解码延迟降低约2倍，性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: KVzip在多种模型和任务中表现优异，显著优于现有查询感知的KV淘汰方法。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value
(KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand,
leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This
paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling
effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip
quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct
original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower
importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV
cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately
2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval,
reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models
such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching
up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV
eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache
budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.

Conclusion: StarBASE-GP通过结合进化搜索和生物理论，展示了在复杂性状遗传变异发现中的强大潜力。

Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool
- Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering
meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale
genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective
optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously
maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological
domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine
inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom
linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features,
and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative
candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of
Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass
index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a
biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto
fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both
ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets
for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant
biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework,
StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in
complex traits.

Conclusion: DFL在车联网中效果显著，但需增强对多域攻击的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message
classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous
behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data
collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale,
high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle
networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed
Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning
models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating
models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi)
Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification
accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data.
Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains
through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network.
We further show that local training data size and time-varying network
connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We
investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple
domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our
results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when
confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust
strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.

TL;DR: MF-TRPO算法，一种新颖的解决有限状态-动作空间下遍历平均场游戏近似纳什均衡的方案，通过扩展TRPO的稳定性和鲁棒性到平均场博弈框架，提供收敛性理论保证。

Motivation: 将强化学习中的TRPO方法引入平均场博弈领域，以解决复杂多智能体问题的优化挑战，填补理论研究与实践应用的空白。

Conclusion: MF-TRPO通过融合强化学习技术与平均场决策，为多智能体问题的解决提供了理论可靠的新途径，推动了MFG优化的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel
algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic
Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the
well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL)
setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its
stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in
the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing
theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact
formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive
high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances
MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making,
offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent
problems.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的框架，通过将大语言模型（LLMs）转化为多核布尔参数并直接在布尔域微调，显著降低了模型复杂度和信息损失。

Motivation: 现有二值化方法要么导致信息损失严重（后训练二值化），要么依赖高精度潜在权重增加复杂度（训练感知二值化）。论文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出一种新颖框架，将LLMs转化为多核布尔参数，并直接在布尔域进行微调，无需高精度潜在权重。

Result: 在多种LLMs上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的超低位量化和二值化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低复杂度的同时保持性能，为高效LLMs提供了新思路。

Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce
the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into
two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware
binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to
significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor
performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on
full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights,
which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs
into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them
directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent
weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and
inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of
LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit
quantization and binarization methods.

TL;DR: 传统分类器常假设特征独立或依赖简单关系，导致现实依赖场景中表现不佳。Deep Copula分类器（DCC）通过神经网络参数化copula分离特征边缘分布学习与联合依赖建模，适用于复杂依赖驱动的分类。

Motivation: 传统分类器忽略现实数据中的复杂依赖关系，DCC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DCC使用轻量级神经网络灵活捕捉特征间相互作用，并采用copula建模联合依赖结构。

Result: DCC在标准条件下收敛于贝叶斯最优分类器，且针对不同平滑度的copula密度提供了明确的收敛速率。

Conclusion: DCC通过结合统计严谨性与神经网络表示能力，为依赖感知分类提供了数学基础和可解释框架。

Abstract: Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly
simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where
real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC),
a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal
distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural
network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are
used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC
particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.
We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard
conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for
r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several
practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and
factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy
regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By
unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks,
DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for
dependency-aware classification.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: JAPAN提出了一种基于密度分数的共形预测框架，解决了传统残差方法在多模态分布下的保守性问题，通过归一化流模型生成紧凑且自适应的预测区域。

Motivation: 传统基于残差的共形预测方法在多模态分布下表现保守，预测区域往往无法准确反映复杂分布的真正形状，JAPAN旨在通过密度分数改进这一问题。

Method: JAPAN结合归一化流模型估计预测密度，通过阈值化密度分数生成紧凑且自适应的预测区域，保持有限样本覆盖保证。

Result: 实验表明，JAPAN在多变量回归和预测任务中校准良好，且预测区域比现有基线更紧凑。

Conclusion: JAPAN为共形预测提供了一种更灵活高效的框架，特别适用于复杂分布场景。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty
quantification with finite-sample validity guarantees, making it an attractive
tool for constructing reliable prediction sets. However, existing approaches
commonly rely on residual-based conformity scores, which impose geometric
constraints and struggle when the underlying distribution is multimodal. In
particular, they tend to produce overly conservative prediction areas centred
around the mean, often failing to capture the true shape of complex predictive
distributions. In this work, we introduce JAPAN (Joint Adaptive Prediction
Areas with Normalising-Flows), a conformal prediction framework that uses
density-based conformity scores. By leveraging flow-based models, JAPAN
estimates the (predictive) density and constructs prediction areas by
thresholding on the estimated density scores, enabling compact, potentially
disjoint, and context-adaptive regions that retain finite-sample coverage
guarantees. We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically
validate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating
good calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines.
We also provide several \emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed
framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稳定的Thompson采样变体，通过增加对数因子膨胀后验方差，解决了自适应采样带来的统计推断问题，同时仅以对数因子增加了遗憾。

Motivation: 传统Thompson采样虽在渐近最优性和实际效果上表现优异，但其自适应采样机制为模型参数的置信区间构建带来了挑战。

Method: 提出稳定Thompson采样（Stable Thompson Sampling），通过膨胀后验方差的方法，使得对臂均值的估计具有渐近正态性。

Result: 该变体在保持Thompson采样优越性的同时，使估计具有渐近正态性，遗憾仅以对数因子增加。

Conclusion: 通过以较小的遗憾代价，稳定Thompson采样为自适应决策算法提供了有效的统计推断方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected
via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known
to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive
sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for
model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable
Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic
factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates
of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this
statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases
regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal
a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid
statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms.

Motivation: 先前的研究对Goodhart定律的变体进行了分类或研究了代理度量优化的影响，但未考虑代理度量与目标的耦合关系。本文旨在放宽这些假设，以更全面地理解Goodhart定律的作用机制。

Method: 通过放宽独立性假设和学习范式假设，研究代理度量与目标之间的耦合关系，分析这种耦合对Goodhart效应的影响。

Result: 在轻尾目标和轻尾差异的情况下，依赖性不会改变Goodhart效应的本质；在轻尾目标和重尾差异的情况下，过度优化的速率与差异的重尾性成反比。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同分布条件下Goodhart效应的差异性，为理解代理度量优化的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a
measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning
models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical
evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however
being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's
law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a
proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we
alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and
the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the
effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on
Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and
light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's
effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we
exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely
proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and
the metric. %

Conclusion: 偏好反馈在特定条件下可显著提升参数估计效率，适用于高斯或拉普拉斯分布等场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference
feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions
under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of
continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes
pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative
preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that
preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than
sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences.
Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we
propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of
$\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$
rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that
matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants.
While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are
satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for
preferences based on the log-probability reward.

Conclusion: 论文结论

Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as
digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central
challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly
known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of
coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively
underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic
aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,
providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our
theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper
bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under
the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on
the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the
signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic
side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for
computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key
ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the
Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations,
significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging
strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We
demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 研究如何在给定样本下高效估计离散分布，尤其是关注KL散度最小化，并探索私有和非私有条件下的实例最优性。

Method: 通过构建极小极大最优私有估计器，发现其局限性后，转而研究实例最优性，提出基于Good-Turing估计器的变种算法，并分析局部邻域的上下界。

Result: 在局部邻域内，算法能够达到常数因子的实例最优性，且证明了比以往更精确的KL散度估计下界。

Conclusion: 论文通过实例最优性视角改进了分布估计的性能，尤其在私有和非私有条件下均表现优异。

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of estimating an unknown discrete
distribution $p$ over $d$ symbols, given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the
distribution. We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the
true distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax
optimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on
an algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and
simple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on
real distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality
viewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum
achievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under
natural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve
instance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential
privacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the
Good-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that
more precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL
divergence, compared to ones considered in prior works.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为Muon的优化器，专门用于优化矩阵结构的参数，其性能优于传统优化器，但其理论收敛行为和优势原因尚不明确。本文通过理论分析揭示了Muon在低秩和近似分块对角Hessian矩阵下的优势。

Motivation: 传统优化器将矩阵参数视为扁平向量，可能忽略其结构特性。Muon优化器虽在实践中表现优异，但缺乏理论支持。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过收敛速率分析，比较Muon与梯度下降（GD），并理论推导Muon在特定条件下的优势。

Result: 理论表明，Muon在低秩和近似分块对角Hessian矩阵下表现更优，实验也验证了这一点。

Conclusion: Muon在特定矩阵结构下具有理论优势，为神经网络训练提供了更高效的优化选择。

Abstract: The majority of parameters in neural networks are naturally represented as
matrices. However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters
as flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their
inherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been
proposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters.
Extensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform
traditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the
theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind
its superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a
comprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with
Gradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon
can outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from
the low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices
-- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our
experimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.

Method: 通过理论分析，论文识别了一系列条件，用于区分可解与不可解的问题。这些条件与损失函数的Lipschitz连续性无关，也不同于机器学习中传统的可学习性特征。

Result: 研究表明，损失函数的Lipschitz连续性并非无分布最小化的必要条件。同时，论文提出的可解性条件也与经典机器学习理论中的特征不同，为无假设统计问题提供了新的理论框架。

Conclusion: 本文通过理论分析，明确了无分布条件下单变量凸优化问题的可解性边界，为统计和机器学习领域的假设自由问题提供了新的理论依据。

Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are
solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has
long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a
(univariate) convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable
in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between
solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps
surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not
necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from
classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

Conclusion: 平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器在稀疏测量下具有鲁棒性，适用于图的信号恢复和多层排序问题。

Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each
vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given
partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of
the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are
smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over
the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error
for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares
estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this
estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially
very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a
vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a
``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths
of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are
obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency
is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are
very sparse and disconnected.

Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing
approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent
limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted
capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific
biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging
instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based
framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The
proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that
extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric
principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks
with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network
classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic
accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a
broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information,
enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks.
Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative
conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain
network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in
the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers
with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more
accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic
monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于自由能原理的吸引子网络理论，解释了如何从随机动力系统中自然生成自组织动力学，无需显式规则，并优化了贝叶斯推理与学习过程。

Motivation: 理解自组织动力学如何从第一性原理中涌现，对神经元计算和人工智能设计至关重要。

Method: 通过自由能原理形式化随机动力系统的普遍划分，推导出吸引子网络的涌现特性，结合分析和模拟验证正交化吸引子表示的优势。

Result: 网络在自由能景观中编码先验信念，优化预测准确性与模型复杂度，并展示对称/稀疏（随机数据）或非对称耦合（时序数据）的动态特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自组织吸引子网络提供了统一理论框架，对AI与神经科学具有启发性。

Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the
brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first
principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations
and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how
attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal
partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for
explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but
efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such
self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian
active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior
beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning
fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via
simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately
orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously
optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors
efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual
information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while
random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential
data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics,
offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings
offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel
insights for AI and neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文从理论和实践角度重新定义了大语言模型（LLMs），将其视为集体人类知识（CK）的动态体现，认为智能通过对话激发而非静态存储。作者结合神经科学与AI概念，基于与ChatGPT-4的持续互动，探讨了对话模式、微调的影响及人机协同增强的概念。

Motivation: 探索LLMs作为集体人类知识动态体现的新视角，理解对话如何激发智能，以及人机协同的潜力。

Method: 结合神经科学与AI理论，通过持续与ChatGPT-4互动分析对话模式、微调效果及协同增强现象。

Result: 提出了一种新框架，将LLMs视为动态知识体现，揭示了对话在智能激发中的作用及人机协同的互惠效应。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解当代AI系统中的交互、表征与代理问题提供了新视角，强调了动态对话的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically analysed through architectural,
behavioural, or training-data lenses. This article offers a theoretical and
experiential re-framing: LLMs as dynamic instantiations of Collective human
Knowledge (CK), where intelligence is evoked through dialogue rather than
stored statically. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience and AI, and grounded
in sustained interaction with ChatGPT-4, I examine emergent dialogue patterns,
the implications of fine-tuning, and the notion of co-augmentation: mutual
enhancement between human and machine cognition. This perspective offers a new
lens for understanding interaction, representation, and agency in contemporary
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文探讨了传统浏览器在处理大量跨页面信息时的不足，提出通过AI增强用户与网页内容的交互，减少认知和手动操作负担，介绍了原型浏览器Orca及其用户驱动的信息探索、组织和合成方法。

Motivation: 传统浏览器在多标签页环境下难以高效支持跨页面的信息操作与合成，而现有AI系统虽能自动化浏览但削弱了用户控制与上下文理解。因此，研究旨在探索AI如何辅助用户更高效地交互与整合网页内容。

Method: 通过文献研究信息任务与网页浏览挑战，结合迭代设计流程，开发了原型浏览器Orca。Orca利用AI将网页视为可塑材料，支持用户与AI协作操作和合成内容，构建动态的浏览器级工作空间。

Result: 评估显示，Orca提升了用户的信息采集意愿，增强了控制力，并在更广泛的信息环境中提升了感知灵活性。

Conclusion: AI增强的交互设计（如Orca）可有效支持用户规模化操作网页内容，同时保持用户主导权与上下文理解。

Abstract: Web-based activities are fundamentally distributed across webpages. However,
conventional browsers with stacks of tabs fail to support operating and
synthesizing large volumes of information across pages. While recent AI systems
enable fully automated web browsing and information synthesis, they often
diminish user agency and hinder contextual understanding. Therefore, we explore
how AI could instead augment users' interactions with content across webpages
and mitigate cognitive and manual efforts. Through literature on information
tasks and web browsing challenges, and an iterative design process, we present
a rich set of novel interactions with our prototype web browser, Orca.
Leveraging AI, Orca supports user-driven exploration, operation, organization,
and synthesis of web content at scale. To enable browsing at scale, webpages
are treated as malleable materials that humans and AI can collaboratively
manipulate and compose into a malleable, dynamic, and browser-level workspace.
Our evaluation revealed an increased "appetite" for information foraging,
enhanced user control, and more flexibility in sensemaking across a broader
information landscape on the web.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型交互技术Human-in-the-loop Decoding（HiLDe），旨在让用户在代码生成过程中观察并直接影响LLM的决策，以减少漏洞生成并更好地满足用户需求。

Motivation: AI编程工具虽然能显著提升程序员能力，但可能导致用户过度依赖系统、停止思考，这在软件安全等关键领域可能带来严重后果。

Method: 研究者开发了HiLDe，一种代码补全助手，通过高亮显示LLM的关键决策并提供本地替代选项，让用户干预决策。

Result: 在安全性相关任务的研究（N=18）中，HiLDe显著减少了用户生成的漏洞，并使其代码更符合目标。

Conclusion: HiLDe通过人机协作提升了代码生成的可靠性和用户控制力。

Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers'
capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users
from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off
their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These
behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software
security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique
that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code
generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal
requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant
that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local
alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on
security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate
significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their
goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文首次将大语言模型（LLMs）应用于多模态抑郁症检测，结合音频特征和心理知识，显著提升了诊断准确性。

Motivation: 抑郁症检测的现有深度神经网络（DNNs）在现实世界中效果有限，且大语言模型（LLMs）在处理非文本线索时表现不佳，亟需结合多模态数据和心理学知识改进。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ数据集，通过Wav2Vec提取音频特征并将其映射到基于文本的LLMs，并提出一种新策略——利用问答集向LLMs注入心理学知识。

Result: 与基准分数相比，该方法在平均绝对误差（MAE）和均方根误差（RMSE）上均取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合多模态数据和心理学知识的大语言模型在抑郁症检测中具有更高准确性，为后续研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse
and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for
recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models
(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and
struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through
vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone
is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating
psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression
detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the
pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further
processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological
knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a
question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach
yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original
paper. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 传统方法在评估特殊教育学生抑郁情况时存在不足，本文提出结合人类共情与AI的HEAE框架，通过整合教师共情向量提升评估准确率至82.74%。

Motivation: 现有评估方法在敏感环境中难以准确反映学生真实抑郁状态，且缺乏教师共情洞察的整合，因此提出HEAE框架弥合这一鸿沟。

Method: 提出HEAE框架，结合学生叙述文本与教师衍生的9维“共情向量”（基于PHQ-9框架），通过多模态融合与分类架构优化实现抑郁严重程度分类。

Result: 实验表明，HEAE在7级抑郁严重程度分类中达到82.74%的准确率，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: HEAE通过结构化嵌入人类共情，为情感计算提供了更负责任、伦理的路径，强调人机协作而非替代。

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education
is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students'
true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student
narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from
teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to
address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To
address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration,
this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered
AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity
assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a
teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by
the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a
structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous
experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and
classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity
classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and
ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为exLong的框架，用于自动生成异常行为测试（EBTs），弥补开发者通常更关注‘happy paths’测试的不足。

Motivation: 开发者在测试中往往忽视异常行为测试，导致代码对异常事件的处理不足。

Method: exLong利用基于CodeLlama微调的大型语言模型，分析异常抛出路径、守卫条件以及类似路径的非异常测试。

Result: 能有效帮助开发者生成全面的异常行为测试。

Conclusion: exLong是解决异常行为测试不足的有效工具。

Abstract: Exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) are crucial in software development for
verifying that code correctly handles unwanted events and throws appropriate
exceptions. However, prior research has shown that developers often prioritize
testing "happy paths", e.g., paths without unwanted events over exceptional
scenarios. We present exLong, a framework that automatically generates EBTs to
address this gap. exLong leverages a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from
CodeLlama and incorporates reasoning about exception-throwing traces,
conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional
behavior tests that execute similar traces. Our demonstration video illustrates
how exLong can effectively assist developers in creating comprehensive EBTs for
their project (available at https://youtu.be/Jro8kMgplZk).

Motivation: 传统开源软件（OSS）可用性评估方法依赖人工，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 使用基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能代理模拟不同经验水平的开发者执行编程任务，动态构建特定平台知识库以生成代码，并自动评估其合规性、正确性和可读性。

Result: 在图形分析平台上的应用证明了OSS-UAgent在自动化可用性评估中的有效性。

Conclusion: OSS-UAgent提供了一种高效、可扩展的OSS可用性评估方法。

Abstract: Usability evaluation is critical to the impact and adoption of open source
software (OSS), yet traditional methods relying on human evaluators suffer from
high costs and limited scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce
OSS-UAgent, an automated, configurable, and interactive agent-based usability
evaluation framework specifically designed for open source software. Our
framework employs intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) to
simulate developers performing programming tasks across various experience
levels (from Junior to Expert). By dynamically constructing platform-specific
knowledge bases, OSS-UAgent ensures accurate and context-aware code generation.
The generated code is automatically evaluated across multiple dimensions,
including compliance, correctness, and readability, providing a comprehensive
measure of the software's usability. Additionally, our demonstration showcases
OSS-UAgent's practical application in evaluating graph analytics platforms,
highlighting its effectiveness in automating usability evaluation.

TL;DR: SWE-bench-Live是一个动态更新的基准测试，解决了SWE-bench的限制，提供可扩展和自动化的实例构建，用于评估LLM在真实软件问题上的表现。

Motivation: 现有基准测试（如SWE-bench）存在更新滞后、覆盖范围窄和依赖人工的问题，阻碍了扩展性并导致过拟合风险。

Method: 提出SWE-bench-Live，通过自动化流水线从GitHub实时获取问题并生成Docker环境，实现可扩展和持续更新。

Result: 在SWE-bench-Live上测试的先进LLM框架与静态基准相比表现显著差距，且分析了不同任务维度的性能差异。

Conclusion: SWE-bench-Live为动态软件环境提供了多样、可执行的评估工具，支持LLM在真实开发场景中的严格测试。

Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world
bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become
standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been
updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and
depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment
setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and
data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a
\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our
initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created
since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated
Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is
\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process
from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and
enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a
substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even
under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy,
we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task
difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in
live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous,
contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world
software development settings.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了研究软件的重要性及其元数据的整合问题，通过评估指令调优的大语言模型来解决软件元数据身份解析任务，为生命科学研究软件的FAIRness提供参考。

Motivation: 研究软件在科研中的重要性日益凸显，但其元数据的质量和完整性差异较大，需要整合以支持软件的可持续发展。

Method: 利用指令调优的大语言模型进行软件元数据身份解析，并基于人工注释的黄金标准对模型进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 自动化语义判断在FAIR对齐的软件元数据中仍面临挑战，未来需进一步改进模型和方法。

Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has
been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has
been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of
software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy
ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences.
Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this
metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices.
However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse
documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability,
consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to
address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language
models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step
in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is
the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform
that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the
Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard,
examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based
proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high
precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations
of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in
FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.

Motivation: 开发高性能软件复杂且需专业知识，目前缺乏有效工具评估语言模型在此领域的实际能力。GSO基准旨在填补这一空白，推动相关研究。

Method: 建立自动化流程，从代码库提交历史中识别102个优化任务，并提供性能测试作为规范。代理需改进运行效率，并以专家优化为基准评估表现。

Result: 定量评估显示主流SWE代理成功率极低（<5%），推理时间扩展效果有限。定性分析揭露了低级语言处理、懒惰优化策略和瓶颈定位困难等关键失败模式。

Conclusion: 当前语言模型在高性能软件开发中能力不足，GSO基准的发布旨在支持未来研究。

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires
specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language
models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an
automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze
repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks
across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An
agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise
specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured
against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success
rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our
qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with
low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in
accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our
benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的代码虽然功能正确，但在效率上往往不足，影响了实际应用。本研究旨在通过反馈循环优化代码效率。

Method: 采用三种训练策略：监督微调（SFT）、直接偏好优化（DPO）和组相对策略优化（GRPO）。GRPO结合强化学习与执行反馈，持续优化代码性能。

Result: 实验数据表明，GRPO显著提高了代码通过率（47%到62%）和效率超越人类提交的概率（31%到45%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，强化学习能有效帮助LLMs在测试时自我优化代码效率，GRPO表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but
often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world
deployment. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative
optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where
LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an
execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy
Optimization~(GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark
show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO,
using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously
optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to
62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from
31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency
improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly
self-improve code efficiency.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance is the practice of establishing
frameworks, policies, and procedures to ensure the responsible, ethical, and
safe development and deployment of AI systems. Although AI governance is a core
pillar of Responsible AI, current literature still lacks synthesis across such
governance frameworks and practices. Objective: To identify which frameworks,
principles, mechanisms, and stakeholder roles are emphasized in secondary
literature on AI governance. Method: We conducted a rapid tertiary review of
nine peer-reviewed secondary studies from IEEE and ACM (20202024), using
structured inclusion criteria and thematic semantic synthesis. Results: The
most cited frameworks include the EU AI Act and NIST RMF; transparency and
accountability are the most common principles. Few reviews detail actionable
governance mechanisms or stakeholder strategies. Conclusion: The review
consolidates key directions in AI governance and highlights gaps in empirical
validation and inclusivity. Findings inform both academic inquiry and practical
adoption in organizations.

TL;DR: CTIM-Rover是基于AutoCodeRover的AI代理，通过引入跨任务实例记忆（CTIM）扩展了代理推理框架，但未能在软件工程问题中超越AutoCodeRover。

Motivation: 现有开源SE代理在单个任务实例后丢弃长期记忆，而CTIM旨在利用跨任务记忆提升问题修复能力。

Method: 该方法结合体验学习（EL）和混合专家（MoEs）思想，构建通用和仓库级CTIM。

Result: CTIM-Rover在测试中未超越AutoCodeRover，性能下降可能与噪声干扰或轨迹示例相关。

Conclusion: ExpeL和DoT-Bank未能扩展到实际SE问题，CTIM-Rover表现不及预期。

Abstract: We introduce CTIM-Rover, an AI agent for Software Engineering (SE) built on
top of AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024) that extends agentic reasoning
frameworks with an episodic memory, more specifically, a general and
repository-level Cross-Task-Instance Memory (CTIM). While existing open-source
SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al.,
2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning
frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task
instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all
locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is
particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the
Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a
Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose
and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform
AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor
DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis
indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories
as the likely source of the performance degradation.

Abstract: Predicting protein complex structures is essential for protein function
analysis, protein design, and drug discovery. While AI methods like AlphaFold
can predict accurate structural models for many protein complexes, reliably
estimating the quality of these predicted models (estimation of model accuracy,
or EMA) for model ranking and selection remains a major challenge. A key
barrier to developing effective machine learning-based EMA methods is the lack
of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for training and evaluation. To
address this gap, we introduce PSBench, a benchmark suite comprising four
large-scale, labeled datasets generated during the 15th and 16th community-wide
Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15 and CASP16).
PSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of
protein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and
modeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary
quality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also
provides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate
rigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and
evaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE
was blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing
EMA methods. These results highlight PSBench as a valuable resource for
advancing EMA research in protein complex modeling. PSBench is publicly
available at: https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PSBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于原子基础模型（AFM）的蛋白质局部环境表示方法，能有效捕获结构及化学特征，并应用于生物分子NMR光谱中的化学位移预测，取得了最优效果。

Motivation: 蛋白质的局部结构对其功能及与其他分子的相互作用至关重要，但现有方法难以全面建模其复杂多样的结构及化学特征，因此需要一种更有效的表示方法。

Method: 利用原子基础模型（AFM）的中间特征，构建了一种新颖的蛋白质局部环境表示，并结合物理知识开发了化学位移预测工具。

Result: 该表示法能准确捕捉局部结构（如二级结构基序）和化学特征（如氨基酸身份和质子化状态），并在化学位移预测中达到最优精度。

Conclusion: 原子基础模型及其表示方法为蛋白质建模提供了新思路，未来可进一步探索其在功能表示中的应用。

Abstract: The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and
interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative
representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and
designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments'
extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model,
and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a
novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the
intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate
that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary
motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation
state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits
meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the
distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of
biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations
enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising
effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations
for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this
will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional
representations for protein environments.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了带有前馈神经网络的Lur'e型非线性系统的局部稳定性，提出了两种估算吸引域的方法，并在数值结果中展示了优于现有方法的性能。

Motivation: 研究带有静态非线性反馈的前馈神经网络（FFNNs）的Lur'e型非线性系统的局部稳定性，旨在提供更优的吸引域估算方法。

Method: 提出了两种方法：(i) 基于Lyapunov的非保守方法，通过LMI构造二次函数的不变子集；(ii) 通过逐层传播线性松弛的新技术计算FFNNs的局部扇区边界。

Result: 数值结果显示，在吸引域大小和可扩展性方面均显著优于现有的积分二次约束方法。

Conclusion: 通过局部化的Aizerman框架和两种新方法，成功认证了局部指数稳定性，并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with
static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By
leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the
Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential
stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we
develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i)
a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel
sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and
(ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via
layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into
the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability.
Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral
quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.

Result: ICNN模型在预测电池退化方面表现出高准确性，并通过用户偏好展示了V2G收益与电池损耗之间的权衡曲线。

Conclusion: 该方法在平衡V2G收益和电池健康方面具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology
based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G
revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and
generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural
networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on
extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture
nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining
convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property
ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally
efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model
into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart
charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off
between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation,
controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery
health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in
predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off
curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery
health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging
strategies under realistic scenarios.

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用Siamese架构增强深度学习模型在高频交易中预测股价表现的方法，通过分离处理买卖数据并引入多头注意力机制，实验表明其在多数情况下能提升基线模型性能。

Motivation: 高频交易中，限价订单簿（LOB）数据的复杂性和高波动性使得股价预测具有挑战性，现有深度学习模型难以有效捕捉价格模式。作者观察到LOB数据中买卖两侧的对称性和价差的稳定性，以此为基础提出改进方案。

Method: 采用Siamese架构并行处理买卖数据，共享参数模块以捕捉对称性；结合多头注意力（MHA）与LSTM模块分析价格变动。实验使用中国A股市场14只军工股票数据，对比原始数据与常用订单流不平衡（OFI）特征输入的效果。

Result: Siamese方法在75%以上的案例中提升基线模型表现（除性能较差的MLP外），且MHA在短预测周期内尤其有效。

Conclusion: 对称性处理和注意力机制的引入能显著提升高频交易场景下的股价预测性能。

Abstract: In high-frequency trading (HFT), leveraging limit order books (LOB) to model
stock price movements is crucial for achieving profitable outcomes. However,
this task is challenging due to the high-dimensional and volatile nature of the
original data. Even recent deep learning models often struggle to capture price
movement patterns effectively, particularly without well-designed features. We
observed that raw LOB data exhibits inherent symmetry between the ask and bid
sides, and the bid-ask differences demonstrate greater stability and lower
complexity compared to the original data. Building on this insight, we propose
a novel approach in which leverages the Siamese architecture to enhance the
performance of existing deep learning models. The core idea involves processing
the ask and bid sides separately using the same module with shared parameters.
We applied our Siamese-based methods to several widely used strong baselines
and validated their effectiveness using data from 14 military industry stocks
in the Chinese A-share market. Furthermore, we integrated multi-head attention
(MHA) mechanisms with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to investigate
its role in modeling stock price movements. Our experiments used raw data and
widely used Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) features as input with some strong
baseline models. The results show that our method improves the performance of
strong baselines in over 75$% of cases, excluding the Multi-Layer Perception
(MLP) baseline, which performed poorly and is not considered practical.
Furthermore, we found that Multi-Head Attention can enhance model performance,
particularly over shorter forecasting horizons.

Conclusion: 未来AI设计需更深入考虑人类交际实践，当前LLM架构可能需改进以更好地对齐。

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational
agents based on large language models raises important questions about the
relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and
performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be
conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for
handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating
developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and
linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of
desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational
alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current
large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may
impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense
semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot
equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often
struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view
angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we
propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the
task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation.
We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel
Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This
enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without
unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to
ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive
Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while
ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic
target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM
algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our
approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and
complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner
achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a
specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further
confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object
mapping of unstructured environments.

Conclusion: VLM-RRT通过结合VLM和RRT的优势，在高复杂度环境中实现了更高效、更高质量的路径规划。

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental capability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), enabling them to efficiently navigate toward a target region
or explore complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Traditional
pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven
effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search
space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that
are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster
response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these
limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language
Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths
of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on
environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely
to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path
quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various
state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.

Conclusion: 认知护栏的引入为LLM在无人机群任务中的应用提供了安全和可靠的框架。

Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these
settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and
autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often
struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer
their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large
language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications.
While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations
and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure
safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must
be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design,
simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in
search-and-rescue missions.

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured
environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD)
with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the
nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model
to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the
remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing
which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel
inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance
gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion
model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time
that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining
or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation
models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically
meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb
control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in
dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged
mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise
coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified
reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills
involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and
striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes
real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between
simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors.
Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement
learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification
techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a
variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock
trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise
strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged
mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DeepMultiConnectome 是一种深度学习模型，可直接从纤维束成像预测结构连接组，无需灰质分区，支持多种分区方案，速度快且结果与传统方法高度相关。

Motivation: 传统连接组生成方法耗时且依赖灰质分区，难以适用于大规模研究，因此需要一种更高效且灵活的方法。

Method: 使用基于点云的神经网络和多任务学习，模型根据流线连接的区域进行分类，同时支持两种分区方案。

Result: 模型在 40 秒内预测全脑连接组，与传统方法结果高度相关（r > 0.98），且保持了网络特性和可重复性。

Conclusion: DeepMultiConnectome 提供一个高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于生成多种分区方案下的个性化连接组。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural
connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and
requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies.
We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts
structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray
matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a
point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies
streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation
schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate
DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young
Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter
parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural
connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in
approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing
predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the
conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation.
The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated
connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region
scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of
DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally
generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to
traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function.
Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating
subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.
We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN
upon publication.

Conclusion: 多模态AI系统通过结合CNN和LLM的优势，有望变革临床医学诊断，但其实际应用需进一步优化模型效率和可持续性。

Abstract: This study presents a multimodal AI framework designed for precisely
classifying medical diagnostic images. Utilizing publicly available datasets,
the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative
analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution
efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy,
F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated
$CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can
outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and
contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead
to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and
scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.

TL;DR: PCA预处理应用于超声图像分割，通过降噪和保留关键特征提升模型在外部数据集上的表现。

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中模型在未见数据集上表现不佳的问题，尤其是在小规模和多样性强的超声图像领域。

Method: 采用PCA预处理，保留90%数据集方差，生成降维后的数据集，并用U-Net模型进行训练和测试。

Result: PCA重建数据集显著提升了召回率和Dice分数，尤其在最差的基线性能案例中，召回率提升33%。

Conclusion: PCA重建可作为提升医学图像分割外部有效性的有效手段。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical
obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly
pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain
adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in
the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper
presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address
this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential
features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate
our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising
3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each
dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and
U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets.
Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five
out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on
a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our
experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of
original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for
model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving
statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05,
$p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p =
0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external
validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA
reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance,
especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external
validity in real-world medical applications.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在概率测度空间上最小化非凸函数，并通过KL散度正则化的问题，重点分析了最佳响应流的收敛性及其在非凸非凹极小极大问题中的应用。

Motivation: 研究动机是解决非凸函数正则化优化问题，尤其是在KL散度正则化下，如何通过最佳响应流确保全局最小化解的存在性和唯一性。

Method: 利用最佳响应流（模拟博弈流），分析其收敛性与非凸性程度、正则化参数及参考测度尾部行为的关系。提出了选择正则化器的具体方法，确保最佳响应算子在L1-Wasserstein距离下是收缩的。

Result: 证明了通过选择合适的正则化器，最佳响应流能够确保存在唯一不动点，该点即为全局最小化解。这一结果扩展了凸优化问题的现有研究。

Conclusion: 研究为非凸优化问题提供了一种有效方法，特别是在强化学习中的策略优化应用，为马尔可夫决策过程和博弈提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of
probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with
respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of
solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize
the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play
flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the
degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the
regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In
particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex
functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with
respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of
its unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer
for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best
Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by
the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with
arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely
how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a
specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these
results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy
optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax
parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper improves the theoretical understanding of the shuffling gradient method, specifically for nonsmooth convex functions, showing that Random Reshuffle (RR) and Single Shuffle (SS) outperform Proximal Gradient Descent (GD).

Motivation: Despite the practical effectiveness of the shuffling gradient method, its theoretical convergence properties, especially for nonsmooth functions, remain limited. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The study focuses on analyzing the last-iterate convergence of RR and SS strategies, comparing them with Proximal GD in nonsmooth convex settings.

Result: The paper demonstrates that RR and SS achieve faster convergence rates than Proximal GD for nonsmooth convex functions and provides near-optimal convergence results for RR's suffix average.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the benefits of randomness in shuffling strategies and advance the theoretical foundation of gradient methods in nonsmooth optimization.

Abstract: We study the convergence of the shuffling gradient method, a popular
algorithm employed to minimize the finite-sum function with regularization, in
which functions are passed to apply (Proximal) Gradient Descent (GD) one by one
whose order is determined by a permutation on the indices of functions. In
contrast to its easy implementation and effective performance in practice, the
theoretical understanding remains limited. A recent advance by (Liu & Zhou,
2024b) establishes the first last-iterate convergence results under various
settings, especially proving the optimal rates for smooth (strongly) convex
optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions
are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved
last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used
Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies
are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of
randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal
convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling
scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et
al., 2022).

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在线缩放梯度方法(OSGM)的理论框架，通过在线学习自适应调整步长，从而加速一阶优化方法的收敛速度。OSGM在光滑凸问题上实现了全局收敛、改进的强凸问题复杂度以及局部超线性收敛。

Motivation: 研究的动机在于通过在线学习机制自适应调整优化算法的步长，以获得比固定步长更优的收敛性能，并解释超梯度下降启发式方法在机器学习优化中的成功经验。

Method: OSGM通过反馈函数量化步长的有效性，并利用在线学习算法调整步长。该方法确保了步长不会比最优步长差，并在光滑凸、强凸以及局部超线性收敛问题上表现出色。

Result: OSGM在光滑凸问题上实现了轨迹依赖的全局收敛，在光滑强凸问题上改进了复杂度结果，并实现了局部超线性收敛。该方法还能生成具有非渐进超线性收敛的一阶方法。

Conclusion: OSGM是一种新型的一阶优化方法，其自适应步长的设计不仅理论优越，还能解释现有启发式方法在实践中的有效性。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled
gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt
stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the
effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence
measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning
algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that
are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable
convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1)
trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an
improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local
superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order
methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated
quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the
popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.

Method: 提出SLIT框架，利用基于机器学习的元启发式方法，在分布式云数据中心中协同优化LLM的服务质量（如首词响应时间）、碳排放、水资源消耗和能源成本。

Result: SLIT框架能显著降低LLM推理阶段的碳足迹、水消耗和能源开销，同时保持服务质量。

Conclusion: SLIT为LLM的可持续部署提供了可行方案，随着LLM普及，此类框架将愈发重要。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, and
Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs
continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training
overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user
requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies
estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed
training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative
carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the
footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of
fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To
address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel
framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first
token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes
a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of
LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will
become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.

Abstract: Community partitioning is crucial in network analysis, with modularity
optimization being the prevailing technique. However, traditional
modularity-based methods often overlook fairness, a critical aspect in
real-world applications. To address this, we introduce protected group networks
and propose a novel fairness-modularity metric. This metric extends traditional
modularity by explicitly incorporating fairness, and we prove that minimizing
it yields naturally fair partitions for protected groups while maintaining
theoretical soundness. We develop a general optimization framework for fairness
partitioning and design the efficient Fair Fast Newman (FairFN) algorithm,
enhancing the Fast Newman (FN) method to optimize both modularity and fairness.
Experiments show FairFN achieves significantly improved fairness and
high-quality partitions compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on
unbalanced datasets.
