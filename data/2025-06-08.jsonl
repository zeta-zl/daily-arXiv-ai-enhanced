Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process.

In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework\nthat uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what\nnot to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong\ncoding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into\nstructured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and\navoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions\naccurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to\npoint cloud representations with traditional search algorithms.

Implementation details, especially in Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and\nreproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight\nbenchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and\nevaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of\nboth single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality\nsingle-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such\nas the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence\ndiversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that\nfacilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT\nperformance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,\nincluding Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and\nLagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a\ncomprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red\nteaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features\nfor RFT-based red teaming.

We achieve this by automatically optimizing\nloss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard\ngradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular\nparameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization\nscheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,\nwhich models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring\nboundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in\njointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one\nshot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across\nstate-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D\nestimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently\noutperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space\ntransformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural\nsimilarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual\ndifficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful\nreconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and\nperceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed\nacyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths\ncorrespond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in\nthe real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize\nthe task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements\nlike safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully\nanalyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In\nthis work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible\nagent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also\nknown as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition\nwhere the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a\nnear-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a\nunion bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the\napproximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical\nloss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video\ngame-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with\nreinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in\napproximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition."}

To asses it, we evaluated ten\nbase models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail\ndatasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under\nvarying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve\nforecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these\ngains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,\naccuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency\nsignificantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for\npoint forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,\nachieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to\naccuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or\nthree models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results.

This study presents two\nsignificant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB\ncamera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of\nemploying visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise\ntimestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high\nfrequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the\nphysical properties of the rolling-shutter camera.

For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use\nderived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's\nstronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard\nCLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for\nvarious downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for\ndifferent open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the\nsame trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving\nscaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.\nAccurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and\ndataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on\nmeasurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic\ncomparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their\ncreation.

In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model\nmiscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model\ngenerations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using\ncontrolled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which\npreference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this\npreference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high\nmiscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences.

Unlike\nin conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is\nreinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular\ndata points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and\nreliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,\n(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the\ninfluence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small\nnumber of training steps.

And yet despite\nthe wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs\nbeyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep\nencoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse\nregularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable\nof producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work\nwe formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as\nanalogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model\nthat circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we\nprove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of\nstructured data spread across a union of manifolds.

Here, we\npresent and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from\nLLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its\nown ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of\nintrospection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its\nown temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately\nconsidered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)\nnot accompanied by conscious experience."}

In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in\naddition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate\nour agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both\nhuman participants, as well as our asynchronous agent.

Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology\nreports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE\ncomputed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of\nLLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels\nfrom CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)\nin high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =\n{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}).

Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative\nsolution to address these challenges.

We propose a new formulation of\nLLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced\nvia a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output\ndistribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is\npreserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to\nentropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and\nmaintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust\noptimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual\nalgorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through\nthe dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks\nacross diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently\nmatches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted\ninformation while preserving downstream utility."}

Under review", "summary": "Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and\nneurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer\ninterfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional\nmethods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight\nbut often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent\nTransformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong\ngeneralization performance, but typically have much larger computational\nrequirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time\nsettings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications."}

We\nprovide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification\nproblem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts\njudiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find\nthat, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple\nadaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely\nrandomized trials.

However,\nanalyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in\nscale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,\nfact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a\ncrowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired\nmulti-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans\ndiverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around\n12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are\ninfluenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not\ndirectly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and\nactual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,\nrevealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static\nencyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess\nperformance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by\ntesting search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and\nconventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does\nnot degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,\nthe quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on\nthe model's parametric knowledge.

However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus\non reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been\ncompromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously\nreinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to\noverlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment\ndata. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails\nthrough the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment\ndatasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that\nhigh similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,\nmaking models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity\nbetween these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and\nthus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance\nof upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and\nreducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer\nactionable insights for fine-tuning service providers."}
