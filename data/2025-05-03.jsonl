We construct Rosetta-PL by\ntranslating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical\nlanguage, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o).

If the mind is\na digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either\nover meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols.

If the mind is\ncomputing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are\navailable prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could\ntake place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes.

In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning\nframework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve\nNMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for\ncategorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments,\nallowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes\nand recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the\ndata, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction\nperformance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides\nclinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential\nfeatures contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves\naccuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical\nmethods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through\nfeature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new\nimportant factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and\nhospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction\nmodels."}

While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can\nsuggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic\ndescriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder\neffective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class\nimbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature\nMapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local\nMulti-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature\nextraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor\nprediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we\nintegrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically\nlearns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's\ncapability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy\nFeature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the\nmolecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global\ninformation and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To\nfurther mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed\nLoss (CIL).

Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes\nmessages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is\ncrucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets\nstate-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such\nmethods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known\ntriggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the\nprocess of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.\nThrough a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that\nfine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task\ntype exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data\naugmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to\niterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose\nreinforcing \\emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting\ntoken-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating\nposition IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on\nsuperficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our\nwork illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role\nbehavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers."}

Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data.

Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%\nzero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:\np=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization\nconsistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with\npathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native\nlisteners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners\n(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization\n(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,\nhuman perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical\nutility metrics.

Motion prediction is driven by an\nenergy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step\npredictions in a single operation.

Specifically, our model employs a\ngraph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that\ncaptures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational\nefficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the\ndenoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and\nadversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that\ndrive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally\nrealistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module\nbased on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical\nplausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes\ndataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness\nand generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a\nhigh level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic\nsafety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation\nof autonomous driving systems."}

These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nHowever, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,\nand can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these\ndifferences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\nconstructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,\nto create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge).
