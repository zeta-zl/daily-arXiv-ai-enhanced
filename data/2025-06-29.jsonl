Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after\nexecution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more\nthan expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,\neffectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human\nideas observed at the ideation stage.

To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning. To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw\ninspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by\ngeneral knowledge and intended goals. We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that\nincorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal\nreasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G^2-Reasoner significantly\nenhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and\ncounterfactual contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to\nadvance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making\nstrides towards level-2."}

In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits.

In conventional dense LLMs, all model weights are\nfetched each iteration, so speculation adds no latency overhead. Emerging\nMixture of Experts (MoE) models activate only a subset of weights per token,\ngreatly reducing data movement. However, we show that speculation is\nineffective for MoEs: draft tokens collectively activate more weights,\nincreasing data movement and verification time by 2-3x. When token throughput\ngains fail to offset this overhead, speculation causes slowdowns up to 1.5x,\nmaking it infeasible. Even when useful, the optimal K varies by task, model,\nand even between requests and iterations. Thus, despite widespread use in dense\nLLMs, speculation remains impractical in leading MoEs.\n  We present Cascade, a utility-driven framework that selectively enables\nspeculation to avoid slowdowns and dynamically tunes K to accelerate MoE\nserving. Cascade uses a lightweight metric, speculation utility, the ratio of\ntoken gains to verification cost, which shows iteration-level locality,\nenabling periodic decisions via short test and longer set phases. For each\nrequest, Cascade disables speculation if utility drops below one during\ntesting, and when utility exceeds one, tests multiple K-values to choose the\nutility-maximizing K for the set phase. We implement Cascade in vLLM and\nevaluate it on five popular MoEs with workloads spanning code, math,\nextraction, and mixed tasks. Cascade limits slowdown to 5% (vs. 1.5x) and\nimproves throughput by 7-14% over static K, making speculative decoding\npractical for MoEs."}

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations.

Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these\nmethods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading\nto catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different\nsources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift\ncalls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from\nretaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a\ngeneral adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To\naddress this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework\ndesigned to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable\nhistorical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster\nnumber determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real\ndrift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and\na concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful\nhistorical information.

This research\ninvestigates hybrid modeling strategies that integrate classical signal\nprocessing techniques with deep learning architectures to address this problem\nin low-resource scenarios. Two hybrid models were developed and evaluated: (1)\nMel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) combined with a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN), and (2) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) features combined with\na Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The models were trained on a dialect-filtered\nsubset of the Common Voice Arabic dataset, with dialect labels assigned based\non speaker metadata. Experimental results demonstrate that the MFCC + CNN\narchitecture achieved superior performance, with an accuracy of 91.2% and\nstrong precision, recall, and F1-scores, significantly outperforming the\nWavelet + RNN configuration, which achieved an accuracy of 66.5%.

A common\napproach treats unfamiliar attacks as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples;\nhowever, this leaves systems vulnerable when mitigation is inadequate.\nMoreover, conventional OOD detectors struggle to distinguish stealthy\nadversarial attacks from genuine OOD events. This paper introduces a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)-based framework for crafting\nstealthy adversarial attacks that evade IDS mechanisms. We first design a\nrobust multi-class IDS classifier trained on benign UAV telemetry and known\ncyber-attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), false data injection (FDI),\nman-in-the-middle (MiTM), and replay attacks. Using this classifier, our cGAN\nperturbs known attacks to generate adversarial samples that misclassify as\nbenign while retaining statistical resemblance to OOD distributions. These\nadversarial samples are iteratively refined to achieve high stealth and success\nrates. To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples. Comparative evaluation shows that CVAE-based\nregret scores significantly outperform traditional Mahalanobis distance-based\ndetectors in identifying stealthy adversarial threats.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way.

However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}.

This paper presents Synthline v1,\nan enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data\nthat extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and\ncuration techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how\nprompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation\ncuration affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect\ndetection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security\nvs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting\nsignificantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,\nwith F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic\nEditing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,\ngreatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing\nperformance on others.

A promising\nmitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet\ndetectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of\ngenerated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise\nwatermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at\nthe bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as\nresolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark\nsubtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed\nwhile remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,\nit exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are\nused to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will\nalso carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when\nonly fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked\nwith our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward\npreventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable\ndetection of generated outputs."}

Manually developing complex MTs is an error-prone and often\ninfeasible process. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an apt way to alleviate\nthese issues. In RL, an autonomous agent explores the state space through trial\nand error to identify beneficial sequences of actions, such as MTs. However, RL\nmethods exhibit performance issues in complex problems. In these situations,\nhuman guidance can be of high utility. In this paper, we present an approach\nand technical framework for developing complex MT sequences through RL, guided\nby potentially uncertain human advice. Our framework allows user-defined MTs to\nbe mapped onto RL primitives, and executes them as RL programs to find optimal\nMT sequences. Our evaluation shows that human guidance, even if uncertain,\nsubstantially improves RL performance, and results in more efficient\ndevelopment of complex MTs. Through a trade-off between the certainty and\ntimeliness of human advice, our method takes a step towards RL-driven\nhuman-in-the-loop engineering methods."}

Our model outperforms classical deep convolutional GANs\nand existing hybrid classical-quantum GANs in both image generation quality and\nclassification performance boost when used as data augmentation. Moreover, the\nperformance boost is comparable with that achieved using state-of-the-art\nclassical generative models, yet with over 25 times fewer parameters and 10\ntimes fewer training epochs. Such results suggest a promising future for\nquantum image generation as quantum hardware advances. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe robust performance of our model on real IBM quantum machine with hardware\nnoise."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs)\nshow strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with\ncontextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address\nthese challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework\nthat integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to\nperform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists\nof three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive\nconversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a\nsemantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the\ndrift as either benign or fraudulent.

Our work represents an initial attempt to tackle the challenges of\nmodeling complex real-world environments and embodied agent behaviors with\nvideo prediction from the perspective of a human."}
