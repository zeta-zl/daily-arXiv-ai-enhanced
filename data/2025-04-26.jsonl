In this paper, we explore the integration\nof multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory\nNetworks (GRNs).

Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with\nCIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K,\nwe show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly\nwith improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges\nsignificantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy,\nenabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within\nthe early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can\ndetermine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to\nunderfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that\nmaximizes validation scores.

Recent results for\nthe latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value\nequivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and\nmonotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse \"trivial\" equivalence\nclasses in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the\ncollapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant\nreductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing\nalgorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used\nas a fast pre-processing step in practice."}

While a\nnatural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text\ngeneration, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image\ngeneration. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right)\nguides autoregressive image generation models.

We prove that any hallucination\ndetection method can be converted into a language identification method, and\nconversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for\nhallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language\nidentification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally\nimpossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only\ncorrect examples from the target language.\n  Second, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the\ndetector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples\n(explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this\nconclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination\ndetection becomes possible for all countable language collections.\n  These results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in\ntraining hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for\nfeedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment."}

By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable\nnonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with\nthe degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we\ngeneralize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with\nfractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is\nmaximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in\nthe data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we\nfind that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed\ncorrectly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to\npropose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series\nby sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a\nsuccessful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its\npractical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by\naugmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir\nstates. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained\nscenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is\nimpractical or economically unviable.

This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework\nfor MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced\nexplainability.\n  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing\nclinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among\npatients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic\nTime Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as\ninputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and\nSupport Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel\ntransformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient\nsimilarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and\nt-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk\nclusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.\n  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from\nthe University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%.

We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from\nthe Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both\nsupportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit\ntopic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance.\nNotably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning\nmodels' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic\nentropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing\nbetween surface-level alignment from genuine belief.

The local model is learned by updating\nand fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are\nfixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware\nimplementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss\nfunction, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity.\nThen, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an\nintermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in\neach iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data\ndistribution.

This framework facilitates\ndesigning ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing\nmodels that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for\noperationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical\nfeasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric\nvalues. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law\nand ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its\napplication using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering."}

While LVLMs excel in\nmulti-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with\nhigh confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a\nmodel-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic\nthreshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning\ndata into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity\nscores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under\nuser-defined risk levels ($\\alpha$).

Traditional defect\ndetection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from\nlow efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches\nbased on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly,\ntheir reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties\nduring deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead\nto detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering\nautomated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first\nevaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data\nthat satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition\nwith test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration\nsample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate\nand false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous\nthreshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability\ndefective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g.,\ndefect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean\nerror rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk\nlevel. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average\nprediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a\nstatistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty.\nFurthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the\nexpected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning\nratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness."}
