Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies.

Although reranking itself is\nstandard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with\nLLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop\nquestions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra\ntraining or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG\nand HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy\n(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines."}

Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,\nbuild upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with\nsearch behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to\nboost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama\n3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through\na synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over\nmathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into\nnatural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries\nfrom failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during\nRL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve\nperformance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3\nfamily of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,\n26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon\nchallenging problems that require iterative correction.

However, accurately\nforecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due\nto the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of\niceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg\nmotion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a\nhighly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These\nlimitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture\nthe underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep\nlearning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift\nphysics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the\npattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth\nobservations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network\nthat captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future\niceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with\nstate-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings\ndemonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final\nDisplacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety\nof time points.

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,\nST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by\nenhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal\nrepresentations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves\nconsistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked\nmodeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods."}

First, despite\nempirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of\nself-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.\nSecond, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of\ntheir output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency\nduring their self-correction process. To better understand and address these\nparadoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora\ndesigned to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the\nheuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral\nself-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic\nshortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during\nself-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both\nself-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,\nwe propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the\nheuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges\nof this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and\nmodel scales."}

This is\nespecially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by\nperiodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains\nvaluable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer\nsome mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical\ndata for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply\nstoring and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating\nall historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying\nrelevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated\nusing a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation\nof previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,\ninvolving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently\nimproves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative\nobject detection frameworks."}

Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral\nand political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based\nsocial decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected\nwhen the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a\npressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect\nreciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.\nHere, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide\n21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate\n-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these\ninteractions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary\ngame-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where\nthe extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of\nLLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating\ncooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and\nbetween-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.\nWe show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact\nthe prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,\nshowing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through\ngoal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term\nsocial dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order\nto preserve human cooperation."}

While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have\nbeen developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of\ndimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a\npromising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from\npoor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the\ntarget distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new\nframework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.\nFirst, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and\nsurrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations\nwith uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection\nproblem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising\ncandidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.\nDuring posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly\nmulti-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when\nconstraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate\nthis issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the\nlatent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data\nspace.

However, PbRL can\nsuffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward\nmodel. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and\nfine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,\nusing different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose\nchallenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to\neffectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM\nassumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two\nparts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method\nsubstantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method\nachieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior\nrewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a\nnegated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka\nPanda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It\nsignificantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving\nsuccess in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at\nhttps://sunlighted.github.io/RRM-web/."}

To address\nthis limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely\nSCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval.

For auxiliary parameters, a\nlightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial\nand channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and\nchannel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using\nfour-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves\nan average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE\nreaches 0.432 m.

To test this dual encoding\nhypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture\nidentity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%\nreconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This\narchitecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared\nnorm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing\ndirectly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve\n16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of\ncomputational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention\nexperiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration\nfeatures exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and\nproduce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant\ninteraction effects across semantic dimensions.

We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers\nthat adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent\ndirections that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable\nthe optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show\nthat this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after\nsufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's\ninvariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in\nthe enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while\nthe original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin.

We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid\nframework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with\nmodel-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions\ndata and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy\nmodel to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by\ncomparing losses on kept versus pruned samples.

Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim\nmodels, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while\nmaintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the\nsusceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel\nbackdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed\nBadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency\nsensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed\ntriggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss\nthat strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by\naligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack\nsuccess rates while maintaining clean data accuracy.

We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.\nHowever, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their\nutilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from\nheightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced\nnorm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface\nbehavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying\ndrivers differ.

However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity\nfor multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and\nfrequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite\nmovement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within\nsingle-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the\nvast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in\nsuboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article\nproposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire\nmulti-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically\nforms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The\nformation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide\ntailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative\nstrategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial\nintelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite\naccess and mobility management.

This work addresses\nthis challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative\ndata to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.\n  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera\nviewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.\nIntraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the\npre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically\ncombining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization.

We build a recipe called $\\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners\nfor Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to\nreason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that\nbalances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical\ndesign choices: (1) a \"lightweight\" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,\nharmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many\nrefusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning\ncapabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive\nbehaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better\nsafety-refusal trade-offs.
