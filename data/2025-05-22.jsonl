Our approach formulates\ncurriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating\neach problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual\narm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy\nmeasure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum\npolicy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using\nthe TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive\nreasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly\nimproves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to\nharder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves\nbetter skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning\ndomains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL\nfine-tuning of LLMs."}

After feature engineering, the data were\naggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for\nmodel training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus,\nTSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using\nOptuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count\nwas 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best\nperformance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08,\nroot mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95.\nThe model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high\nboarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard\ndeviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts\nare achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong\nperformance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of\nadditional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions.\nThis framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital\nsystems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding."}

Instead of\nquantifying how causes influence effects as done traditionally, ACI solves an\ninverse problem via Bayesian data assimilation, thus tracing causes backward\nfrom observed effects with an implicit Bayesian hypothesis. Causality is\ndetermined by assessing whether incorporating the information of the effect\nvariables reduces the uncertainty in recovering the potential cause variables.\nACI has several desirable features. First, it captures the dynamic interplay of\nvariables, where their roles as causes and effects can shift repeatedly over\ntime.

This thesis develops both\nalgorithmic and theoretical foundations to address key reliability issues\narising from distributional uncertainty and unknown classes, from standard\nneural networks to modern foundation models like large language models (LLMs).\n  Traditional learning paradigms, such as empirical risk minimization (ERM),\nassume no distribution shift between training and inference, often leading to\noverconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This thesis\nintroduces novel frameworks that jointly optimize for in-distribution accuracy\nand reliability to unseen data. A core contribution is the development of an\nunknown-aware learning framework that enables models to recognize and handle\nnovel inputs without labeled OOD data.\n  We propose new outlier synthesis methods, VOS, NPOS, and DREAM-OOD, to\ngenerate informative unknowns during training. Building on this, we present\nSAL, a theoretical and algorithmic framework that leverages unlabeled\nin-the-wild data to enhance OOD detection under realistic deployment\nconditions. These methods demonstrate that abundant unlabeled data can be\nharnessed to recognize and adapt to unforeseen inputs, providing formal\nreliability guarantees.\n  The thesis also extends reliable learning to foundation models. We develop\nHaloScope for hallucination detection in LLMs, MLLMGuard for defending against\nmalicious prompts in multimodal models, and data cleaning methods to denoise\nhuman feedback used for better alignment. These tools target failure modes that\nthreaten the safety of large-scale models in deployment.\n  Overall, these contributions promote unknown-aware learning as a new\nparadigm, and we hope it can advance the reliability of AI systems with minimal\nhuman efforts."}

After feature engineering, the data were\naggregated at an hourly level, cleaned, and merged into a unified dataset for\nmodel training. Several time series deep learning models, including ResNetPlus,\nTSTPlus, TSiTPlus (from the tsai library), and N-BEATSx, were trained using\nOptuna and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The average ED boarding count\nwas 28.7, with a standard deviation of 11.2. N-BEATSx achieved the best\nperformance, with a mean absolute error of 2.10, mean squared error of 7.08,\nroot mean squared error of 2.66, and a coefficient of determination of 0.95.\nThe model maintained stable accuracy even during periods of extremely high\nboarding counts, defined as values exceeding one, two, or three standard\ndeviations above the mean. Results show that accurate six-hour-ahead forecasts\nare achievable without using patient-level clinical data. While strong\nperformance was observed even with a basic feature set, the inclusion of\nadditional features improved prediction stability under extreme conditions.\nThis framework offers a practical and generalizable approach for hospital\nsystems to anticipate boarding levels and help mitigate ED overcrowding."}

Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator.

This generative RL-trained\nverifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to\ndeterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual\nreinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both\ncomponents of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models:\nthe generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level\nmath benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the\nverifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset.

By cutting the parts that have little effect on the\ncomputation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation\ncomputation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient\nvariance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention\nmechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention\nbecomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically\nwith sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very\nsmall, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small\nfraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising\ntargets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule\ncontrolled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most\nattention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention\nhead. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the\nattention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear\ncomplexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical\ntransformer model, cutting $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing\n$c \\sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about\n$1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$.

However, scaling\nGCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse\nrewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive\nactions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong\nempirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on\nmodular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces\nsignificant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal\nspaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat\n(non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on\nsubgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our\napproach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space,\nwhich we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state\nspaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based\napproaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation.

Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency\nbands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz)\nand Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy,\nsuggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural\nprocesses.

To build trust in NCMs, researchers and practitioners must\nexplain code predictions. Associational interpretability, which identifies\ncorrelations, is often insufficient for tasks requiring intervention and change\nanalysis. To address this, the dissertation introduces DoCode, a novel post hoc\ninterpretability method for NCMs. DoCode uses causal inference to provide\nprogramming language-oriented explanations of model predictions. It follows a\nfour-step pipeline: modeling causal problems using Structural Causal Models\n(SCMs), identifying the causal estimand, estimating effects with metrics like\nAverage Treatment Effect (ATE), and refuting effect estimates. Its framework is\nextensible, with an example that reduces spurious correlations by grounding\nexplanations in programming language properties. A case study on deep code\ngeneration across interpretability scenarios and various deep learning\narchitectures demonstrates DoCode's benefits.

The dissertation also examines associational\ninterpretability as a foundation, analyzing software information's causal\nnature using tools like COMET and TraceXplainer for traceability.

We then demonstrate that\nexplicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can\nlead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and\ncomplex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we\nfind that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain\ncomparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn\nthan more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection\non the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math\nreasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and\nover-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more\nholistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our\nexperiments are released in https://github.com/thu-coai/LRM-Safety-Study."}

However,\nexisting ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are\ndesigned as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific\ntasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we\npropose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with\ntask-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs).\nGiven a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into\ndistinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task\nconditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each\nindividual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation.

Existing\nLLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like\nmanner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click\nhistory, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often\nleads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we\npropose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1\nto System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking\nactivation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and\ninjects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable\nreasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying\nuser preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this,\nwe propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning\ndifficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users'\nlatent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users,\nthereby enhancing precision and personalization.

Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of\nLLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring\nmodel responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort\nand captures only a limited set of social concepts.

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool\nfor power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault\nline identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability\ndepends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor\nfailures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a\nchallenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically\nvalidated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the\nimpact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate\nrealistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative\ninsights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by\napplying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model\nremains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\\pm$ 0.000 even after\na 50x data reduction.

Specifically,\nwe first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient\nreasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on\nthis perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method\n(LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target\nlength. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal\nbalance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff.

Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative\ndecoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models\nin an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper\nproposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the\nconfiguration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being\ngenerated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a\nMulti-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework\nBanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms,\nUCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity,\nthe stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and\nadversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility\nresult, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to\nuniversal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and\nQwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing\nmethods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in\nsimulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts."}

To bypass\nthese detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these\ntexts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require\nsubstantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser,\nand their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection\nalgorithms. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Co}ntrastive\n\\textbf{P}araphrase \\textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that\neffectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is\nto carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like\ntexts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can\nstill result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes\nthat can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an\nauxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like\ndistribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns\nfrom the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to\nproduce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors.

While recent\nAI progress has been driven by the training of large general-purpose foundation\nmodels, the creation of smaller models specialized for narrow domains could be\nvaluable for both efficiency and safety. In this work, we explore two\nchallenges involved in creating such systems, having to do with basic\nproperties of how neural networks learn and structure their representations.\nThe first challenge regards when it is possible to train narrow models from\nscratch. Through experiments on a synthetic task, we find that it is sometimes\nnecessary to train networks on a wide distribution of data to learn certain\nnarrow skills within that distribution. This effect arises when skills depend\non each other hierarchically, and training on a broad distribution introduces a\ncurriculum which substantially accelerates learning. The second challenge\nregards how to transfer particular skills from large general models into small\nspecialized models.

This study\nintegrated a purely data-driven ML model and two hybrid models (using the Biasi\nand Bowring CHF correlations) within the CTF subchannel code via a custom\nFortran framework. Performance was evaluated using two validation cases: a\nsubset of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission CHF database and the Bennett dryout\nexperiments. In both cases, the hybrid models exhibited significantly lower\nerror metrics in comparison with conventional empirical correlations. The pure\nML model remained competitive with the hybrid models. Trend analysis of error\nparity indicates that ML-based models reduce the tendency for CHF\noverprediction, improving overall accuracy. These results demonstrate that\nML-based CHF models can be effectively integrated into subchannel codes and can\npotentially increase performance in comparison with conventional methods."}

Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking\nand generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently\ntrain both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central\ninnovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is\ntrained via RL and co-evolves with the generator.

At the same time, automated\nassessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and\ntraining. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used\nto evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking\nand fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess\nrefusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot\nArena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how\ndifferent types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which\nexplicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., \"I can't help with that\nbecause it may be harmful\"), and technical refusals, which reflect system\nlimitations (e.g., \"I can't answer because I lack real-time data\"). We find\nthat LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more\nfavorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals.\nWe refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for\nmodel-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do.\nThis raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the\nnormative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems."}

This\npaper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that\ntackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously.

This paper proposes Coloring Between\nthe Lines (CBTL), a method for personalization that exploits the null space of\nconstraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) used in robot planning. CBTL begins\nwith a CSP generator that ensures safe and competent behavior, then\nincrementally personalizes behavior by learning parameterized constraints from\nonline interaction. By quantifying uncertainty and leveraging the\ncompositionality of planning constraints, CBTL achieves sample-efficient\nadaptation without environment resets. We evaluate CBTL in (1) three diverse\nsimulation environments; (2) a web-based user study; and (3) a real-robot\nassisted feeding system, finding that CBTL consistently achieves more effective\npersonalization with fewer interactions than baselines. Our results demonstrate\nthat CBTL provides a unified and practical approach for continual, flexible,\nactive, and safe robot personalization. Website:\nhttps://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/cbtl/"}

Next, we further extend LASER based\non two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during\ntraining, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and\ndynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of\nthought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be\ndifficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries.\nThis approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow\nthinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff.

Overall,\nthese results suggest that interpretability alone does not warrant trust, and\nunderscores the need for rigorous evaluation of interpretation stability in\nfuture work. To support these principles, we have developed and released an\nopen source IML dashboard and Python package to enable researchers to assess\nthe stability and reliability of their own data-driven interpretations and\ndiscoveries."}

Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even\nagainst Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates\nadversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search\nspace over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding\nsuccessful attacks difficult.

In this paper, we\nassess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed\nthreat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment\nprocess. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the\nintermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting\nas a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly\neffective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show\nour informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show\na gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack\nperformance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to\nsuccessfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective\nacross diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs,\neffective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses,\nthat these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit\nalignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together,\nour results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and\nthe need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs."}
