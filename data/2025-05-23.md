  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍了BR-TaxQA-R数据集，用于支持巴西个人所得税法的问答任务，并比较了RAG管道与商业工具的性能。

Motivation: 为巴西个人所得税法提供高质量的问答支持，并比较不同方法在生成答案时的表现。

Method: 基于RAG管道，使用OpenAI嵌入搜索和GPT-4o-mini生成答案，对比不同文本分割策略和商业工具。

Result: 自定义RAG管道在响应相关性上优于商业系统，而商业模型在事实准确性和流畅性上表现更好。

Conclusion: 人类专家评估在确保法律有效性上仍不可或缺，RAG管道在法律领域的应用需权衡生成质量与流畅性。

Abstract: This paper presents BR-TaxQA-R, a novel dataset designed to support question
answering with references in the context of Brazilian personal income tax law.
The dataset contains 715 questions from the 2024 official Q\&A document
published by Brazil's Internal Revenue Service, enriched with statutory norms
and administrative rulings from the Conselho Administrativo de Recursos Fiscais
(CARF). We implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using
OpenAI embeddings for searching and GPT-4o-mini for answer generation. We
compare different text segmentation strategies and benchmark our system against
commercial tools such as ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai using RAGAS-based metrics.
Results show that our custom RAG pipeline outperforms commercial systems in
Response Relevancy, indicating stronger alignment with user queries, while
commercial models achieve higher scores in Factual Correctness and fluency.
These findings highlight a trade-off between legally grounded generation and
linguistic fluency. Crucially, we argue that human expert evaluation remains
essential to ensure the legal validity of AI-generated answers in high-stakes
domains such as taxation. BR-TaxQA-R is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）中的概率知识，通过贝叶斯网络（BN）为现实世界事件生成概率估计，并在多个领域验证了其有效性。

Motivation: LLMs作为事实知识库的潜力已得到认可，但其在生成现实事件概率知识方面的能力尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索LLMs在这一领域的应用。

Method: 通过查询LLMs获取事件的条件概率，将其用于贝叶斯网络的参数化，并结合少量实际数据优化分布。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs生成的分布能有效减少系统偏差，且在80个公开贝叶斯网络（涵盖医疗和金融等领域）中表现优于随机和均匀分布的基线。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合LLMs概率知识与少量实际数据自动构建贝叶斯网络的新方法，并评估了多种提示策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as factual knowledge
bases; however, their capability to generate probabilistic knowledge about
real-world events remains understudied. This paper investigates using
probabilistic knowledge inherent in LLMs to derive probability estimates for
statements concerning events and their interrelationships captured via a
Bayesian Network (BN). Using LLMs in this context allows for the
parameterization of BNs, enabling probabilistic modeling within specific
domains. Experiments on eighty publicly available Bayesian Networks, from
healthcare to finance, demonstrate that querying LLMs about the conditional
probabilities of events provides meaningful results when compared to baselines,
including random and uniform distributions, as well as approaches based on
next-token generation probabilities. We explore how these LLM-derived
distributions can serve as expert priors to refine distributions extracted from
minimal data, significantly reducing systematic biases. Overall, this work
introduces a promising strategy for automatically constructing Bayesian
Networks by combining probabilistic knowledge extracted from LLMs with small
amounts of real-world data. Additionally, we evaluate several prompting
strategies for eliciting probabilistic knowledge from LLMs and establish the
first comprehensive baseline for assessing LLM performance in extracting
probabilistic knowledge.

### [3] [Aligning Dialogue Agents with Global Feedback via Large Language Model Reward Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15922)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型的奖励分解框架，利用单一会话级反馈信号对齐对话代理。

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计奖励和细粒度人类反馈，本文旨在减少这种依赖，利用大型语言模型自动分解奖励。

Method: 1. 文本版本：仅用对话文本提示LLM分解奖励；2. 多模态版本：加入行为线索（如音调、视线、面部表情）的自然语言描述。奖励被蒸馏为轻量模型，用于强化学习微调。

Result: 在会话质量的人类评估中，两种版本均优于现有奖励分解方法，表明LLM是强大的奖励分解工具。

Conclusion: LLM能够自动分解奖励，无需手动设计或细粒度人类反馈，显著提升对话质量。

Abstract: We propose a large language model based reward decomposition framework for
aligning dialogue agents using only a single session-level feedback signal. We
leverage the reasoning capabilities of a frozen, pretrained large language
model (LLM) to infer fine-grained local implicit rewards by decomposing global,
session-level feedback. Our first text-only variant prompts the LLM to perform
reward decomposition using only the dialogue transcript. The second multimodal
variant incorporates additional behavioral cues, such as pitch, gaze, and
facial affect, expressed as natural language descriptions. These inferred
turn-level rewards are distilled into a lightweight reward model, which we
utilize for RL-based fine-tuning for dialogue generation. We evaluate both
text-only and multimodal variants against state-of-the-art reward decomposition
methods and demonstrate notable improvements in human evaluations of
conversation quality, suggesting that LLMs are strong reward decomposers that
obviate the need for manual reward shaping and granular human feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用开源语言模型改进全球知识共享网络中的引用解析工具，以解决全球南方学者在知识生产中的不平等问题。

Motivation: 旨在解决全球南方学者在知识索引服务中被边缘化的问题，改善知识共享网络的透明度。

Method: 通过开源语言模型对文献引用进行标注，并使用匹配的纯文本和标注引用数据集进行验证。

Result: 研究发现，现有语言模型在识别引用组成部分时表现出高准确度，尤其是小型模型Qwen3-0.6B表现出色。

Conclusion: 这类工具能够显著提升引用网络的准确性，促进研究索引和发现的改进。

Abstract: A key type of resource needed to address global inequalities in knowledge
production and dissemination is a tool that can support journals in
understanding how knowledge circulates. The absence of such a tool has resulted
in comparatively less information about networks of knowledge sharing in the
Global South. In turn, this gap authorizes the exclusion of researchers and
scholars from the South in indexing services, reinforcing colonial arrangements
that de-center and minoritize those scholars. In order to support citation
network tracking on a global scale, we investigate the capacity of open-weight
language models to mark up manuscript citations in an indexable format. We
assembled a dataset of matched plaintext and annotated citations from preprints
and published research papers. Then, we evaluated a number of open-weight
language models on the annotation task. We find that, even out of the box,
today's language models achieve high levels of accuracy on identifying the
constituent components of each citation, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, the smallest model we evaluated, Qwen3-0.6B, can parse all
fields with high accuracy in $2^5$ passes, suggesting that post-training is
likely to be effective in producing small, robust citation parsing models. Such
a tool could greatly improve the fidelity of citation networks and thus
meaningfully improve research indexing and discovery, as well as further
metascientific research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出FoVer方法，利用形式化验证工具自动标注步骤级错误标签训练PRMs，减少人工标注成本并提升跨任务泛化能力。

Motivation: 解决PRMs训练依赖高成本人工标注和仅适用于数学推理的局限性。

Method: 使用形式化验证工具（如Z3和Isabelle）自动标注步骤级错误标签，合成训练数据集。

Result: FoVer训练的PRMs在12个推理基准测试中表现优异，超越基线模型并与人工标注的PRMs竞争。

Conclusion: FoVer方法可扩展PRMs到多样化推理任务，同时降低标注成本。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs), which provide step-by-step feedback on the
reasoning generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), are receiving increasing
attention. However, two key research gaps remain: collecting accurate
step-level error labels for training typically requires costly human
annotation, and existing PRMs are limited to math reasoning problems. In
response to these gaps, this paper aims to address the challenges of automatic
dataset creation and the generalization of PRMs to diverse reasoning tasks. To
achieve this goal, we propose FoVer, an approach for training PRMs on
step-level error labels automatically annotated by formal verification tools,
such as Z3 for formal logic and Isabelle for theorem proof, which provide
automatic and accurate verification for symbolic tasks. Using this approach, we
synthesize a training dataset with error labels on LLM responses for formal
logic and theorem proof tasks without human annotation. Although this data
synthesis is feasible only for tasks compatible with formal verification, we
observe that LLM-based PRMs trained on our dataset exhibit cross-task
generalization, improving verification across diverse reasoning tasks.
Specifically, PRMs trained with FoVer significantly outperform baseline PRMs
based on the original LLMs and achieve competitive or superior results compared
to state-of-the-art PRMs trained on labels annotated by humans or stronger
models, as measured by step-level verification on ProcessBench and Best-of-K
performance across 12 reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME, ANLI, MMLU,
and BBH. The datasets, models, and code are provided at
https://github.com/psunlpgroup/FoVer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型语言模型LMLM，通过将事实知识存储在外部数据库中，减少模型内部权重的依赖，提供可编辑和验证的知识库。

Motivation: 解决传统神经网络语言模型因知识分布不透明而难以准确更新和验证事实的问题。

Method: 提出LMLM模型，结合内部权重与外部数据库存储知识，并通过遮蔽外部检索值引导模型学习查找而非记忆。

Result: LMLM在性能上媲美更大的知识密集型LLM，同时具备知识库的可编辑和可验证优势。

Conclusion: LMLM为语言模型管理与事实知识交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes -- both linguistic patterns and
factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This
entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update
specific facts. We propose a new class of language models, Large Memory
Language Models (LMLM) with a pre-training recipe that stores factual knowledge
in both internal weights and an external database. Our approach strategically
masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby
teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on
memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve
competitive performance compared to significantly larger, knowledge-dense LLMs
on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable,
and verifiable knowledge bases. This work represents a fundamental shift in how
language models interact with and manage factual knowledge.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在人类-AI协作决策中的成功取决于其提供可信、渐进且定制化解释的能力。研究评估了五个LLMs在解决和解释6x6数独谜题时的表现，发现它们在解释过程中缺乏战略性推理或直观问题解决能力。

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在人类-AI协作决策中的潜力，尤其关注其在提供解释方面的能力。

Method: 通过评估五个LLMs在解决和解释6x6数独谜题时的表现。

Result: 虽然一个LLM在解决谜题方面表现出限成功，但所有模型均无法提供反映战略性推理或直观问题解决的解释。

Conclusion: LLMs在成为有效的协作决策伙伴前仍需解决重大挑战。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in human-AI collaborative
decision-making hinges on their ability to provide trustworthy, gradual, and
tailored explanations. Solving complex puzzles, such as Sudoku, offers a
canonical example of this collaboration, where clear and customized
explanations often hold greater importance than the final solution. In this
study, we evaluate the performance of five LLMs in solving and explaining
\sixsix{} Sudoku puzzles. While one LLM demonstrates limited success in solving
puzzles, none can explain the solution process in a manner that reflects
strategic reasoning or intuitive problem-solving. These findings underscore
significant challenges that must be addressed before LLMs can become effective
partners in human-AI collaborative decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索了如何通过利用在线数据（如医学杂志和医患问答对）来增强小语言模型在波斯语医学领域的知识，并通过微调基线模型提高了其在医学问答中的准确性。

Motivation: 目前波斯语等低资源语言在医学领域的专业数据缺乏，小语言模型表现不佳，因此需要探索利用开放数据提升模型性能。

Method: 通过爬取医学杂志和收集真实的医患问答对构建数据集，并对基线模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的模型在医学问答中表现出更高的准确性，能提供更好的回答。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了利用开放数据提升小语言模型在医学领域性能的潜力，为资源受限环境下的波斯语医学AI应用提供了新方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of
artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language
models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like
Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated
dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This
study explores the enhancement of medical knowledge in a small language model
by leveraging accessible online data, including a crawled corpus from medical
magazines and a dataset of real doctor-patient QA pairs. We fine-tuned a
baseline model using our curated data to improve its medical knowledge.
Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved
accuracy in medical question answering and provides better responses compared
to its baseline. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access
online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a
novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for
resource-constrained environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何通过因果解释方法增强LLMs对语言学理论的贡献，尤其是英语填充-缺口依赖结构。实验表明LLMs对这些结构的抽象分析具有一致性，并揭示了频率、填充类型和上下文等新因素，可能推动语言学理论的革新。

Motivation: 通过因果解释方法揭示LLMs学习的抽象机制，增强LLMs作为语言学理论证据的价值。

Method: 使用分布式交换干预实验分析LLMs对英语填充-缺口依赖结构的抽象分析。

Result: LLMs对填充-缺口结构的分析具有一致性，并揭示了频率、填充类型和上下文等新因素。

Conclusion: LLMs的机制性内部分析可以推动语言学理论的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for
linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that
causal interpretability methods, applied to LLMs, can greatly enhance the value
of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LLMs
learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler-gap dependency
constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely
agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based
in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LLMs converge on similar
abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously
overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding
context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall,
these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LLMs can push
linguistic theory forward.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-as-a-Judge范式为语言模型评估提供了可扩展、无参考的方法，但现有校准技术主要适用于结构化任务。本文提出SLMEval方法，通过熵最大化校准，显著提升了在真实开放任务中与人类判断的相关性，同时大幅降低了评估成本。

Motivation: 探究现有校准技术在真实、开放任务中的泛化能力，发现其表现不佳，甚至与人类判断负相关。

Method: 提出SLMEval方法，利用少量人类偏好数据，通过熵最大化和得分重加权实现校准。

Result: SLMEval在两个真实生产用例和公开基准上均与人类判断强相关（如Spearman相关系数0.57），且评估成本降低5-30倍。

Conclusion: SLMEval有效解决了现有校准技术在实际开放任务中的局限性，显著提升了评估质量和效率。

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm offers a scalable, reference-free approach for
evaluating language models. Although several calibration techniques have been
proposed to better align these evaluators with human judgment, prior studies
focus primarily on narrow, well-structured benchmarks. As a result, it remains
unclear whether such calibrations generalize to real-world, open-ended tasks.
  In this work, we show that SOTA calibrated evaluators often fail in these
settings, exhibiting weak or even negative correlation with human judgments. To
address this, we propose SLMEval, a novel and efficient calibration method
based on entropy maximization over a small amount of human preference data. By
estimating a latent distribution over model quality and reweighting evaluator
scores accordingly, SLMEval achieves strong correlation with human evaluations
across two real-world production use cases and the public benchmark. For
example, on one such task, SLMEval achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.57 with
human judgments, while G-Eval yields a negative correlation. In addition,
SLMEval reduces evaluation costs by 5-30x compared to GPT-4-based calibrated
evaluators such as G-eval.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAGO是一种新颖的少样本跨语言嵌入反演攻击方法，通过图优化框架显式建模语言关系，显著提升攻击的可迁移性。

Motivation: 解决多语言NLP系统中的隐私漏洞，现有方法忽略语言间关系，导致反演攻击效果受限。

Method: 基于图优化的约束分布式优化框架，结合句法和词汇相似性作为边约束，跨相关语言进行参数协同学习。

Result: 实验表明，LAGO在极少样本（每语言仅10个样本）下显著提升攻击效果，Rouge-L得分提高10-20%。

Conclusion: 语言相似性是反演攻击可迁移性的关键因素，需重视语言感知的隐私保护嵌入方法。

Abstract: We propose LAGO - Language Similarity-Aware Graph Optimization - a novel
approach for few-shot cross-lingual embedding inversion attacks, addressing
critical privacy vulnerabilities in multilingual NLP systems. Unlike prior work
in embedding inversion attacks that treat languages independently, LAGO
explicitly models linguistic relationships through a graph-based constrained
distributed optimization framework. By integrating syntactic and lexical
similarity as edge constraints, our method enables collaborative parameter
learning across related languages. Theoretically, we show this formulation
generalizes prior approaches, such as ALGEN, which emerges as a special case
when similarity constraints are relaxed. Our framework uniquely combines
Frobenius-norm regularization with linear inequality or total variation
constraints, ensuring robust alignment of cross-lingual embedding spaces even
with extremely limited data (as few as 10 samples per language). Extensive
experiments across multiple languages and embedding models demonstrate that
LAGO substantially improves the transferability of attacks with 10-20% increase
in Rouge-L score over baselines. This work establishes language similarity as a
critical factor in inversion attack transferability, urging renewed focus on
language-aware privacy-preserving multilingual embeddings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: METEORA是一种新的RAG方法，通过基于理性的选择替代传统的相似性重排序，提高了生成准确性、解释性和对抗恶意内容的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 解决传统RAG方法依赖启发式相似性和缺乏解释性、鲁棒性的问题。

Method: METEORA采用两阶段框架：基于偏好的理性生成和理性驱动的证据块选择，包括局部相关性配对、全局选择和上下文扩展。

Result: 在多个领域数据集中，METEORA提高生成准确性33.34%，减少50%使用的块，显著提升对抗攻击下的F1分数。

Conclusion: METEORA通过理性驱动的方法显著改进了RAG的解释性、准确性和对抗性。

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines rely on
similarity-based retrieval and re-ranking, which depend on heuristics such as
top-k, and lack explainability, interpretability, and robustness against
adversarial content. To address this gap, we propose a novel method METEORA
that replaces re-ranking in RAG with a rationale-driven selection approach.
METEORA operates in two stages. First, a general-purpose LLM is
preference-tuned to generate rationales conditioned on the input query using
direct preference optimization. These rationales guide the evidence chunk
selection engine, which selects relevant chunks in three stages: pairing
individual rationales with corresponding retrieved chunks for local relevance,
global selection with elbow detection for adaptive cutoff, and context
expansion via neighboring chunks. This process eliminates the need for top-k
heuristics. The rationales are also used for consistency check using a Verifier
LLM to detect and filter poisoned or misleading content for safe generation.
The framework provides explainable and interpretable evidence flow by using
rationales consistently across both selection and verification. Our evaluation
across six datasets spanning legal, financial, and academic research domains
shows that METEORA improves generation accuracy by 33.34% while using
approximately 50% fewer chunks than state-of-the-art re-ranking methods. In
adversarial settings, METEORA significantly improves the F1 score from 0.10 to
0.44 over the state-of-the-art perplexity-based defense baseline, demonstrating
strong resilience to poisoning attacks. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部验证器的强化学习框架NOVER，适用于广泛的文本任务，性能优于同类模型。

Motivation: 现有基于奖励的强化学习方法依赖外部验证器，限制了应用范围。NOVER解决了这一问题，无需验证器即可训练。

Method: 提出NOVER框架，仅需标准的监督微调数据，无需外部验证器，支持多种文本任务优化。

Result: NOVER性能优于同规模的大型推理模型，提升7.7%，并支持反向激励训练等新优化方式。

Conclusion: NOVER突破了依赖验证器的限制，为语言模型优化提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances such as DeepSeek R1-Zero highlight the effectiveness of
incentive training, a reinforcement learning paradigm that computes rewards
solely based on the final answer part of a language model's output, thereby
encouraging the generation of intermediate reasoning steps. However, these
methods fundamentally rely on external verifiers, which limits their
applicability to domains like mathematics and coding where such verifiers are
readily available. Although reward models can serve as verifiers, they require
high-quality annotated data and are costly to train. In this work, we propose
NOVER, NO-VERifier Reinforcement Learning, a general reinforcement learning
framework that requires only standard supervised fine-tuning data with no need
for an external verifier. NOVER enables incentive training across a wide range
of text-to-text tasks and outperforms the model of the same size distilled from
large reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 671B by 7.7 percent. Moreover, the
flexibility of NOVER enables new possibilities for optimizing large language
models, such as inverse incentive training.

Method: 通过分析用户与Bing Copilot和WildChat的实际交互数据，识别并分类用户行为（PATHs），并统计其与写作意图的关联。

Result: 少数PATHs（如修订意图、探索文本、提问等）能解释大部分交互变化；用户意图与特定PATHs显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究发现为LLM对齐提供了新见解，强调用户意图在协作中的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are used in complex writing workflows, users
engage in multi-turn interactions to steer generations to better fit their
needs. Rather than passively accepting output, users actively refine, explore,
and co-construct text. We conduct a large-scale analysis of this collaborative
behavior for users engaged in writing tasks in the wild with two popular AI
assistants, Bing Copilot and WildChat. Our analysis goes beyond simple task
classification or satisfaction estimation common in prior work and instead
characterizes how users interact with LLMs through the course of a session. We
identify prototypical behaviors in how users interact with LLMs in prompts
following their original request. We refer to these as Prototypical Human-AI
Collaboration Behaviors (PATHs) and find that a small group of PATHs explain a
majority of the variation seen in user-LLM interaction. These PATHs span users
revising intents, exploring texts, posing questions, adjusting style or
injecting new content. Next, we find statistically significant correlations
between specific writing intents and PATHs, revealing how users' intents shape
their collaboration behaviors. We conclude by discussing the implications of
our findings on LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对29个开源大语言模型进行了广泛的伦理评估，填补了现有评估在广度、语言覆盖和模型多样性上的不足。

Motivation: 生成式大语言模型潜力巨大，但也引发伦理担忧。现有研究多关注狭窄的伦理维度，且语言和模型多样性不足。

Method: 使用包括鲁棒性、可靠性、安全性和公平性四个伦理维度的新数据集，评估了英文和土耳其语（低资源语言）中的模型行为。

Result: 优化工作更注重安全性和公平性，鲁棒性良好但可靠性存忧。参数更多的模型表现更好，Gemma和Qwen表现出最优伦理行为。

Conclusion: 伦理评估可独立于语言进行，大参数模型表现更优，需继续提升可靠性。

Abstract: Generative large language models present significant potential but also raise
critical ethical concerns. Most studies focus on narrow ethical dimensions, and
also limited diversity of languages and models. To address these gaps, we
conduct a broad ethical evaluation of 29 recent open-source large language
models using a novel data collection including four ethical aspects:
Robustness, reliability, safety, and fairness. We analyze model behavior in
both a commonly used language, English, and a low-resource language, Turkish.
Our aim is to provide a comprehensive ethical assessment and guide safer model
development by filling existing gaps in evaluation breadth, language coverage,
and model diversity. Our experimental results, based on LLM-as-a-Judge, reveal
that optimization efforts for many open-source models appear to have
prioritized safety and fairness, and demonstrated good robustness while
reliability remains a concern. We demonstrate that ethical evaluation can be
effectively conducted independently of the language used. In addition, models
with larger parameter counts tend to exhibit better ethical performance, with
Gemma and Qwen models demonstrating the most ethical behavior among those
evaluated.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了1979至2024年间发表在顶级自然语言处理（NLP）会议上的研究的内部及外部影响力，发现语言建模在学术界和公众中影响最广，而语言学基础影响较小。伦理、偏见和公平性在政策文件中受到更多关注，但学术引用较少。外部领域对NLP的关注点各异。

Motivation: 研究旨在了解NLP研究在不同领域的传播和影响，揭示其学术与社会价值的差异。

Method: 通过分析研究文章和外部来源（如专利、媒体和政策文件）的引用情况，评估NLP主题的影响力。

Result: 语言建模影响力最广，语言学基础影响力较低。伦理相关主题在政策文件中受关注但学术引用少。

Conclusion: NLP研究的影响因主题和受众而异，需平衡学术与社会需求。

Abstract: We investigate the impacts of NLP research published in top-tier conferences
(i.e., ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL) from 1979 to 2024. By analyzing citations from
research articles and external sources such as patents, media, and policy
documents, we examine how different NLP topics are consumed both within the
academic community and by the broader public. Our findings reveal that language
modeling has the widest internal and external influence, while linguistic
foundations have lower impacts. We also observe that internal and external
impacts generally align, but topics like ethics, bias, and fairness show
significant attention in policy documents with much fewer academic citations.
Additionally, external domains exhibit distinct preferences, with patents
focusing on practical NLP applications and media and policy documents engaging
more with the societal implications of NLP models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何在工业场景中使用较小的Transformer模型（如Llama）进行文本分类，并比较了提示工程与监督微调方法的效果，重点关注性能和显存效率。

Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等模型的出现，解码器模型在文本分类中表现出色，但其推理效率低且依赖高质量提示。本文旨在研究小型模型能否有效处理文本分类任务。

Method: 通过综合评估提示工程和监督微调方法，在工业场景（如邮件分类、法律文档分类、长学术文本分类）中测试小型模型的性能与显存效率。

Result: 研究表明小型模型在文本分类任务中表现良好，同时显存利用率高，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: 小型Transformer模型在工业场景中具有实际应用潜力，尤其是在效率和资源受限的情况下。

Abstract: With the emergence of ChatGPT, Transformer models have significantly advanced
text classification and related tasks. Decoder-only models such as Llama
exhibit strong performance and flexibility, yet they suffer from inefficiency
on inference due to token-by-token generation, and their effectiveness in text
classification tasks heavily depends on prompt quality. Moreover, their
substantial GPU resource requirements often limit widespread adoption. Thus,
the question of whether smaller language models are capable of effectively
handling text classification tasks emerges as a topic of significant interest.
However, the selection of appropriate models and methodologies remains largely
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompt
engineering and supervised fine-tuning methods for transformer-based text
classification. Specifically, we focus on practical industrial scenarios,
including email classification, legal document categorization, and the
classification of extremely long academic texts. We examine the strengths and
limitations of smaller models, with particular attention to both their
performance and their efficiency in Video Random-Access Memory (VRAM)
utilization, thereby providing valuable insights for the local deployment and
application of compact models in industrial settings.

TL;DR: BiasLab是一个包含300篇政治新闻的数据集，标注了感知的意识形态偏见，用于可解释的偏见检测和建模。

Motivation: 开发一个带有丰富标注的数据集，以支持透明、社会意识的自然语言处理系统，并研究偏见感知的可解释性。

Method: 通过众包标注，对新闻文章进行两党情感评分和理性标注，并结合GPT-4o模拟标注以比较人类标签。

Result: 量化了标注者间一致性，分析了与媒体偏见的差异，并展示了基线模型在偏见感知和理性分类任务中的表现。

Conclusion: BiasLab的数据和工具为研究偏见感知和解释性模型提供了资源，推动了可解释NLP的发展。

Abstract: We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for
perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated
900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each
article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing
sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with
rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker
qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify
inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias,
and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we
simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison
to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in
misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks:
perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report
baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection.
BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that
facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development
of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation
schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop
interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world
settings.

TL;DR: BPE tokenizers的分词方式可能导致日历日期被分割为无意义的片段，影响时间推理。作者提出了日期碎片化比率度量标准，发布了DateAugBench测试集，并发现大模型通过碎片拼接机制完成时间推理。

Motivation: 解决BPE tokenizers对日期的碎片化分割问题，以提升时间推理的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了日期碎片化比率度量标准，创建DateAugBench测试集，并通过层间探测和因果注意力分析研究大模型的日期抽象机制。

Result: 过度碎片化导致罕见日期（如历史和未来日期）的准确率下降高达10%；模型越大，碎片拼接机制实现得越快。

Conclusion: 大模型通过独特的推理路径（年月日顺序）拼接日期碎片，这与人类的理解方式不同。

Abstract: Modern BPE tokenizers often split calendar dates into meaningless fragments,
e.g., 20250312 $\rightarrow$ 202, 503, 12, inflating token counts and obscuring
the inherent structure needed for robust temporal reasoning. In this work, we
(1) introduce a simple yet interpretable metric, termed date fragmentation
ratio, that measures how faithfully a tokenizer preserves multi-digit date
components; (2) release DateAugBench, a suite of 6500 examples spanning three
temporal reasoning tasks: context-based date resolution, format-invariance
puzzles, and date arithmetic across historical, contemporary, and future
regimes; and (3) through layer-wise probing and causal attention-hop analyses,
uncover an emergent date-abstraction mechanism whereby large language models
stitch together the fragments of month, day, and year components for temporal
reasoning. Our experiments show that excessive fragmentation correlates with
accuracy drops of up to 10 points on uncommon dates like historical and
futuristic dates. Further, we find that the larger the model, the faster the
emergent date abstraction that heals date fragments is accomplished. Lastly, we
observe a reasoning path that LLMs follow to assemble date fragments, typically
differing from human interpretation (year $\rightarrow$ month $\rightarrow$
day).

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一种名为bRAGgen的新型自适应生成模型，用于解决代谢手术前后患者信息获取的障碍，并提供了一个大型数据集bRAGq作为评估基准。

Motivation: 代谢手术治疗的疗效依赖于患者与多学科团队的长期互动，但医疗差异和访问障碍限制了信息的及时获取。

Method: 开发了基于检索增强生成（RAG）的自适应模型bRAGgen，并在bRAGq数据集上进行了两阶段评估。

Result: bRAGgen在所有评估维度上均表现出明显优于其他模型的性能。

Conclusion: bRAGgen能够生成临床准确且相关的响应，有助于改善代谢手术患者的信息获取。

Abstract: While bariatric and metabolic surgery (MBS) is considered the gold standard
treatment for severe and morbid obesity, its therapeutic efficacy hinges upon
active and longitudinal engagement with multidisciplinary providers, including
surgeons, dietitians/nutritionists, psychologists, and endocrinologists. This
engagement spans the entire patient journey, from preoperative preparation to
long-term postoperative management. However, this process is often hindered by
numerous healthcare disparities, such as logistical and access barriers, which
impair easy patient access to timely, evidence-based, clinician-endorsed
information. To address these gaps, we introduce bRAGgen, a novel adaptive
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based model that autonomously integrates
real-time medical evidence when response confidence dips below dynamic
thresholds. This self-updating architecture ensures that responses remain
current and accurate, reducing the risk of misinformation. Additionally, we
present bRAGq, a curated dataset of 1,302 bariatric surgery--related questions,
validated by an expert bariatric surgeon. bRAGq constitutes the first
large-scale, domain-specific benchmark for comprehensive MBS care. In a
two-phase evaluation, bRAGgen is benchmarked against state-of-the-art models
using both large language model (LLM)--based metrics and expert surgeon review.
Across all evaluation dimensions, bRAGgen demonstrates substantially superior
performance in generating clinically accurate and relevant responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为分层安全重对齐（HSR）的轻量级方法，用于解决大规模视觉语言模型（LVLM）剪枝后安全性能下降的问题。

Motivation: 随着LVLM模型规模的增大，网络剪枝技术虽能压缩模型以适配资源受限环境，但通常会导致安全性能下降，需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: HSR通过量化每个注意力头对安全的贡献，识别关键注意力头，并选择性恢复这些头中与安全密切相关的神经元，实现从注意力头层面到神经元层面的分层安全重对齐。

Result: 在多种模型和剪枝策略下验证了HSR的有效性，显著提升了剪枝后模型的安全性能。

Conclusion: HSR是第一个明确专注于在剪枝后恢复LVLM安全性的工作，具有创新性和实用性。

Abstract: With the increasing size of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), network
pruning techniques aimed at compressing models for deployment in
resource-constrained environments have garnered significant attention. However,
we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To
address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed
Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the
contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical
ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention
heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process
hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the
attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models
and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on
restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MPL的新框架，通过结合多种编程语言（PLs）和函数提示，优化信息提取（IE）任务中的结构化输出生成。

Motivation: 当前信息提取研究主要依赖Python模拟代码风格输入，忽视了其他广泛使用的编程语言（如C++和Java）在监督微调（SFT）阶段的潜力。

Method: 提出了MPL框架，结合多种编程语言和虚拟运行的函数提示，以更高效地模拟代码风格输入。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了MPL的有效性，并通过广泛实验提供了全面分析。

Conclusion: MPL框架通过引入多种编程语言和高效的代码风格模拟方法，显著提升了信息提取任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent research in information extraction (IE) focuses on utilizing
code-style inputs to enhance structured output generation. The intuition behind
this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater
structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage
makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research
primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the
potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple
\textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for
information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that
explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase.
Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to
simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental
results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL.
Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive
analysis. We have released our code for future research.

introduces a dual-method LLM framework: unsupervised expectation extraction
from UGC paired with survey-informed supervised fine-tuning. Findings reveal
leisure/social expectations drive engagement more than foundational
natural/emotional factors. By establishing LLMs as precision tools for
expectation quantification, we advance tourism analytics methodology and
propose targeted strategies for experience personalization and social travel
promotion. The framework's adaptability extends to consumer behavior research,

TL;DR: KoBALT 是一个针对韩语的综合性语言学基准，包含 700 道选择题，覆盖 5 个语言学领域，用于评估大型语言模型的表现。

Motivation: 解决现有基准缺乏语言学深度和类型学基础的问题，提升韩语语言模型的评估质量。

Method: 设计了专家策划的语言学问题，减少与标准韩语语料库的 n-gram 重叠，避免数据污染。

Result: 评估了 20 个 LLMs，最高准确率为 61%，但不同领域表现差异显著（如语义 66%，音系 31%）。人类评估验证了基准的有效性。

Conclusion: KoBALT填补了韩语语言学评估的空白，为评估语言模型的真实语言能力提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: We introduce KoBALT (Korean Benchmark for Advanced Linguistic Tasks), a
comprehensive linguistically-motivated benchmark comprising 700 multiple-choice
questions spanning 24 phenomena across five linguistic domains: syntax,
semantics, pragmatics, phonetics/phonology, and morphology. KoBALT is designed
to advance the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in Korean, a
morphologically rich language, by addressing the limitations of conventional
benchmarks that often lack linguistic depth and typological grounding. It
introduces a suite of expert-curated, linguistically motivated questions with
minimal n-gram overlap with standard Korean corpora, substantially mitigating
the risk of data contamination and allowing a more robust assessment of true
language understanding. Our evaluation of 20 contemporary LLMs reveals
significant performance disparities, with the highest-performing model
achieving 61\% general accuracy but showing substantial variation across
linguistic domains - from stronger performance in semantics (66\%) to
considerable weaknesses in phonology (31\%) and morphology (36\%). Through
human preference evaluation with 95 annotators, we demonstrate a strong
correlation between KoBALT scores and human judgments, validating our
benchmark's effectiveness as a discriminative measure of Korean language
understanding. KoBALT addresses critical gaps in linguistic evaluation for
typologically diverse languages and provides a robust framework for assessing
genuine linguistic competence in Korean language models.

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管大语言模型（LLMs）明确反对人口统计学刻板印象，但在不同社会情境下仍表现出偏见。实验揭示了两种形式的真实性偏见：归因偏见和评估偏见。

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在人口统计学刻板印象上有明确的对齐，但在各种社会情境中仍表现出偏见，引发对其在教育与评估环境中部署的担忧。

Method: 通过对五个符合人类价值观的LLMs在数学、编码、常识和写作问题上进行实验，揭示归因偏见和评估偏见。

Result: LLMs在数学和编码任务中更少地将正确答案归因于非裔美国人群体，同时在写作评估中最不偏好亚洲作者。此外，LLMs在可视化代码中自动为人口统计群体分配种族刻板颜色。

Conclusion: 人口统计学偏见超出了表面刻板印象和社会情境触发，嵌入模型的推理过程中，对LLMs在教育与评估环境中的使用提出警告。

Abstract: Despite LLMs' explicit alignment against demographic stereotypes, they have
been shown to exhibit biases under various social contexts. In this work, we
find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution
veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned
LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two
forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models
disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups,
and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies
based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases:
LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to
African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least
preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs
automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in
visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models'
reasoning processes. Our findings indicate that demographic bias extends beyond
surface-level stereotypes and social context provocations, raising concerns
about LLMs' deployment in educational and evaluation settings.

Result: 在8种LLMs和8种语言对上广泛评估，该方法优于直接评分和非LLM的无参考指标。

Conclusion: 基于生成的评估方法结合流畅生成与准确语义评估，效果显著。

Abstract: Recent studies have applied large language models (LLMs) to machine
translation quality estimation (MTQE) by prompting models to assign numeric
scores. Nonetheless, these direct scoring methods tend to show low
segment-level correlation with human judgments. In this paper, we propose a
generation-based evaluation paradigm that leverages decoder-only LLMs to
produce high-quality references, followed by semantic similarity scoring using
sentence embeddings. We conduct the most extensive evaluation to date in MTQE,
covering 8 LLMs and 8 language pairs. Empirical results show that our method
outperforms both intra-LLM direct scoring baselines and external non-LLM
reference-free metrics from MTME. These findings demonstrate the strength of
generation-based evaluation and support a shift toward hybrid approaches that
combine fluent generation with accurate semantic assessment.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型在五种不同语言中的位置偏见，发现其与模型驱动因素、提示工程和语言多样性有关。

Motivation: 揭示大语言模型中位置偏见的本质及其与语言多样性的关系，填补当前研究的空白。

Method: 跨语言研究（英语、俄语、德语、印地语、越南语），分析位置偏见与模型不确定性、语法和提示的交互作用。

Result: 1. 位置偏见是模型驱动的，且存在语言差异；2. 明确的定位指导会降低准确性；3. 语境对齐会增加熵值，但最小熵不预测准确性；4. 在自由语序语言（如印地语）中，LLMs会强制主导词序。

Conclusion: 位置偏见是复杂且语言相关的现象，提示工程需谨慎设计。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit positional bias -- systematic neglect of
information at specific context positions -- yet its interplay with linguistic
diversity remains poorly understood. We present a cross-linguistic study across
five typologically distinct languages (English, Russian, German, Hindi,
Vietnamese), examining how positional bias interacts with model uncertainty,
syntax, and prompting. Key findings: (1) Positional bias is model-driven, with
language-specific variations -- Qwen2.5-7B favors late positions, challenging
assumptions of early-token bias; (2) Explicit positional guidance (e.g.,
correct context is at position X) reduces accuracy across languages,
undermining prompt-engineering practices; (3) Aligning context with positional
bias increases entropy, yet minimal entropy does not predict accuracy. (4) We
further uncover that LLMs differently impose dominant word order in
free-word-order languages like Hindi.

TL;DR: 论文提出RLKD框架，通过强化学习（RL）和生成结构奖励模型（GSRM）改进对小规模语言模型的推理能力蒸馏，而非仅模仿固定路径。

Motivation: 现有监督微调（SFT）方法无法有效蒸馏教师模型的隐式多分支推理结构，影响了学生模型的推理能力提升。

Method: 采用RLKD框架，结合GSRM生成的奖励信号，通过强化学习训练学生模型以内部化教师的多分支推理结构。

Result: 实验表明，RLKD在仅使用0.1%数据的情况下，表现优于传统SFT-RL方法。

Conclusion: RLKD能够更有效地提升学生模型的推理能力，而非仅模仿固定输出路径。

Abstract: Distilling reasoning paths from teacher to student models via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) provides a shortcut for improving the reasoning ability of
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reasoning paths generated by
teacher models often reflect only surface-level traces of their underlying
authentic reasoning. Insights from cognitive neuroscience suggest that
authentic reasoning involves a complex interweaving between meta-reasoning
(which selects appropriate sub-problems from multiple candidates) and solving
(which addresses the sub-problem). This implies authentic reasoning has an
implicit multi-branch structure. Supervised fine-tuning collapses this rich
structure into a flat sequence of token prediction in the teacher's reasoning
path, preventing effective distillation of this structure to students. To
address this limitation, we propose RLKD, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based
distillation framework guided by a novel Generative Structure Reward Model
(GSRM). Our GSRM converts reasoning paths into multiple meta-reasoning-solving
steps and computes rewards to measure structural alignment between student and
teacher reasoning. RLKD combines this reward with RL, enabling student LLMs to
internalize the teacher's implicit multi-branch reasoning structure rather than
merely mimicking fixed output paths. Experiments show RLKD surpasses standard
SFT-RL pipelines even when trained on 0.1% of data under an RL-only regime,

TL;DR: 论文提出首个针对教育场景的多样基准EduBench，结合合成数据和多维度评估指标，验证了小规模模型的性能可媲美大型模型。

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在教育场景中的应用，填补现有研究的空白，优化模型的教育适应性。

Method: 构建包含9大场景、4000+教育上下文的合成数据集，设计12个关键评估维度，结合人工标注验证模型生成响应的有效性。

Result: 训练的小规模模型在测试集上表现媲美SOTA大模型（如Deepseek V3、Qwen Max）。

Conclusion: 为教育导向的语言模型开发与评估提供了实用基础。

Abstract: As large language models continue to advance, their application in
educational contexts remains underexplored and under-optimized. In this paper,
we address this gap by introducing the first diverse benchmark tailored for
educational scenarios, incorporating synthetic data containing 9 major
scenarios and over 4,000 distinct educational contexts. To enable comprehensive
assessment, we propose a set of multi-dimensional evaluation metrics that cover
12 critical aspects relevant to both teachers and students. We further apply
human annotation to ensure the effectiveness of the model-generated evaluation
responses. Additionally, we succeed to train a relatively small-scale model on
our constructed dataset and demonstrate that it can achieve performance
comparable to state-of-the-art large models (e.g., Deepseek V3, Qwen Max) on
the test set. Overall, this work provides a practical foundation for the
development and evaluation of education-oriented language models. Code and data

TL;DR: 提出KNN-SSD算法，通过KNN搜索匹配不同跳层与数据域，提高领域泛化性，实现LLM推理加速1.3x-1.6x。

Motivation: 发现自推测解码（SD）在领域偏移时性能显著下降，需提升其领域泛化性。

Method: 引入KNN-SSD算法，利用KNN搜索为不同领域输入选择最优跳层。

Result: 在多种模型和任务中实现1.3x-1.6x的推理加速。

Conclusion: KNN-SSD有效提升领域适应性，显著加速LLM推理。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a widely used paradigm to accelerate
the inference of large language models (LLMs) without compromising generation
quality. It works by efficiently drafting multiple tokens using a compact model
and then verifying them in parallel using the target LLM. Notably,
Self-Speculative Decoding proposes skipping certain layers to construct the
draft model, which eliminates the need for additional parameters or training.
Despite its strengths, we observe in this work that drafting with layer
skipping exhibits significant sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a
substantial drop in acceleration performance. To enhance the domain
generalizability of this paradigm, we introduce KNN-SSD, an algorithm that
leverages K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search to match different skipped layers
with various domain inputs. We evaluated our algorithm in various models and
multiple tasks, observing that its application leads to 1.3x-1.6x speedup in
LLM inference.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）是否能模拟人类在音位流畅性任务中的个体差异，发现尽管部分模型能匹配人类平均表现，但无法复现人类行为的变异性。

Motivation: 验证LLM是否能替代人类在认知任务中模拟个体行为差异，尤其是音位流畅性任务。

Method: 评估34种模型配置（包括提示特异性、采样温度及模型类型），并与106名人类参与者的表现对比。

Result: 部分模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）能匹配人类平均表现，但所有模型均无法复现人类变异性，且输出多样性不足。

Conclusion: LLM在模拟人类认知和行为时存在关键局限，无法完全替代人类参与者。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as substitutes for
human participants in cognitive tasks, but their ability to simulate human
behavioral variability remains unclear. This study examines whether LLMs can
approximate individual differences in the phonemic fluency task, where
participants generate words beginning with a target letter. We evaluated 34
model configurations, varying prompt specificity, sampling temperature, and
model type, and compared outputs to responses from 106 human participants.
While some configurations, especially Claude 3.7 Sonnet, matched human averages
and lexical preferences, none reproduced the scope of human variability. LLM
outputs were consistently less diverse and structurally rigid, and LLM
ensembles failed to increase diversity. Network analyses further revealed
fundamental differences in retrieval structure between humans and models. These
results highlight key limitations in using LLMs to simulate human cognition and
behavior.

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLM）在知道自己犯错时是否会承认错误？本文定义‘撤回’行为，探究LLM何时及为何撤回答案。研究发现LLM虽有撤回能力但频率低，且撤回与模型内部信念相关。简单的监督微调显著提升了撤回表现。

Motivation: 探究大语言模型是否会承认错误并撤回错误答案，理解其撤回行为何时发生及其背后的原因。

Method: 构建模型特定数据集评估撤回行为，分析其与内部信念的关系，并通过引导实验验证因果关系。

Result: LLM撤回错误答案的频率低，撤回行为与内部信念紧密相关；监督微调能显著改善模型撤回表现。

Conclusion: LLM的撤回行为受其内部信念影响，通过监督微调可提升其准确撤回错误答案的能力。

Abstract: Can large language models (LLMs) admit their mistakes when they should know
better? In this work, we define the behavior of acknowledging errors in
previously generated answers as "retraction" and aim to understand when and why
LLMs choose to retract. We first construct model-specific datasets to evaluate
whether a model will retract an incorrect answer that contradicts its own
parametric knowledge. While LLMs are capable of retraction, they do so only
infrequently. We demonstrate that retraction is closely tied to previously
identified indicators of models' internal belief: models fail to retract wrong
answers that they "believe" to be factually correct. Steering experiments
further demonstrate that internal belief causally influences model retraction.
In particular, when the model does not believe its answer, this not only
encourages the model to attempt to verify the answer, but also alters attention
behavior during self-verification. Finally, we demonstrate that simple
supervised fine-tuning significantly improves retraction performance by helping
the model learn more accurate internal beliefs. Code and datasets are available

TL;DR: 生成式AI简化健康信息时会遗漏关键内容，研究比较了五种方法补充遗漏信息，发现补充所有遗漏实体效果最好。

Motivation: 简化健康信息时，生成式AI可能会遗漏重要内容，影响理解，因此需要研究如何有效补充这些遗漏信息。

Method: 收集50份健康信息文本，用gpt-4-0613简化，比较五种补充遗漏实体或词汇的方法，并通过语义相似度和ROUGE评分评估。

Result: 补充所有遗漏实体效果最佳，优于补充排名靠前的实体或随机内容。

Conclusion: 现有工具能识别遗漏实体，但无法有效排序，补充所有遗漏实体是最优策略。

Abstract: Understanding health information is essential in achieving and maintaining a
healthy life. We focus on simplifying health information for better
understanding. With the availability of generative AI, the simplification
process has become efficient and of reasonable quality, however, the algorithms
remove information that may be crucial for comprehension. In this study, we
compare generative AI to detect missing information in simplified text,
evaluate its importance, and fix the text with the missing information. We
collected 50 health information texts and simplified them using gpt-4-0613. We
compare five approaches to identify missing elements and regenerate the text by
inserting the missing elements. These five approaches involve adding missing
entities and missing words in various ways: 1) adding all the missing entities,
2) adding all missing words, 3) adding the top-3 entities ranked by gpt-4-0613,
and 4, 5) serving as controls for comparison, adding randomly chosen entities.
We use cosine similarity and ROUGE scores to evaluate the semantic similarity
and content overlap between the original, simplified, and reconstructed
simplified text. We do this for both summaries and full text. Overall, we find
that adding missing entities improves the text. Adding all the missing entities
resulted in better text regeneration, which was better than adding the
top-ranked entities or words, or random words. Current tools can identify these
entities, but are not valuable in ranking them.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言模型在事实召回任务中的表现，对比了两阶段训练和混合训练的效果，发现混合训练能促进共享参数的形成，提升模型的事实召回能力。

Motivation: 尽管语言模型在通用任务上表现优异，但在事实召回任务中仍面临挑战。现有的两阶段训练往往导致死记硬背而非通用召回，而混合训练虽然效果更好，但其机制尚不明确。

Method: 研究通过交叉任务梯度追踪分析共享参数，比较两阶段训练和混合训练对模型参数的影响，使用了Llama-3.2B和Pythia-2.8B模型在合成数据集上进行实验。

Result: 混合训练促进了更大且更集中的共享参数的形成，这些参数可能是模型能跨任务形式泛化事实知识的关键。

Conclusion: 共享参数的形成可能是语言模型在事实召回任务中表现更好的原因，混合训练更有效地支持了这一点。

Abstract: Fact recall, the ability of language models (LMs) to retrieve specific
factual knowledge, remains a challenging task despite their impressive general
capabilities. Common training strategies often struggle to promote robust
recall behavior with two-stage training, which first trains a model with
fact-storing examples (e.g., factual statements) and then with fact-recalling
examples (question-answer pairs), tending to encourage rote memorization rather
than generalizable fact retrieval. In contrast, mixed training, which jointly
uses both types of examples, has been empirically shown to improve the ability
to recall facts, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In
this work, we investigate how these training strategies affect how model
parameters are shaped during training and how these differences relate to their
ability to recall facts. We introduce cross-task gradient trace to identify
shared parameters, those strongly influenced by both fact-storing and
fact-recalling examples. Our analysis on synthetic fact recall datasets with
the Llama-3.2B and Pythia-2.8B models reveals that mixed training encouraging a
larger and more centralized set of shared parameters. These findings suggest
that the emergence of parameters may play a key role in enabling LMs to
generalize factual knowledge across task formulations.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在开放生成场景中的行为控制仍具挑战性，需要更可靠的方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）获取稀疏潜在表示，训练线性分类器识别任务相关维度，学习约束在子空间中的引导向量。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在情感、真实性和政治极性任务中成功率高，生成质量下降最小，且只需小子空间即可有效引导。

Conclusion: 稀疏表示空间的监督引导方法为LLM行为控制提供了更精准和可解释的干预手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
natural language understanding and generation, but controlling their behavior
reliably remains challenging, especially in open-ended generation settings.
This paper introduces a novel supervised steering approach that operates in
sparse, interpretable representation spaces. We employ sparse autoencoders
(SAEs)to obtain sparse latent representations that aim to disentangle semantic
attributes from model activations. Then we train linear classifiers to identify
a small subspace of task-relevant dimensions in latent representations.
Finally, we learn supervised steering vectors constrained to this subspace,
optimized to align with target behaviors. Experiments across sentiment,
truthfulness, and politics polarity steering tasks with multiple LLMs
demonstrate that our supervised steering vectors achieve higher success rates
with minimal degradation in generation quality compared to existing methods.
Further analysis reveals that a notably small subspace is sufficient for
effective steering, enabling more targeted and interpretable interventions.

Motivation: 探索情感、身体化与语言的关系，填补大样本自然语言数据中这一研究的空白。

Method: 构建在线英文文本（博客和推文）中BPMs的语料库，包括人工标注情感的子集，结合情感词典分析BPMs的情感强度。

Result: BPMs在个人叙事和推文中常见（5%~10%），情感更强，且与较差健康结果显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究BPMs为NLP、情感科学和人类福祉的交叉研究开辟新方向。

Abstract: This paper is the first investigation of the connection between emotion,
embodiment, and everyday language in a large sample of natural language data.
We created corpora of body part mentions (BPMs) in online English text (blog
posts and tweets). This includes a subset featuring human annotations for the
emotions of the person whose body part is mentioned in the text. We show that
BPMs are common in personal narratives and tweets (~5% to 10% of posts include
BPMs) and that their usage patterns vary markedly by time and %geographic
location. Using word-emotion association lexicons and our annotated data, we
show that text containing BPMs tends to be more emotionally charged, even when
the BPM is not explicitly used to describe a physical reaction to the emotion
in the text. Finally, we discover a strong and statistically significant
correlation between body-related language and a variety of poorer health
outcomes. In sum, we argue that investigating the role of body-part related
words in language can open up valuable avenues of future research at the
intersection of NLP, the affective sciences, and the study of human wellbeing.

Motivation: 多模态情感分析（MSA）是通用人工智能的重要挑战，但零样本范式在MSA上表现不佳，研究目标是通过ICL验证MLLMs的情感感知能力。

Conclusion: MLLMs具备情感感知能力，通过优化演示配置可显著提升其性能，为多模态任务提供新思路。

Abstract: The advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
various multimodal tasks to be addressed under a zero-shot paradigm. This
paradigm sidesteps the cost of model fine-tuning, emerging as a dominant trend
in practical application. Nevertheless, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), a
pivotal challenge in the quest for general artificial intelligence, fails to
accommodate this convenience. The zero-shot paradigm exhibits undesirable
performance on MSA, casting doubt on whether MLLMs can perceive sentiments as
competent as supervised models. By extending the zero-shot paradigm to
In-Context Learning (ICL) and conducting an in-depth study on configuring
demonstrations, we validate that MLLMs indeed possess such capability.
Specifically, three key factors that cover demonstrations' retrieval,
presentation, and distribution are comprehensively investigated and optimized.
A sentimental predictive bias inherent in MLLMs is also discovered and later
effectively counteracted. By complementing each other, the devised strategies
for three factors result in average accuracy improvements of 15.9% on six MSA
datasets against the zero-shot paradigm and 11.2% against the random ICL
baseline.

Result: LLMs能有效纠正零样本和CTC微调ASR的结果，但对结合上下文信息的自回归模型（如Whisper）效果不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童ASR中有一定潜力，但在复杂情境下仍需改进。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has recently shown remarkable progress,
but accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge.
Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
improving ASR transcriptions. However, their applications in child speech
including conversational scenarios are underexplored. In this study, we explore
the use of LLMs in correcting ASR errors for conversational child speech. We
demonstrate the promises and challenges of LLMs through experiments on two
children's conversational speech datasets with both zero-shot and fine-tuned
ASR outputs. We find that while LLMs are helpful in correcting zero-shot ASR
outputs and fine-tuned CTC-based ASR outputs, it remains challenging for LLMs
to improve ASR performance when incorporating contextual information or when
using fine-tuned autoregressive ASR (e.g., Whisper) outputs.

Conclusion: LLMs的习语理解是内部知识检索和基于推理的推断之间的相互作用的结果。

Abstract: Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties,
which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have
leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks,
e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation,
little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs,
particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new
large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its
corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that
influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on
memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues
and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies
that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal
knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.

Result: 发现所有测试的LLM评估者均存在正负偏见，导致评分不公。即使生成测试用例后仍存在偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要更稳健的代码评估方法。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models(LLMs) as evaluators, their
application has expanded to code evaluation tasks, where they assess the
correctness of generated code without relying on reference implementations.
While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical,
unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically
equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often
exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or
formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges
can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first
comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code
evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five
programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all
tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases,
resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM
judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test
cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation
methods.

Abstract: Personalizing jargon detection and explanation is essential for making
technical documents accessible to readers with diverse disciplinary
backgrounds. However, tailoring models to individual users typically requires
substantial annotation efforts and computational resources due to user-specific
finetuning. To address this, we present a systematic study of personalized
jargon detection, focusing on methods that are both efficient and scalable for
real-world deployment. We explore two personalization strategies: (1)
lightweight fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on open-source models,
and (2) personalized prompting, which tailors model behavior at inference time
without retaining. To reflect realistic constraints, we also investigate hybrid
approaches that combine limited annotated data with unsupervised user
background signals. Our personalized LoRA model outperforms GPT-4 by 21.4% in
F1 score and exceeds the best performing oracle baseline by 8.3%. Remarkably,
our method achieves comparable performance using only 10% of the annotated
training data, demonstrating its practicality for resource-constrained
settings. Our study offers the first work to systematically explore efficient,
low-resource personalization of jargon detection using open-source language
models, offering a practical path toward scalable, user-adaptive NLP system.

Abstract: An objective, face-valid way to assess the originality of creative ideas is
to measure how rare each idea is within a population -- an approach long used
in creativity research but difficult to automate at scale. Tabulating response
frequencies via manual bucketing of idea rephrasings is labor-intensive,
error-prone, and brittle under large corpora. We introduce a fully automated,
psychometrically validated pipeline for frequency-based originality scoring.
Our method, MuseRAG, combines large language models (LLMs) with an externally
orchestrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Given a new idea,
the system retrieves semantically similar prior idea buckets and zero-shot
prompts the LLM to judge whether the new idea belongs to an existing bucket or
forms a new one. The resulting buckets enable computation of frequency-based
originality metrics. Across five datasets (N=1143, n_ideas=16294), MuseRAG
matches human annotators in idea clustering structure and resolution (AMI =
0.59) and in participant-level scoring (r = 0.89) -- while exhibiting strong
convergent and external validity. Our work enables intent-sensitive,
human-aligned originality scoring at scale to aid creativity research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with following explicit length instructions, prompting the creation of LIFEBench to evaluate this ability across diverse tasks and lengths. Findings show most models perform poorly beyond a certain length threshold, even long-context LLMs.

Motivation: To address LLMs' limitations in adhering to length instructions, a gap overlooked by existing benchmarks.

Method: Introduced LIFEBench with 10,800 instances across 4 tasks in English and Chinese, testing lengths from 16 to 8192 words, and evaluated 26 LLMs.

Result: Most models fail beyond short lengths, and even long-context LLMs don’t improve performance. Reasoning LLMs excel.

Conclusion: LIFEBench highlights fundamental LLM limitations in following length instructions, guiding future improvements.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems
over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task:
following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel.
Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate
prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on
evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet
length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following
Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to
follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified
lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in
both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192
words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably
follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain
threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed
maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations
extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended
input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions
following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall,
LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions
following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Align-GRAG是一种基于图的新型检索增强生成框架，通过双对齐优化解决了图RAG中的无关节点和表示差距问题。

Motivation: 解决大语言模型（LLM）在幻觉和过时信息上的局限性，并通过图结构增强检索与生成的结合。

Method: 提出Align-GRAG，采用推理引导的双对齐框架，结合KL散度和对比损失优化图编码器与LLM生成的推理总结。

Result: 在GraphQA基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，适用于常识推理、场景图理解和知识图谱推理任务。

Conclusion: Align-GRAG通过双对齐优化提升了图RAG的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but
still struggle with issues like hallucinations and outdated information.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM
outputs in external knowledge with an Information Retrieval (IR) system.
Building on this foundation, graph-based RAG systems go a step further by
retrieving subgraphs, which preserve the relationships between knowledge
entities and provide more comprehensive context. However, graph RAG faces two
challenges: (1) Retrieving relevant information introduces irrelevant nodes
(especially in dense graph databases, where retrieval usually extends to
adjacent nodes), and leads to overly lengthy inputs that hinder efficiency; (2)
The representation gap between graph and language during generation with LLMs
limits the ability to fully leverage graph structures for enhanced
understanding. To address these limitations, we propose Align-GRAG, a novel
reasoning-guided dual alignment framework in post-retrieval phrase. It first
formulates a subgraph by retrieving nodes and edges. Then an Aligner is
proposed to jointly optimizes a graph encoder with LLM-summarized reasoning. It
achieves dual alignment of graph node and representation by leveraging KL
divergence loss and contrastive loss, facilitating efficient pruning of
irrelevant knowledge and establishing a unified semantic space. The Generator
integrates the aligned graph data with LLM to produce coherent and accurate
answers. Experiments on GraphQA benchmark across three tasks (including common
sense reasoning, scene graph understanding, and knowledge graph reasoning)
validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be available upon
accepted.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEAL的新型越狱攻击方法，针对大型推理模型（LRMs），通过自适应加密管道覆盖其推理过程，成功绕过安全机制。

Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型（LRMs）表现出强大的逻辑能力，但其更强的推理能力可能引入更严重的安全漏洞，目前研究较少。

Method: SEAL采用堆叠加密方法，结合多种密码来覆盖模型的推理能力，并通过动态策略调整密码长度、顺序和组合以防止模型开发对策。

Result: 在包括DeepSeek-R1、Claude Sonnet和OpenAI GPT-o4在内的真实推理模型上进行了广泛实验，SEAL在GPT o4-mini上的攻击成功率达到80.8%，显著优于现有基线方法27.2%。

Conclusion: SEAL作为一种新型越狱攻击方法，有效地绕过LRMs的安全机制，展示了LRMs在安全性方面的潜在风险。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated superior logical
capabilities compared to traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining
significant attention. Despite their impressive performance, the potential for
stronger reasoning abilities to introduce more severe security vulnerabilities
remains largely underexplored. Existing jailbreak methods often struggle to
balance effectiveness with robustness against adaptive safety mechanisms. In
this work, we propose SEAL, a novel jailbreak attack that targets LRMs through
an adaptive encryption pipeline designed to override their reasoning processes
and evade potential adaptive alignment. Specifically, SEAL introduces a stacked
encryption approach that combines multiple ciphers to overwhelm the models
reasoning capabilities, effectively bypassing built-in safety mechanisms. To
further prevent LRMs from developing countermeasures, we incorporate two
dynamic strategies - random and adaptive - that adjust the cipher length,
order, and combination. Extensive experiments on real-world reasoning models,
including DeepSeek-R1, Claude Sonnet, and OpenAI GPT-o4, validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Notably, SEAL achieves an attack success rate of
80.8% on GPT o4-mini, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a significant
margin of 27.2%. Warning: This paper contains examples of inappropriate,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Diverse-NS框架，通过控制长度偏见的自学习方式，提高语言模型的多样性和表现力。

Motivation: 现有多样性指标和奖励模型偏好短输出，限制了语言模型的表达多样性。

Method: Diverse-NS是一种长度控制的自学习框架，通过生成和筛选偏好数据平衡多样性、质量和长度。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Olmo-2系列模型上，Diverse-NS显著提升了词汇和语义多样性，且对小模型作为“多样性教师”的潜力进行了验证。

Conclusion: 通过明确解决长度偏见，Diverse-NS高效地推动了模型生成更多样化和富有表现力的输出。

Abstract: Diverse language model responses are crucial for creative generation,
open-ended tasks, and self-improvement training. We show that common diversity
metrics, and even reward models used for preference optimization,
systematically bias models toward shorter outputs, limiting expressiveness. To
address this, we introduce Diverse, not Short (Diverse-NS), a length-controlled
self-learning framework that improves response diversity while maintaining
length parity. By generating and filtering preference data that balances
diversity, quality, and length, Diverse-NS enables effective training using
only 3,000 preference pairs. Applied to LLaMA-3.1-8B and the Olmo-2 family,
Diverse-NS substantially enhances lexical and semantic diversity. We show
consistent improvement in diversity with minor reduction or gains in response
quality on four creative generation tasks: Divergent Associations, Persona
Generation, Alternate Uses, and Creative Writing. Surprisingly, experiments
with the Olmo-2 model family (7B, and 13B) show that smaller models like
Olmo-2-7B can serve as effective "diversity teachers" for larger models. By
explicitly addressing length bias, our method efficiently pushes models toward
more diverse and expressive outputs.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型中知识遗忘（unlearning）的问题，尤其是局部化遗忘方法的有效性，发现参数局部性与知识遗忘效果之间没有必然联系。

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中知识遗忘的挑战，特别是局部化遗忘方法的有效性不足问题。

Method: 通过回顾现有局部化遗忘方法并进行控制实验，评估参数修改对知识遗忘的因果影响。

Result: 发现有效遗忘所需的参数修改并不严格受局部性限制，挑战了局部化遗忘的核心假设。

Conclusion: 局部化遗忘方法的假设不成立，需重新思考知识遗忘的参数修改策略。

Abstract: Large language models often retain unintended content, prompting growing
interest in knowledge unlearning. Recent approaches emphasize localized
unlearning, which restricts parameter updates to specific regions in an effort
to remove target knowledge while preserving unrelated general knowledge.
However, their effectiveness remains uncertain due to the lack of robust and
thorough evaluation of the trade-off between the competing goals of unlearning.
In this paper, we begin by revisiting existing localized unlearning approaches.
We then conduct controlled experiments to rigorously evaluate whether local
parameter updates causally contribute to unlearning. Our findings reveal that
the set of parameters that must be modified for effective unlearning is not
strictly determined, challenging the core assumption of localized unlearning
that parameter locality is inherently indicative of effective knowledge
removal.

state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection across
different baselines. This demonstrates the need for incorporating linguistic

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Transformer Copilot框架，通过记录错误日志（Mistake Log）并设计Copilot模型优化下游任务的生成性能。

Motivation: 传统微调仅最小化生成损失，忽略了模型自身的学习信号。论文借鉴人类反思错误的学习方式，提出系统性改进方法。

Method: 引入Mistake Log跟踪错误；设计Copilot模型通过logits修正Pilot模型的推理；提出联合训练与融合推理范式。

Result: 在12个基准测试中，性能提升高达34.5%，计算开销低，且具有可扩展性和迁移性。

Conclusion: Transformer Copilot框架通过错误学习和联合优化显著提升模型性能，为下游任务微调提供新思路。

Abstract: Large language models are typically adapted to downstream tasks through
supervised fine-tuning on domain-specific data. While standard fine-tuning
focuses on minimizing generation loss to optimize model parameters, we take a
deeper step by retaining and leveraging the model's own learning signals,
analogous to how human learners reflect on past mistakes to improve future
performance. We first introduce the concept of Mistake Log to systematically
track the model's learning behavior and recurring errors throughout
fine-tuning. Treating the original transformer-based model as the Pilot, we
correspondingly design a Copilot model to refine the Pilot's inference
performance via logits rectification. We name the overall Pilot-Copilot
framework the Transformer Copilot, which introduces (i) a novel Copilot model
design, (ii) a joint training paradigm where the Copilot continuously learns
from the evolving Mistake Log alongside the Pilot, and (iii) a fused inference
paradigm where the Copilot rectifies the Pilot's logits for enhanced
generation. We provide both theoretical and empirical analyses on our new
learning framework. Experiments on 12 benchmarks spanning commonsense,
arithmetic, and recommendation tasks demonstrate that Transformer Copilot
consistently improves performance by up to 34.5%, while introducing marginal
computational overhead to Pilot models and exhibiting strong scalability and
transferability.

Conclusion: 结论认为高质量语音语料库可作为评估大型语言模型的有力基准，有助于进一步理解模型的认知特性。

Abstract: The achievements of Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing,
especially for high-resource languages, call for a better understanding of
their characteristics from a cognitive perspective. Researchers have attempted
to evaluate artificial models by testing their ability to predict behavioral
(e.g., eye-tracking fixations) and physiological (e.g., brain responses)
variables during language processing (e.g., reading/listening). In this paper,
we propose using spontaneous speech corpora to derive production variables
(speech reductions, prosodic prominences) and applying them in a similar
fashion. More precisely, we extract. We then test models trained with a
standard procedure on different pretraining datasets (written, spoken, and
mixed genres) for their ability to predict these two variables. Our results
show that, after some fine-tuning, the models can predict these production
variables well above baselines. We also observe that spoken genre training data
provides more accurate predictions than written genres. These results
contribute to the broader effort of using high-quality speech corpora as
benchmarks for LLMs.

Result: 在多个数据集中表现优于基线，错误定位F1分数提升89%。

Conclusion: HiMATE显著提升机器翻译评估的细粒度分析能力。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables flexible and
interpretable automatic evaluations. In the field of machine translation
evaluation, utilizing LLMs with translation error annotations based on
Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) yields more human-aligned judgments.
However, current LLM-based evaluation methods still face challenges in
accurately identifying error spans and assessing their severity. In this paper,
we propose HiMATE, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Machine Translation
Evaluation. We argue that existing approaches inadequately exploit the
fine-grained structural and semantic information within the MQM hierarchy. To
address this, we develop a hierarchical multi-agent system grounded in the MQM
error typology, enabling granular evaluation of subtype errors. Two key
strategies are incorporated to further mitigate systemic hallucinations within
the framework: the utilization of the model's self-reflection capability and
the facilitation of agent discussion involving asymmetric information.
Empirically, HiMATE outperforms competitive baselines across different datasets
in conducting human-aligned evaluations. Further analyses underscore its
significant advantage in error span detection and severity assessment,
achieving an average F1-score improvement of 89% over the best-performing
baseline. We make our code and data publicly available at

Motivation: 多跳问答中，迭代RAG面临长上下文和无关信息积累的问题，影响了模型处理和推理检索内容的能力。

Method: 通过在每一步从检索到的文档中生成简洁且相关的笔记（Notes Writing），减少噪声并保留关键信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在四个评估数据集上平均提高了15.6个百分点的性能，且输出标记增加极少。

Conclusion: 笔记写作是一种框架无关的方法，能够显著提升迭代RAG的性能并间接增加大型语言模型的有效上下文长度。

Abstract: Iterative RAG for multi-hop question answering faces challenges with lengthy
contexts and the buildup of irrelevant information. This hinders a model's
capacity to process and reason over retrieved content and limits performance.
While recent methods focus on compressing retrieved information, they are
either restricted to single-round RAG, require finetuning or lack scalability
in iterative RAG. To address these challenges, we propose Notes Writing, a
method that generates concise and relevant notes from retrieved documents at
each step, thereby reducing noise and retaining only essential information.
This indirectly increases the effective context length of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling them to reason and plan more effectively while processing
larger volumes of input text. Notes Writing is framework agnostic and can be
integrated with different iterative RAG methods. We demonstrate its
effectiveness with three iterative RAG methods, across two models and four
evaluation datasets. Notes writing yields an average improvement of 15.6
percentage points overall, with minimal increase in output tokens.

Motivation: 大规模语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限的部署中因高延迟和能耗而不实用，而现有的知识蒸馏方法忽视了token级预测差异。

Method: 提出Token-wise Distillation（ToDi），通过sigmoid加权函数动态结合FKL和RKL，实现token级的预测对齐。

Result: ToDi在指令遵循基准测试中优于现有基线方法，并通过消融实验和效率分析验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: ToDi通过动态调整FKL和RKL的组合，实现了更精确的知识蒸馏，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer impressive performance but are impractical
for resource-constrained deployment due to high latency and energy consumption.
Knowledge distillation (KD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from a
large teacher to a smaller student model. However, conventional KD, notably
approaches like Forward KL (FKL) and Reverse KL (RKL), apply uniform divergence
loss across the entire vocabulary, neglecting token-level prediction
discrepancies. By investigating these representative divergences via gradient
analysis, we reveal that FKL boosts underestimated tokens, while RKL suppresses
overestimated ones, showing their complementary roles. Based on this
observation, we propose Token-wise Distillation (ToDi), a novel method that
adaptively combines FKL and RKL per token using a sigmoid-based weighting
function derived from the teacher-student probability log-ratio. ToDi
dynamically emphasizes the appropriate divergence for each token, enabling
precise distribution alignment. We demonstrate that ToDi consistently
outperforms recent distillation baselines using uniform or less granular
strategies across instruction-following benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies
and efficiency analysis further validate ToDi's effectiveness and practicality.

However, current routing approaches often face limitations in scalability when

its effectiveness and generalizability in group-level routing using modern

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法依赖高成本输出生成或人工标注，难以扩展，尤其是在小型或未指令调优模型上。

Method: PMPO通过掩码分析低质量提示段，最小化交叉熵损失优化提示，仅需前向传播和似然计算。

Result: PMPO在多个任务和模型上表现优异，包括BBH、GSM8K和AlpacaEval 2.0，平均准确率和胜率显著提升。

Conclusion: PMPO以高效、轻量的方式实现广泛适用的提示优化，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Prompt optimization offers a practical and broadly applicable alternative to
fine-tuning for improving large language model (LLM) performance. However,
existing methods often rely on costly output generation, self-critiquing
abilities, or human-annotated preferences, which limit their scalability,
especially for smaller or non-instruction-tuned models. We introduce PMPO
(Probabilistic Metric Prompt Optimization), a unified framework that refines
prompts using token-level cross-entropy loss as a direct, lightweight
evaluation signal. PMPO identifies low-quality prompt segments by masking and
measuring their impact on loss, then rewrites and selects improved variants by
minimizing loss over positive and negative examples. Unlike prior methods, it
requires no output sampling or human evaluation during optimization, relying
only on forward passes and log-likelihoods. PMPO supports both supervised and
preference-based tasks through a closely aligned loss-based evaluation
strategy. Experiments show that PMPO consistently outperforms prior methods
across model sizes and tasks: it achieves the highest average accuracy on BBH,
performs strongly on GSM8K and AQUA-RAT, and improves AlpacaEval 2.0 win rates
by over 19 points. These results highlight PMPO's effectiveness, efficiency,
and broad applicability.

Abstract: Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture
nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology
reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded
tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for
Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report
can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also
assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition
across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive
location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's
multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and
clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure
the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified
radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from
MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions.
Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical
attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with
clinical judgment.

Abstract: Novelty is a core component of academic papers, and there are multiple
perspectives on the assessment of novelty. Existing methods often focus on word
or entity combinations, which provide limited insights. The content related to
a paper's novelty is typically distributed across different core sections,
e.g., Introduction, Methodology and Results. Therefore, exploring the optimal
combination of sections for evaluating the novelty of a paper is important for
advancing automated novelty assessment. In this paper, we utilize different
combinations of sections from academic papers as inputs to drive language
models to predict novelty scores. We then analyze the results to determine the
optimal section combinations for novelty score prediction. We first employ
natural language processing techniques to identify the sectional structure of
academic papers, categorizing them into introduction, methods, results, and
discussion (IMRaD). Subsequently, we used different combinations of these
sections (e.g., introduction and methods) as inputs for pretrained language
models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs), employing novelty scores
provided by human expert reviewers as ground truth labels to obtain prediction
results. The results indicate that using introduction, results and discussion
is most appropriate for assessing the novelty of a paper, while the use of the
entire text does not yield significant results. Furthermore, based on the
results of the PLMs and LLMs, the introduction and results appear to be the
most important section for the task of novelty score prediction. The code and
dataset for this paper can be accessed at

Result: 实验表明，包括GPT-4o在内的前沿模型在需参考多记忆时表现显著下降（30.5%），尤其在涉及用户模式的任务中。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型在记忆利用上的局限性，为未来开发更有效的个性化具身代理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Embodied agents empowered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in household object rearrangement tasks. However, these tasks
primarily focus on single-turn interactions with simplified instructions, which
do not truly reflect the challenges of providing meaningful assistance to
users. To provide personalized assistance, embodied agents must understand the
unique semantics that users assign to the physical world (e.g., favorite cup,
breakfast routine) by leveraging prior interaction history to interpret
dynamic, real-world instructions. Yet, the effectiveness of embodied agents in
utilizing memory for personalized assistance remains largely underexplored. To
address this gap, we present MEMENTO, a personalized embodied agent evaluation
framework designed to comprehensively assess memory utilization capabilities to
provide personalized assistance. Our framework consists of a two-stage memory
evaluation process design that enables quantifying the impact of memory
utilization on task performance. This process enables the evaluation of agents'
understanding of personalized knowledge in object rearrangement tasks by
focusing on its role in goal interpretation: (1) the ability to identify target
objects based on personal meaning (object semantics), and (2) the ability to
infer object-location configurations from consistent user patterns, such as
routines (user patterns). Our experiments across various LLMs reveal
significant limitations in memory utilization, with even frontier models like
GPT-4o experiencing a 30.5% performance drop when required to reference
multiple memories, particularly in tasks involving user patterns. These
findings, along with our detailed analyses and case studies, provide valuable
insights for future research in developing more effective personalized embodied
agents. Project website: https://connoriginal.github.io/MEMENTO

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PaTH提出了一种基于Householder变换的数据依赖性位置编码方案，替代RoPE，提升了Transformer的表达能力。

Motivation: RoPE的位置编码仅依赖相对位置而忽略输入数据，限制了其表达性，因此需要一种更灵活的方案。

Method: PaTH基于数据依赖的Householder变换，设计了高效的并行训练算法与FlashAttention风格的分块实现。

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际语言建模任务中，PaTH表现优于RoPE及其他基线方法。

Conclusion: PaTH通过数据依赖性位置编码显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core primitive in modern large language models
(LLMs) and AI more broadly. Since attention by itself is permutation-invariant,
position encoding is essential for modeling structured domains such as
language. Rotary position encoding (RoPE) has emerged as the de facto standard
approach for position encoding and is part of many modern LLMs. However, in
RoPE the key/query transformation between two elements in a sequence is only a
function of their relative position and otherwise independent of the actual
input. This limits the expressivity of RoPE-based transformers.
  This paper describes PaTH, a flexible data-dependent position encoding scheme
based on accumulated products of Householder(like) transformations, where each
transformation is data-dependent, i.e., a function of the input. We derive an
efficient parallel algorithm for training through exploiting a compact
representation of products of Householder matrices, and implement a
FlashAttention-style blockwise algorithm that minimizes I/O cost. Across both
targeted synthetic benchmarks and moderate-scale real-world language modeling
experiments, we find that PaTH demonstrates superior performance compared to
RoPE and other recent baselines.

Result: 验证了语义枢纽感知的预训练数据集能有效提升LLMs的跨语言能力。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的可解释性提供了新见解，并提出了一种改进跨语言能力的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability in cross-lingual
tasks. Understanding how LLMs acquire this ability is crucial for their
interpretability. To quantify the cross-lingual ability of LLMs accurately, we
propose a Word-Level Cross-Lingual Translation Task. To find how LLMs learn
cross-lingual ability, we trace the outputs of LLMs' intermediate layers in the
word translation task. We identify and distinguish two distinct behaviors in
the forward pass of LLMs: co-occurrence behavior and semantic pivot behavior.
We attribute LLMs' two distinct behaviors to the co-occurrence frequency of
words and find the semantic pivot from the pre-training dataset. Finally, to
apply our findings to improve the cross-lingual ability of LLMs, we reconstruct
a semantic pivot-aware pre-training dataset using documents with a high
proportion of semantic pivots. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach in enhancing cross-lingual ability. Our research contributes
insights into the interpretability of LLMs and offers a method for improving
LLMs' cross-lingual ability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于问题解决逻辑的课程ICL策略，通过分析和排序示例，显著提升了LLMs的复杂推理能力。

Motivation: 传统方法依赖简单特征衡量示例相关性，但不足以反映示例间的内在联系，因此提出新的策略。

Method: 构建问题解决逻辑指令集，微调语言模型分析示例逻辑，按难度排序示例。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能和效率上优于先前ICL方法，有效提升LLMs推理能力。

Conclusion: 基于问题解决逻辑的课程ICL策略是提升LLMs复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) can significantly enhance the complex reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), with the key lying in the
selection and ordering of demonstration examples. Previous methods typically
relied on simple features to measure the relevance between examples. We argue
that these features are not sufficient to reflect the intrinsic connections
between examples. In this study, we propose a curriculum ICL strategy guided by
problem-solving logic. We select demonstration examples by analyzing the
problem-solving logic and order them based on curriculum learning.
Specifically, we constructed a problem-solving logic instruction set based on
the BREAK dataset and fine-tuned a language model to analyze the
problem-solving logic of examples. Subsequently, we selected appropriate
demonstration examples based on problem-solving logic and assessed their
difficulty according to the number of problem-solving steps. In accordance with
the principles of curriculum learning, we ordered the examples from easy to
hard to serve as contextual prompts. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks indicate that our method outperforms previous ICL approaches in
terms of performance and efficiency, effectively enhancing the complex
reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our project will be publicly available
subsequently.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文针对自动文本简化（ATS）的评估方法不足，特别是现有指标无法有效检测错误的问题，提出了一个错误分类系统，并引入了一个带有人工标注的并行数据集，用于改进ATS模型的评估和开发。

Motivation: 公众常因复杂文本难以理解而传播错误信息。ATS虽能提高信息可及性，但其评估方法未跟上文本生成（如LLMs）的进步，且现有指标与错误检测不相关，需改进评估框架。

Method: 论文提出错误分类法（重点关注信息失真），并构建一个并行数据集（自动简化科学文本+人工标注）。随后分析数据质量，并评估现有模型在该分类法下的表现。

Result: 论文贡献包括错误分类法、标注数据集及模型表现分析，为研究者提供了改进ATS评估和开发可靠模型的工具。

Conclusion: 通过引入系统化错误分类和标注数据集，论文填补了ATS评估空白，有助于提升自动简化文本的质量。

Abstract: The general public often encounters complex texts but does not have the time
or expertise to fully understand them, leading to the spread of misinformation.
Automatic Text Simplification (ATS) helps make information more accessible, but
its evaluation methods have not kept up with advances in text generation,
especially with Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent studies
have shown that current ATS metrics do not correlate with the presence of
errors. Manual inspections have further revealed a variety of errors,
underscoring the need for a more nuanced evaluation framework, which is
currently lacking. This resource paper addresses this gap by introducing a test
collection for detecting and classifying errors in simplified texts. First, we
propose a taxonomy of errors, with a formal focus on information distortion.
Next, we introduce a parallel dataset of automatically simplified scientific
texts. This dataset has been human-annotated with labels based on our proposed
taxonomy. Finally, we analyze the quality of the dataset, and we study the
performance of existing models to detect and classify errors from that
taxonomy. These contributions give researchers the tools to better evaluate
errors in ATS, develop more reliable models, and ultimately improve the quality
of automatically simplified texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ULTRAEDIT的新型模型编辑方法，旨在实现高效、大规模的语言模型终身学习。该方法通过轻量级线性代数运算实现快速参数修改，显著提升了编辑速度和资源效率。

Motivation: 现有的模型编辑方法在大规模终身学习中效率不足，难以应对实际应用中的需求。因此，需要一种更高效、适应性强的编辑解决方案。

Method: ULTRAEDIT是一种无需训练、无需特定主题和无记忆的编辑方法，通过轻量级线性代数运算计算参数偏移，实现快速一致的参数修改，并结合终身归一化策略适应分布变化。

Result: ULTRAEDIT的编辑速度比现有最快方法快7倍以上，同时VRAM消耗不到1/3，能够在大规模数据集（2M编辑对）上支持高达1M的编辑操作，并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT是一种高效、适应性强且资源友好的模型编辑方法，适用于大规模终身学习场景。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

TL;DR: 研究发现，标准的特征归因方法在语音领域普遍不可靠，但基于单词对齐的扰动方法在单词分类任务中表现例外。

Motivation: 随着大规模预训练模型能力的提升，理解其输出决定因素变得愈发重要。特征归因旨在揭示输入元素的哪些部分对模型输出贡献最大。然而，语音输入信号的独特性使得特征归因方法的应用具有挑战性。

Method: 研究了输入类型、聚合和扰动时间跨度等因素如何影响标准特征归因方法的可靠性，以及这些因素与每个分类任务特征的交互作用。

Result: 发现标准特征归因方法在语音领域普遍不可靠，但基于单词对齐的扰动方法在单词分类任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: 语音处理中需要专门设计特征归因方法，尤其是在单词分类任务中，基于单词对齐的扰动方法可能是更可靠的选择。

Abstract: As the capabilities of large-scale pre-trained models evolve, understanding
the determinants of their outputs becomes more important. Feature attribution
aims to reveal which parts of the input elements contribute the most to model
outputs. In speech processing, the unique characteristics of the input signal
make the application of feature attribution methods challenging. We study how
factors such as input type and aggregation and perturbation timespan impact the
reliability of standard feature attribution methods, and how these factors
interact with characteristics of each classification task. We find that
standard approaches to feature attribution are generally unreliable when
applied to the speech domain, with the exception of word-aligned perturbation
methods when applied to word-based classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何通过结合世界价值观调查（WVS）数据与百科全书和情境文化叙事来改进大型语言模型（LLMs）的文化价值适应性，发现后者能增强文化独特性，但其对下游任务的影响不一致。

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决LLMs在文化价值适应性方面的挑战，尤其是基于WVS数据的现有方法可能存在文化同质化和干扰事实知识的问题。

Method: 方法包括系统性地研究WVS数据训练，并进一步结合来自Wikipedia和NormAd的百科全书及情境文化叙事，以增强文化表达的多样性。

Result: 结果表明，相较于仅依赖WVS数据，引入文化叙事能显著提升文化独特性，但对下游任务的性能影响存在变数。

Conclusion: 结论强调了文化价值对齐的复杂性，并建议结合多种数据源以更好地指导任务特定行为。

Abstract: Adapting cultural values in Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant
challenges, particularly due to biases and limited training data. Prior work
primarily aligns LLMs with different cultural values using World Values Survey
(WVS) data. However, it remains unclear whether this approach effectively
captures cultural nuances or produces distinct cultural representations for
various downstream tasks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
WVS-based training for cultural value adaptation and find that relying solely
on survey data can homogenize cultural norms and interfere with factual
knowledge. To investigate these issues, we augment WVS with encyclopedic and
scenario-based cultural narratives from Wikipedia and NormAd. While these
narratives may have variable effects on downstream tasks, they consistently
improve cultural distinctiveness than survey data alone. Our work highlights
the inherent complexity of aligning cultural values with the goal of guiding
task-specific behavior.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理能力上表现优异，但如何通过强化学习算法实现多工具协作推理仍是一个挑战。

Method: Tool-Star整合了六种工具，采用数据合成管道生成工具使用轨迹，并通过两阶段训练（冷启动微调和多工具自评RL算法）提升LLM的多工具协作能力。

Result: 在10多个具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，Tool-Star表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: Tool-Star为LLM的多工具协作推理提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning
capabilities via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL). However, leveraging
the RL algorithm to empower effective multi-tool collaborative reasoning in
LLMs remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Tool-Star, an
RL-based framework designed to empower LLMs to autonomously invoke multiple
external tools during stepwise reasoning. Tool-Star integrates six types of
tools and incorporates systematic designs in both data synthesis and training.
To address the scarcity of tool-use data, we propose a general tool-integrated
reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which combines tool-integrated prompting
with hint-based sampling to automatically and scalably generate tool-use
trajectories. A subsequent quality normalization and difficulty-aware
classification process filters out low-quality samples and organizes the
dataset from easy to hard. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training
framework to enhance multi-tool collaborative reasoning by: (1) cold-start
fine-tuning, which guides LLMs to explore reasoning patterns via
tool-invocation feedback; and (2) a multi-tool self-critic RL algorithm with
hierarchical reward design, which reinforces reward understanding and promotes
effective tool collaboration. Experimental analyses on over 10 challenging
reasoning benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of Tool-Star.

Motivation: 在检索增强生成（RAG）中，将生成内容可靠地归因于特定上下文片段（上下文归因）仍具挑战性，当前方法计算开销大且依赖人工标注或微调。

Method: 提出基于Jensen-Shannon散度的ARC-JSD方法，无需微调或替代建模，直接高效识别关键上下文句子。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages large language models (LLMs)
combined with external contexts to enhance the accuracy and reliability of
generated responses. However, reliably attributing generated content to
specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the
computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require
extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel
Jensen-Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context
(ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context
sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on
a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using
instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous
surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific
attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context
attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG
models.

Method: 提出WebAgent-R1框架，通过异步生成多样化的轨迹，完全依赖任务成功的二进制奖励进行学习。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中，成功将Qwen-2.5-3B的任务成功率从6.1%提升到33.9%，Llama-3.1-8B从8.5%提升到44.8%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于思考的提示策略和通过增加交互的测试时间扩展对网络任务非常有效。此外，初始化策略的差异强调了预训练阶段的重要性。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
enhancing large language models (LLMs), it has primarily focused on single-turn
tasks such as solving math problems. Training effective web agents for
multi-turn interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of
long-horizon decision-making across dynamic web interfaces. In this work, we
present WebAgent-R1, a simple yet effective end-to-end multi-turn RL framework
for training web agents. It learns directly from online interactions with web
environments by asynchronously generating diverse trajectories, entirely guided
by binary rewards depending on task success. Experiments on the WebArena-Lite
benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of WebAgent-R1, boosting the task
success rate of Qwen-2.5-3B from 6.1% to 33.9% and Llama-3.1-8B from 8.5% to
44.8%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and strong
proprietary models such as OpenAI o3. In-depth analyses reveal the
effectiveness of the thinking-based prompting strategy and test-time scaling
through increased interactions for web tasks. We further investigate different
RL initialization policies by introducing two variants, namely WebAgent-R1-Zero
and WebAgent-R1-CoT, which highlight the importance of the warm-up training
stage (i.e., behavior cloning) and provide insights on incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in web agents.

Conclusion: 本文为程序性语言的视觉内容基础研究做出了贡献，应用领域包括教育、任务指导和多模态语言理解。

Abstract: The effective communication of procedural knowledge remains a significant
challenge in natural language processing (NLP), as purely textual instructions
often fail to convey complex physical actions and spatial relationships. We
address this limitation by proposing a language-driven framework that
translates procedural text into coherent visual instructions. Our approach
models the linguistic structure of instructional content by decomposing it into
goal statements and sequential steps, then conditioning visual generation on
these linguistic elements. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a
constituency parser-based text encoding mechanism that preserves semantic
completeness even with lengthy instructions, (2) a pairwise discourse coherence
model that maintains consistency across instruction sequences, and (3) a novel
evaluation protocol specifically designed for procedural language-to-image
alignment. Our experiments across three instructional datasets (HTStep,
CaptainCook4D, and WikiAll) demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing baselines in generating visuals that accurately reflect
the linguistic content and sequential nature of instructions. This work
contributes to the growing body of research on grounding procedural language in
visual content, with applications spanning education, task guidance, and

TL;DR: RecInter是一个基于代理的推荐系统模拟平台，通过动态交互机制增强模拟的真实性，成功复现了品牌忠诚度和马太效应等现象。

Motivation: 传统A/B测试资源密集，离线方法难以处理动态用户-平台交互，现有代理模拟平台缺乏动态环境重塑机制，需要更真实的模拟平台。

Method: 引入RecInter平台，模拟用户行为动态更新物品属性，并加入商家代理进行实时互动，同时采用多维用户画像、高级代理架构及链式思维（CoT）增强的LLM微调技术。

Result: 平台显著提升了模拟可信度，成功复现了品牌忠诚度和马太效应等涌现现象，验证了交互机制对系统演化的关键作用。

Conclusion: RecInter为推荐系统研究提供了一个可信的测试平台。

Abstract: Evaluating and iterating upon recommender systems is crucial, yet traditional
A/B testing is resource-intensive, and offline methods struggle with dynamic
user-platform interactions. While agent-based simulation is promising, existing
platforms often lack a mechanism for user actions to dynamically reshape the
environment. To bridge this gap, we introduce RecInter, a novel agent-based
simulation platform for recommender systems featuring a robust interaction
mechanism. In RecInter platform, simulated user actions (e.g., likes, reviews,
purchases) dynamically update item attributes in real-time, and introduced
Merchant Agents can reply, fostering a more realistic and evolving ecosystem.
High-fidelity simulation is ensured through Multidimensional User Profiling
module, Advanced Agent Architecture, and LLM fine-tuned on Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) enriched interaction data. Our platform achieves significantly improved
simulation credibility and successfully replicates emergent phenomena like
Brand Loyalty and the Matthew Effect. Experiments demonstrate that this
interaction mechanism is pivotal for simulating realistic system evolution,
establishing our platform as a credible testbed for recommender systems
research.

Motivation: 研究多语言环境下多标签情感分类的有效方法。

Method: 比较了完全微调Transformer模型与仅训练分类器的策略，测试了不同微调策略、模型架构、损失函数、编码器和分类器的组合。

Result: 最佳模型为多个BGE模型的集成，使用CatBoost作为分类器，平均F1-macro得分为56.58。

Conclusion: 基于提示的编码器训练分类器在多语言情感分类任务中表现更优。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for SemEval 2025 Task 11 Track A, focusing
on multilabel emotion classification across 28 languages. We explore two main
strategies: fully fine-tuning transformer models and classifier-only training,
evaluating different settings such as fine-tuning strategies, model
architectures, loss functions, encoders, and classifiers. Our findings suggest
that training a classifier on top of prompt-based encoders such as mE5 and BGE
yields significantly better results than fully fine-tuning XLMR and mBERT. Our
best-performing model on the final leaderboard is an ensemble combining
multiple BGE models, where CatBoost serves as the classifier, with different
configurations. This ensemble achieves an average F1-macro score of 56.58
across all languages.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）如何通过对话中的隐性线索推断用户人口统计信息，并指出这种推断可能对少数群体造成不公平影响。研究通过合成对话和模型内部表征分析，提出了一种缓解方法。

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示LLM如何通过隐性线索（如刻板印象）推断用户人口统计信息，以及这种推断如何影响模型对不同群体的公平性。

Method: 使用受控合成对话，通过分析模型的潜在用户表征（包括模型内部状态和生成答案的针对性问题）来研究其推断行为。

Result: 研究发现，LLM确实会基于刻板印象推断人口统计信息，即使用户明确标识为其他群体时，这种推断依然存在。研究者提出一种线性探测方法，可以有效缓解这种偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对LLM用户身份表征的透明性和可控性的需求，以减少基于刻板印象的隐性推断带来的不公平影响。

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) infer user's demographic information
from subtle cues in the conversation -- a phenomenon called implicit
personalization. Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower
quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no
demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically
explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic
conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through
both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our
findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these
stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user
explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that
this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively
mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a
trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our
results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs
represent user identity.

Result: CANOE显著提升了LLMs的忠实性，在11个任务中表现优于GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: CANOE为语言模型的忠实性提供了一种无需人工标注的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to be faithful in the provided context
is crucial for building reliable information-seeking systems. Therefore, we
propose a systematic framework, CANOE, to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in
both short-form and long-form generation tasks without human annotations.
Specifically, we first synthesize short-form question-answering (QA) data with
four diverse tasks to construct high-quality and easily verifiable training
data without human annotation. Also, we propose Dual-GRPO, a rule-based
reinforcement learning method that includes three tailored rule-based rewards
derived from synthesized short-form QA data, while simultaneously optimizing
both short-form and long-form response generation. Notably, Dual-GRPO
eliminates the need to manually label preference data to train reward models
and avoids over-optimizing short-form generation when relying only on the
synthesized short-form QA data. Experimental results show that CANOE greatly
improves the faithfulness of LLMs across 11 different downstream tasks, even
outperforming the most advanced LLMs, e.g., GPT-4o and OpenAI o1.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型（LLM）在情感分析等任务中表现出色，但其情感信息的编码机制尚不明确。本研究旨在揭示情感特征的分布及其对性能的影响。

Method: 使用探针分类器分析Llama模型各层的情感编码，确定最优层和池化方法。

Result: 发现情感信息集中在中间层，准确率提升14%；解码器模型中，最后一个标记并非最有效；内存需求平均减少57%。

Conclusion: 层特定探测是情感任务的有效方法，可提升性能并降低内存需求，为LLM的情感分析提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP,
demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting
techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited
understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This
study probes the hidden layers of Llama models to pinpoint where sentiment
features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment
analysis.
  Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and
scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment
signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in
mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to
14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only
models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment
encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with
memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.
  These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs,
suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks
beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory
requirements.

Motivation: 当前法律AI研究多聚焦一审案件，忽略二审过程的重要性。二审作为纠错与保障公平审判的核心机制，亟需相关研究填补空白。

Method: 构建AppealCase数据集（1万对一审与二审文书，91类民事案件），标注五个关键维度（如判决逆转、法律条款引用等），并设计五项新任务评测20个主流模型。

Result: 所有模型在判决逆转预测任务中F1分数均低于50%，表明上诉案例的复杂性与现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: AppealCase数据集推动法律AI在二审案件分析的研究，有望提升司法决策一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in LegalAI have primarily focused on individual case judgment
analysis, often overlooking the critical appellate process within the judicial
system. Appeals serve as a core mechanism for error correction and ensuring
fair trials, making them highly significant both in practice and in research.
To address this gap, we present the AppealCase dataset, consisting of 10,000
pairs of real-world, matched first-instance and second-instance documents
across 91 categories of civil cases. The dataset also includes detailed
annotations along five dimensions central to appellate review: judgment
reversals, reversal reasons, cited legal provisions, claim-level decisions, and
whether there is new information in the second instance. Based on these
annotations, we propose five novel LegalAI tasks and conduct a comprehensive
evaluation across 20 mainstream models. Experimental results reveal that all
current models achieve less than 50% F1 scores on the judgment reversal
prediction task, highlighting the complexity and challenge of the appeal
scenario. We hope that the AppealCase dataset will spur further research in
LegalAI for appellate case analysis and contribute to improving consistency in
judicial decision-making.

Motivation: 语言模型在知识密集型任务中可能忽略相关或受无关上下文干扰，现有CMTs缺乏系统性比较。

Method: 开发CUB基准，测试七种代表性CMTs在三种上下文类型、三个数据集和九个语言模型上的表现。

Result: 大多数CMTs难以应对现实场景中的多样化上下文，且在合成数据集上表现优于自然数据集。

Conclusion: 需要全面测试CMTs并开发能处理多种上下文类型的技术。

Abstract: Incorporating external knowledge is crucial for knowledge-intensive tasks,
such as question answering and fact checking. However, language models (LMs)
may ignore relevant information that contradicts outdated parametric memory or
be distracted by irrelevant contexts. While many context utilisation
manipulation techniques (CMTs) that encourage or suppress context utilisation
have recently been proposed to alleviate these issues, few have seen systematic
comparison. In this paper, we develop CUB (Context Utilisation Benchmark) to
help practitioners within retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) identify the
best CMT for their needs. CUB allows for rigorous testing on three distinct
context types, observed to capture key challenges in realistic context
utilisation scenarios. With this benchmark, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art
methods, representative of the main categories of CMTs, across three diverse
datasets and tasks, applied to nine LMs. Our results show that most of the
existing CMTs struggle to handle the full set of types of contexts that may be
encountered in real-world retrieval-augmented scenarios. Moreover, we find that
many CMTs display an inflated performance on simple synthesised datasets,
compared to more realistic datasets with naturally occurring samples.
Altogether, our results show the need for holistic tests of CMTs and the
development of CMTs that can handle multiple context types.

Abstract: Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or
fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false
statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness.
However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism,
which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text
generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of
previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to
the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we
extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible
true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for
generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering
collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the
findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to
LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for
future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more
effective evaluation.

Motivation: 现有基准测试通常仅包含单一类型的偏见，而实际应用中数据可能包含多种偏见。为填补这一空白，需开发能同时处理多种偏见的基准和方法。

Method: 提出多偏见基准测试，并设计因果效应估计引导的多偏见消除方法（CMBE），通过估计和消除多重偏见的因果效应来提升模型表现。

Result: 实验表明，CMBE能有效同时消除多种偏见，显著提升LLMs的泛化性。

Conclusion: CMBE为处理多重偏见提供了有效解决方案，增强了LLMs在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, recent studies have indicated that current
large language models (LLMs) may still utilize bias during inference, leading
to the poor generalizability of LLMs. Some benchmarks are proposed to
investigate the generalizability of LLMs, with each piece of data typically
containing one type of controlled bias. However, a single piece of data may
contain multiple types of biases in practical applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a multi-bias benchmark where each piece of data contains five types
of biases. The evaluations conducted on this benchmark reveal that the
performance of existing LLMs and debiasing methods is unsatisfying,
highlighting the challenge of eliminating multiple types of biases
simultaneously. To overcome this challenge, we propose a causal effect
estimation-guided multi-bias elimination method (CMBE). This method first
estimates the causal effect of multiple types of biases simultaneously.
Subsequently, we eliminate the causal effect of biases from the total causal
effect exerted by both the semantic information and biases during inference.
Experimental results show that CMBE can effectively eliminate multiple types of
bias simultaneously to enhance the generalizability of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EnSToM的新方法，用于在小规模语言模型（sLLMs）中动态调整引导强度，以提升任务导向对话系统中的主题一致性。

Motivation: 小型语言模型在资源受限环境中高效，但在任务导向对话系统中难以保持主题一致性，现有方法效果有限。

Method: 提出Entropy-scaled Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM)，根据输入不确定性动态调整引导强度。

Result: 实验表明EnSToM在少量数据下显著提升性能，优于微调方法。

Conclusion: EnSToM在不牺牲效率的前提下提升主题一致性，增强了sLLM对话系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Small large language models (sLLMs) offer the advantage of being lightweight
and efficient, which makes them suitable for resource-constrained environments.
However, sLLMs often struggle to maintain topic consistency in task-oriented
dialogue systems, which is critical for scenarios such as service chatbots.
Specifically, it is important to ensure that the model denies off-topic or
malicious inputs and adheres to its intended functionality so as to prevent
potential misuse and uphold reliability. Towards this, existing activation
engineering approaches have been proposed to manipulate internal activations
during inference. While these methods are effective in certain scenarios, our
preliminary experiments reveal their limitations in ensuring topic adherence.
Therefore, to address this, we propose a novel approach termed Entropy-scaled
Steering vectors for Topic Maintenance (EnSToM). EnSToM dynamically adjusts the
steering intensity based on input uncertainty, which allows the model to handle
off-topic distractors effectively while preserving on-topic accuracy. Our
experiments demonstrate that EnSToM achieves significant performance gain with
a relatively small data size compared to fine-tuning approaches. By improving
topic adherence without compromising efficiency, our approach provides a robust
solution for enhancing sLLM-based dialogue systems.

Abstract: Language confusion -- where large language models (LLMs) generate unintended
languages against the user's need -- remains a critical challenge, especially
for English-centric models. We present the first mechanistic interpretability
(MI) study of language confusion, combining behavioral benchmarking with
neuron-level analysis. Using the Language Confusion Benchmark (LCB), we show
that confusion points (CPs) -- specific positions where language switches occur
-- are central to this phenomenon. Through layer-wise analysis with TunedLens
and targeted neuron attribution, we reveal that transition failures in the
final layers drive confusion. We further demonstrate that editing a small set
of critical neurons, identified via comparative analysis with
multilingual-tuned models, substantially mitigates confusion without harming
general competence or fluency. Our approach matches multilingual alignment in
confusion reduction for most languages and yields cleaner, higher-quality
outputs. These findings provide new insights into the internal dynamics of LLMs
and highlight neuron-level interventions as a promising direction for robust,
interpretable multilingual language modeling.

TL;DR: CoLaR提出了一种动态压缩推理过程的框架，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）在潜在空间中高效推理，显著减少推理链长度并提升性能。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）中的推理链（CoT）计算成本高且效率低，需要通过压缩潜在空间中的推理过程来优化。

Method: CoLaR采用两阶段训练：1) 监督微调，预测压缩嵌入；2) 强化学习，利用潜在头的非确定性探索多样化推理路径。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，CoLaR比基线方法准确率提升14.1%，推理链长度减少53.3%；RL增强版性能提升5.4%，推理链长度减少82.8%。

Conclusion: CoLaR通过潜在空间的高效推理，显著提升了性能和效率，适用于多种数学推理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, but these token-level reasoning chains are
computationally expensive and inefficient. In this paper, we introduce
Compressed Latent Reasoning (CoLaR), a novel framework that dynamically
compresses reasoning processes in latent space through a two-stage training
approach. First, during supervised fine-tuning, CoLaR extends beyond next-token
prediction by incorporating an auxiliary next compressed embedding prediction
objective. This process merges embeddings of consecutive tokens using a
compression factor randomly sampled from a predefined range, and trains a
specialized latent head to predict distributions of subsequent compressed
embeddings. Second, we enhance CoLaR through reinforcement learning (RL) that
leverages the latent head's non-deterministic nature to explore diverse
reasoning paths and exploit more compact ones. This approach enables CoLaR to:
i) perform reasoning at a dense latent level (i.e., silently), substantially
reducing reasoning chain length, and ii) dynamically adjust reasoning speed at
inference time by simply prompting the desired compression factor. Extensive
experiments across four mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that CoLaR
achieves 14.1% higher accuracy than latent-based baseline methods at comparable
compression ratios, and reduces reasoning chain length by 53.3% with only 4.8%
performance degradation compared to explicit CoT method. Moreover, when applied
to more challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, our RL-enhanced CoLaR
demonstrates performance gains of up to 5.4% while dramatically reducing latent
reasoning chain length by 82.8%. The code and models will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Prior benchmarks for evaluating the domain-specific knowledge of large

To address this, we introduce \texttt{ScholarBench}, a benchmark centered on
deep expert knowledge and complex academic problem-solving, which evaluates the
academic reasoning ability of LLMs and is constructed through a three-step
process. \texttt{ScholarBench} targets more specialized and logically complex

types. Unlike prior benchmarks, \texttt{ScholarBench} evaluates the
abstraction, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs across eight
distinct research domains. To ensure high-quality evaluation data, we define
category-specific example attributes and design questions that are aligned with
the characteristic research methodologies and discourse structures of each
domain. Additionally, this benchmark operates as an English-Korean bilingual
dataset, facilitating simultaneous evaluation for linguistic capabilities of
LLMs in both languages. The benchmark comprises 5,031 examples in Korean and
5,309 in English, with even state-of-the-art models like o3-mini achieving an

Motivation: 探索不同类型的上下文元数据对LLMs预训练和下游任务性能的影响，以提升模型效率和生成的可控性。

Method: 系统评估多种元数据（如URL、质量评分、主题/格式）在预训练中的作用，分析其在不同条件下的效果。

Result: 仅URL元数据能加速训练；质量和主题元数据无明确帮助。URL元数据在长提示下能提升下游性能。主题/格式元数据虽不加速训练，但可用于生成控制。

Conclusion: 上下文元数据的有效性取决于类型和使用条件，URL信息最有用，而主题/格式元数据适用于生成控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly pretrained on vast corpora of text
without utilizing contextual metadata such as source, quality, or topic,
leading to a context-free learning paradigm. While recent studies suggest that
adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not
used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream
performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are
truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a
systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally.
Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format
domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream
performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at
inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining
enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a
classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not
accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering
human-interpretable control over generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EMULATE的新系统，通过多智能体框架更好地模拟人类行为来验证事实，相比先前方法有明显改进。

Motivation: 传统事实核查系统通过检索证据并分类的方式与人类行为不符，需要更接近人类处理方式的改进方法。

Method: 提出了EMULATE系统，采用多智能体框架，每个智能体负责一小部分任务（如排名搜索结果或评估网页内容）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现出优于先前工作的效果，证明了多智能体框架的有效性。

Conclusion: EMULATE系统通过模拟人类行为显著提升了事实核查的准确性。

Abstract: Determining the veracity of atomic claims is an imperative component of many
recently proposed fact-checking systems. Many approaches tackle this problem by
first retrieving evidence by querying a search engine and then performing
classification by providing the evidence set and atomic claim to a large
language model, but this process deviates from what a human would do in order
to perform the task. Recent work attempted to address this issue by proposing
iterative evidence retrieval, allowing for evidence to be collected several
times and only when necessary. Continuing along this line of research, we
propose a novel claim verification system, called EMULATE, which is designed to
better emulate human actions through the use of a multi-agent framework where
each agent performs a small part of the larger task, such as ranking search
results according to predefined criteria or evaluating webpage content.
Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show clear improvements over prior
work, demonstrating the efficacy of our new multi-agent framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了O2-Searcher，一种新型搜索代理，利用强化学习解决开放域中的开放性和封闭性问题，并通过动态知识获取和统一训练机制提升性能。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）受限于静态参数化知识，无法有效处理需要开放域最新信息的任务，尤其是开放性问题。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: O2-Searcher通过模拟局部搜索环境动态获取知识，采用强化学习框架和精心设计的奖励函数，区分问题类型并调整答案生成策略。

Result: O2-Searcher在O2-QA基准测试中显著优于其他LLM代理，并在封闭性问题基准测试中达到同类模型的最优性能。

Conclusion: O2-Searcher为开放性和封闭性问题提供了一种高效的解决方案，显示出小模型也能在复杂任务上表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advancements, are fundamentally
limited by their static parametric knowledge, hindering performance on tasks
requiring open-domain up-to-date information. While enabling LLMs to interact
with external knowledge environments is a promising solution, current efforts
primarily address closed-end problems. Open-ended questions, which
characterized by lacking a standard answer or providing non-unique and diverse
answers, remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present O$^2$-Searcher, a
novel search agent leveraging reinforcement learning to effectively tackle both
open-ended and closed-ended questions in the open domain. O$^2$-Searcher
leverages an efficient, locally simulated search environment for dynamic
knowledge acquisition, effectively decoupling the external world knowledge from
model's sophisticated reasoning processes. It employs a unified training
mechanism with meticulously designed reward functions, enabling the agent to
identify problem types and adapt different answer generation strategies.
Furthermore, to evaluate performance on complex open-ended tasks, we construct
O$^2$-QA, a high-quality benchmark featuring 300 manually curated, multi-domain
open-ended questions with associated web page caches. Extensive experiments
show that O$^2$-Searcher, using only a 3B model, significantly surpasses
leading LLM agents on O$^2$-QA. It also achieves SOTA results on various
closed-ended QA benchmarks against similarly-sized models, while performing on
par with much larger ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KoLasSimpleQA是首个评估大语言模型（LLM）多语言事实能力的基准，支持9种语言并覆盖通用和特定语言领域，旨在高效评估LLM的事实记忆和自我认知能力。

Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对LLM多语言事实能力的全面评估，KoLasSimpleQA填补了这一空白，帮助识别LLM在多语言环境中的能力边界。

Method: 通过设计单知识点、客观性、唯一答案和时序稳定的问题，并采用LLM-as-judge范式进行评估，覆盖9种语言和双重领域（通用和语言特定）。

Result: 主流LLMs在双重领域中表现出显著性能差异，尤其在性能指标、排名、校准和鲁棒性方面。

Conclusion: KoLasSimpleQA为多语言环境下LLM的评估和优化提供了重要指导，未来将公开发布。

Abstract: We introduce KoLasSimpleQA, the first benchmark evaluating the multilingual
factual ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by existing research,
we created the question set with features such as single knowledge point
coverage, absolute objectivity, unique answers, and temporal stability. These
questions enable efficient evaluation using the LLM-as-judge paradigm, testing
both the LLMs' factual memory and self-awareness ("know what they don't know").
KoLasSimpleQA expands existing research in two key dimensions: (1) Breadth
(Multilingual Coverage): It includes 9 languages, supporting global
applicability evaluation. (2) Depth (Dual Domain Design): It covers both the
general domain (global facts) and the language-specific domain (such as
history, culture, and regional traditions) for a comprehensive assessment of
multilingual capabilities. We evaluated mainstream LLMs, including traditional
LLM and emerging Large Reasoning Models. Results show significant performance
differences between the two domains, particularly in performance metrics,
ranking, calibration, and robustness. This highlights the need for targeted
evaluation and optimization in multilingual contexts. We hope KoLasSimpleQA
will help the research community better identify LLM capability boundaries in
multilingual contexts and provide guidance for model optimization. We will
release KoLasSimpleQA at https://github.com/opendatalab/KoLasSimpleQA .

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了媒体框架与立场在气候变化互联网模因中的相互作用，创建了首个气候模因数据集CLIMATEMEMES，并评估了视觉语言模型和大型语言模型在立场和框架检测任务中的表现。

Motivation: 研究旨在填补媒体框架与立场交互研究的空白，特别是在气候变化互联网模因中，通过跨学科方法探索这一未被充分研究的领域。

Method: 研究人员创建了包含1184个模因的数据集CLIMATEMEMES，标注了立场和媒体框架，并提出了立场检测和媒体框架检测任务，评估了LLaVA-NeXT和Molmo等模型的表现。

Result: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在立场检测上表现良好，但在框架检测上表现不佳，大型语言模型（LLMs）则相反。人类标注的标题持续提升模型性能，合成标题和OCR校正也有帮助。

Conclusion: 研究发现VLMs在处理气候变化模因的细微框架和立场表达方面存在局限性，而LLMs在框架检测上表现更优，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Media framing refers to the emphasis on specific aspects of perceived reality
to shape how an issue is defined and understood. Its primary purpose is to
shape public perceptions often in alignment with the authors' opinions and
stances. However, the interaction between stance and media frame remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we apply an interdisciplinary approach to
conceptualize and computationally explore this interaction with internet memes
on climate change. We curate CLIMATEMEMES, the first dataset of climate-change
memes annotated with both stance and media frames, inspired by research in
communication science. CLIMATEMEMES includes 1,184 memes sourced from 47
subreddits, enabling analysis of frame prominence over time and communities,
and sheds light on the framing preferences of different stance holders. We
propose two meme understanding tasks: stance detection and media frame
detection. We evaluate LLaVA-NeXT and Molmo in various setups, and report the
corresponding results on their LLM backbone. Human captions consistently
enhance performance. Synthetic captions and human-corrected OCR also help
occasionally. Our findings highlight that VLMs perform well on stance, but
struggle on frames, where LLMs outperform VLMs. Finally, we analyze VLMs'
limitations in handling nuanced frames and stance expressions on climate change
internet memes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自我进化框架，用于改善大型语言模型在情感支持中的个性化响应能力，通过两个阶段实现：情感支持经验获取和自我改进。实验表明，该方法显著提升了模型的性能。

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在情感支持中常提供泛化且不适合个性化需求的响应，无法满足用户的特定情感需求。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段的自我进化框架，包括情感支持经验获取和自我改进，通过自我反射和优化来生成个性化响应。

Result: 实验证明，该方法显著减少了无帮助的响应，并缩小了用户偏好与模型输出之间的差异。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了大型语言模型在情感支持中的个性化响应能力，满足用户的特定需求。

Abstract: Effective emotional support hinges on understanding users' emotions and needs
to provide meaningful comfort during multi-turn interactions. Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential for expressing empathy; however, they often
deliver generic and one-size-fits-all responses that fail to address users'
specific needs. To tackle this issue, we propose a self-evolution framework
designed to help LLMs improve their responses to better align with users'
implicit preferences concerning user profiles (personalities), emotional
states, and specific situations. Our framework consists of two distinct phases:
\textit{(1)} \textit{Emotional Support Experience Acquisition}, where LLMs are
fine-tuned on limited emotional support conversation data to provide basic
support, and \textit{(2)} \textit{Self-Improvement for Personalized Emotional
Support}, where LLMs leverage self-reflection and self-refinement to generate
personalized responses. Through iterative direct preference optimization
between the pre- and post-refined responses, our model generates responses that
reflect a better understanding of the user's implicit preferences. Extensive
experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly enhances
the model's performance in emotional support, reducing unhelpful responses and
minimizing discrepancies between user preferences and model outputs.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何在低资源环境下利用大语言模型生成个性化翻译，重点关注文学翻译领域，并提出了一种基于对比框架的方法来实现个性化风格控制。

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的高质量机器翻译系统在满足明确风格约束时表现良好，但在风格要求较隐晦时表现不佳，尤其是在低资源环境下。

Method: 研究了提示策略和推理时干预方法，并提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器提取潜在概念的对比框架，用于识别个性化特性。

Result: 实验表明，通过这些方法可以显著提升翻译的个性化效果，同时保持翻译质量，并且发现多示例提示与提出的控制方法对模型层的影响相似。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在个性化翻译中表现优异，为低资源环境下的风格控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality machine translation systems based on large language models
(LLMs) have simplified the production of personalized translations reflecting
specific stylistic constraints. However, these systems still struggle in
settings where stylistic requirements are less explicit and might be harder to
convey via prompting. We explore various strategies for personalizing
LLM-generated translations in low-resource settings, focusing on the
challenging literary translation domain. We explore prompting strategies and
inference-time interventions for steering model generations towards a
personalized style, and propose a contrastive framework exploiting latent
concepts extracted from sparse autoencoders to identify salient personalization
properties. Our results show that steering achieves strong personalization
while preserving translation quality. We further examine the impact of steering
on LLM representations, finding model layers with a relevant impact for
personalization are impacted similarly by multi-shot prompting and our steering
method, suggesting similar mechanism at play.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于自奖励强化学习的机器翻译框架SSR，无需外部监督信号，仅依赖自判断奖励，在英中翻译任务上表现优异，甚至超越了一些闭源大模型。

Motivation: 解决当前机器翻译大模型依赖昂贵外部监督信号的问题，探索自奖励强化学习在MT中的潜力。

Method: 提出Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR)强化学习框架，完全在线且无需参考数据，仅使用自判断奖励。

Result: SSR-Zero-7B在英中翻译任务上超越现有模型，结合COMET监督后，SSR-X-Zero-7B达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 自奖励机制在MT中表现优异，与外部监督结合可进一步提升性能，为自改进RL方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in machine translation (MT). However, most advanced MT-specific
LLMs heavily rely on external supervision signals during training, such as
human-annotated reference data or trained reward models (RMs), which are often
expensive to obtain and challenging to scale. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Simple Self-Rewarding (SSR) Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for
MT that is reference-free, fully online, and relies solely on self-judging
rewards. Training with SSR using 13K monolingual examples and Qwen-2.5-7B as
the backbone, our model SSR-Zero-7B outperforms existing MT-specific LLMs,
e.g., TowerInstruct-13B and GemmaX-28-9B, as well as larger general LLMs like
Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese translation tasks
from WMT23, WMT24, and Flores200 benchmarks. Furthermore, by augmenting SSR
with external supervision from COMET, our strongest model, SSR-X-Zero-7B,
achieves state-of-the-art performance in English $\leftrightarrow$ Chinese
translation, surpassing all existing open-source models under 72B parameters
and even outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro.
Our analysis highlights the effectiveness of the self-rewarding mechanism
compared to the external LLM-as-a-judge approach in MT and demonstrates its
complementary benefits when combined with trained RMs. Our findings provide
valuable insight into the potential of self-improving RL methods. We have
publicly released our code, data and models.

Abstract: Empowered by vast internal knowledge reservoir, the new generation of large

However, there is insufficient effort made towards summoning up a synergic

our framework is proved to boost all LLMs reasoning ability as well as
alleviate their divergence among questions. We also measure an LLM's confidence
when it confronts with adversary opinions from other LLMs and observe a
concurrence between LLM's confidence and prediction accuracy.

Motivation: 解决中国古代数学经典智能处理的挑战，挖掘数学知识并传播传统文化，同时为推理模型跨语言和跨文化能力提供新视角。

Method: 通过机器辅助标注与人工验证，从8部经典中提取538个数学问题，构建结构化数据集，设计封闭式和开放式双评价模式评估六种推理模型。

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese
ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for
evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses
the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models
under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through
machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems
were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on
the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and
difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous
problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were
designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese
mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially
comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains
inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models'
classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized
for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining
mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional
culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了为日语特定领域构建实用语言模型的可行性，并为制药和医疗NLP提供了可重用的评估资源。

Abstract: We present a Japanese domain-specific language model for the pharmaceutical
field, developed through continual pretraining on 2 billion Japanese
pharmaceutical tokens and 8 billion English biomedical tokens. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce three new benchmarks: YakugakuQA, based on
national pharmacist licensing exams; NayoseQA, which tests cross-lingual
synonym and terminology normalization; and SogoCheck, a novel task designed to
assess consistency reasoning between paired statements. We evaluate our model
against both open-source medical LLMs and commercial models, including GPT-4o.
Results show that our domain-specific model outperforms existing open models
and achieves competitive performance with commercial ones, particularly on
terminology-heavy and knowledge-based tasks. Interestingly, even GPT-4o
performs poorly on SogoCheck, suggesting that cross-sentence consistency
reasoning remains an open challenge. Our benchmark suite offers a broader
diagnostic lens for pharmaceutical NLP, covering factual recall, lexical
variation, and logical consistency. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
building practical, secure, and cost-effective language models for Japanese
domain-specific applications, and provides reusable evaluation resources for
future research in pharmaceutical and healthcare NLP. Our model, codes, and

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型如何通过上下文进行元学习，而非仅从上下文中复制答案，这一问题尚未深入探索。

Method: 扩展了之前的复制任务，构建了上下文元学习场景，分析模型在不同训练阶段的电路动态变化。

Result: 发现元学习能力的获得涉及多个阶段，每个阶段出现独特的电路，与单一阶段的归纳头部变化形成对比。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer模型上下文学习能力的来源，加深了对相关现象的理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where
predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links
induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account
for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important
property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn
how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context;
how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this
paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by
analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we
extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning
setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries.
Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the
process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each
phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The
emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large
language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source
of the transformer's ICL ability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Locate-then-Merge的无训练参数融合框架，通过定位重要参数并选择性融合，缓解多模态指令调整导致的LLM语言能力退化。

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多模态指令调整阶段容易导致基础LLM的语言能力退化，即使是Llama3这样的强模型也受到影响。

Method: 提出了Locate-then-Merge框架，包括定位重要参数和选择性融合的步骤；进一步提出Neuron-Fusion，一种神经元级策略，保留参数变化大的神经元以维持视觉能力，减弱变化小的神经元以保护通用语言能力。

Result: 在13个语言和视觉任务的基准测试中，Neuron-Fusion优于现有模型融合方法；分析表明，该方法有效减少了生成中的上下文幻觉。

Conclusion: Locate-then-Merge和Neuron-Fusion能更好地保留视觉适应能力，同时减轻语言能力退化。

Abstract: Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive
performance, the multimodal instruction tuning stage often causes catastrophic
forgetting of the base LLM's language ability, even in strong models like
Llama3. To address this, we propose Locate-then-Merge, a training-free
parameter fusion framework that first locates important parameters and then
selectively merges them. We further introduce Neuron-Fusion, a neuron-level
strategy that preserves the influence of neurons with large parameter
shifts--neurons likely responsible for newly acquired visual
capabilities--while attenuating the influence of neurons with smaller changes
that likely encode general-purpose language skills. This design enables better
retention of visual adaptation while mitigating language degradation.
Experiments on 13 benchmarks across both language and visual tasks show that
Neuron-Fusion consistently outperforms existing model merging methods. Further
analysis reveals that our method effectively reduces context hallucination in
generation.

TL;DR: TRIM提出了一种新颖的剪枝方法，通过针对每个层的输出维度（行）应用不同的稀疏率，优化稀疏分配并保留关键信息，显著提升了大型语言模型的性能。

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLM）规模庞大，剪枝对其高效部署至关重要。现有的一步剪枝方法通常采用统一的稀疏约束，导致在高稀疏率下性能不佳。

Result: TRIM在Qwen2.5、LLaMA-2和OPT等模型上实现了新的最先进性能。例如，在80%稀疏率下，TRIM将Qwen2.5-14B的困惑度降低了48%，OPT-13B的困惑度降低了90%以上。

Conclusion: 研究表明，细粒度的维度级稀疏适应对于推动LLM极限压缩至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant computational and memory
challenges due to their extensive size, making pruning essential for their
efficient deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods often apply uniform
sparsity constraints across layers or within each layer, resulting in
suboptimal performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. This work
introduces TRIM (Targeted Row-wise Iterative Metric-driven pruning), a novel
approach that applies varying sparsity ratios to individual output dimensions
(rows) within each layer. TRIM employs an iterative adjustment process guided
by quality metrics to optimize dimension-wise sparsity allocation, focusing on
reducing variance in quality retention across outputs to preserve critical
information. TRIM can be seamlessly integrated with existing layer-wise pruning
strategies. Our evaluations on perplexity and zero-shot tasks across diverse
LLM families (Qwen2.5, LLaMA-2, and OPT) and sparsity levels demonstrate that
TRIM achieves new state-of-the-art results and enhances stability. For
instance, at 80% sparsity, TRIM reduces perplexity by 48% for Qwen2.5-14B and
over 90% for OPT-13B compared to baseline methods. We conclude that
fine-grained, dimension-wise sparsity adaptation is crucial for pushing the
limits of extreme LLM compression. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IFEval-Audio数据集用于评估音频大语言模型的指令跟随能力，填补了该领域的空白。

Motivation: 研究音频大语言模型的指令跟随能力，目前该领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出IFEval-Audio数据集，包含280个音频-指令-答案三元组，涵盖六个维度。

Result: 通过公开数据集，为音频大语言模型的指令跟随性能提供基准。

Conclusion: IFEval-Audio支持未来在音频LLM指令跟随能力方面的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong instruction-following
capabilities in text-based tasks. However, this ability often deteriorates in
multimodal models after alignment with non-text modalities such as images or
audio. While several recent efforts have investigated instruction-following
performance in text and vision-language models, instruction-following in
audio-based large language models remains largely unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we introduce IFEval-Audio, a novel evaluation dataset designed to assess
the ability to follow instructions in an audio LLM. IFEval-Audio contains 280
audio-instruction-answer triples across six diverse dimensions: Content,
Capitalization, Symbol, List Structure, Length, and Format. Each example pairs
an audio input with a text instruction, requiring the model to generate an
output that follows a specified structure. We benchmark state-of-the-art audio
LLMs on their ability to follow audio-involved instructions. The dataset is
released publicly to support future research in this emerging area.

Conclusion: 潜在CoT推理是一个充满潜力的研究方向，未来研究可以从分类法的四个角度进一步探索和创新。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, conventional
CoT relies on reasoning steps explicitly verbalized in natural language,
introducing inefficiencies and limiting its applicability to abstract
reasoning. To address this, there has been growing research interest in latent
CoT reasoning, where inference occurs within latent spaces. By decoupling
reasoning from language, latent reasoning promises richer cognitive
representations and more flexible, faster inference. Researchers have explored
various directions in this promising field, including training methodologies,
structural innovations, and internal reasoning mechanisms. This paper presents
a comprehensive overview and analysis of this reasoning paradigm. We begin by
proposing a unified taxonomy from four perspectives: token-wise strategies,
internal mechanisms, analysis, and applications. We then provide in-depth
discussions and comparative analyses of representative methods, highlighting
their design patterns, strengths, and open challenges. We aim to provide a
structured foundation for advancing this emerging direction in LLM reasoning.

Result: 研究发现数据集特性与模型在对抗攻击中的表现存在相关性，进一步探索了潜在的因果关系。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据集设计在保持模型对齐中的关键作用，为对抗防御策略提供了新见解。

Abstract: As large language models gain popularity, their vulnerability to adversarial
attacks remains a primary concern. While fine-tuning models on domain-specific
datasets is often employed to improve model performance, it can introduce
vulnerabilities within the underlying model. In this work, we investigate
Accidental Misalignment, unexpected vulnerabilities arising from
characteristics of fine-tuning data. We begin by identifying potential
correlation factors such as linguistic features, semantic similarity, and
toxicity within our experimental datasets. We then evaluate the adversarial
performance of these fine-tuned models and assess how dataset factors correlate
with attack success rates. Lastly, we explore potential causal links, offering
new insights into adversarial defense strategies and highlighting the crucial
role of dataset design in preserving model alignment. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型多步推理任务中面临证据提取困难和推理准确性不足的挑战，现有方法常因提取逻辑无关证据导致错误推理。

Method: 提出了TW-ESA模块用于证据逻辑对齐，以及DGR模块用于逐步融合有用知识，两者在ESA-DGR框架中协同训练。

Result: 实验显示ESA-DGR在三个数据集上显著优于现有方法，EM和F1分数分别平均提升4%和5%。

Conclusion: ESA-DGR通过改进证据提取和推理增强，有效提升大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties in knowledge-intensive
multi-step reasoning (KIMSR) tasks. One challenge is how to effectively extract
and represent rationale evidence. The current methods often extract
semantically relevant but logically irrelevant evidence, resulting in flawed
reasoning and inaccurate responses. We propose a two-way evidence
self-alignment (TW-ESA) module, which utilizes the mutual alignment between
strict reasoning and LLM reasoning to enhance its understanding of the causal
logic of evidence, thereby addressing the first challenge. Another challenge is
how to utilize the rationale evidence and LLM's intrinsic knowledge for
accurate reasoning when the evidence contains uncertainty. We propose a
dual-gated reasoning enhancement (DGR) module to gradually fuse useful
knowledge of LLM within strict reasoning, which can enable the model to perform
accurate reasoning by focusing on causal elements in the evidence and exhibit
greater robustness. The two modules are collaboratively trained in a unified
framework ESA-DGR. Extensive experiments on three diverse and challenging KIMSR
datasets reveal that ESA-DGR significantly surpasses state-of-the-art LLM-based
fine-tuning methods, with remarkable average improvements of 4% in exact match
(EM) and 5% in F1 score. The implementation code is available at

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition(NER) for low-resource languages aims to produce
robust systems for languages where there is limited labeled training data
available, and has been an area of increasing interest within NLP. Data
augmentation for increasing the amount of low-resource labeled data is a common
practice. In this paper, we explore the role of synthetic data in the context
of multilingual, low-resource NER, considering 11 languages from diverse
language families. Our results suggest that synthetic data does in fact hold
promise for low-resource language NER, though we see significant variation
between languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出，大型语言模型（LLM）中的“遗忘”行为当前评估标准依赖于词级指标（如准确性和困惑度），但这些指标可能具有误导性。通过引入表示级评估框架，作者揭示了可逆与不可逆遗忘的关键区别，并提供了分析工具。

Motivation: 当前LLM中的遗忘评估方法主要依赖词级指标，但这些指标无法准确反映模型是否真正“遗忘”了数据信息，可能导致误解。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于表示级的评估框架，包括PCA相似性与偏移、中心核对齐和Fisher信息，并在六种遗忘方法、三个领域和两种开源LLM中应用这一工具包。

Result: 研究发现，可逆遗忘中模型仅表现为词级崩溃但保留潜在特征，而不可逆遗忘则导致更深的表示损坏。此外，任务类型和超参数会影响可逆性。

Conclusion: 现有评估方法存在根本性缺陷，作者提出的框架为可信赖的遗忘评估提供了新基础，并提供了分析工具。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is intended to remove the
influence of specific data, yet current evaluations rely heavily on token-level
metrics such as accuracy and perplexity. We show that these metrics can be
misleading: models often appear to forget, but their original behavior can be
rapidly restored with minimal fine-tuning, revealing that unlearning may
obscure information rather than erase it. To diagnose this phenomenon, we
introduce a representation-level evaluation framework using PCA-based
similarity and shift, centered kernel alignment, and Fisher information.
Applying this toolkit across six unlearning methods, three domains (text, code,
math), and two open-source LLMs, we uncover a critical distinction between
reversible and irreversible forgetting. In reversible cases, models suffer
token-level collapse yet retain latent features; in irreversible cases, deeper
representational damage occurs. We further provide a theoretical account
linking shallow weight perturbations near output layers to misleading
unlearning signals, and show that reversibility is modulated by task type and
hyperparameters. Our findings reveal a fundamental gap in current evaluation
practices and establish a new diagnostic foundation for trustworthy unlearning
in LLMs. We provide a unified toolkit for analyzing LLM representation changes
under unlearning and relearning:

Method: 通过模拟真实用户交互合成高质量数据，多标准优化输入输出多样性。

Result: 在五个基准测试中显著优于基于强化学习的方法。

Conclusion: SFT为高效深度搜索系统提供可行方案，解决数据稀缺瓶颈。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have advanced large language
models (LLMs) in complex deep search scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning
and iterative information retrieval. However, existing approaches face critical
limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the
distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive
computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces
SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap
through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our
approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user
interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria
curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output
side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that
SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based
baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically
addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for
efficient deep search systems. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了 R1-Compress，一种针对 Long-CoT 问题的两阶段分块压缩框架，能够在保持推理准确性的同时显著减少计算开销。

Motivation: Long-CoT的扩展由于token长度增加引入了大量计算开销，而现有压缩方法在保持局部推理信号或输出连贯性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出R1-Compress，分两阶段压缩：分块管理、LLM驱动的内部压缩，以及跨块搜索机制选择简短连贯的序列。

Result: 在MATH500等数据集上，R1-Compress显著减少token使用（约20%），同时保持92.4%的准确率（仅下降0.6%）。

Conclusion: R1-Compress有效解决了Long-CoT的计算开销问题，是一种高效且保持准确性的压缩方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by
enabling step-by-step problem-solving, yet its extension to Long-CoT introduces
substantial computational overhead due to increased token length. Existing
compression approaches -- instance-level and token-level -- either sacrifice
essential local reasoning signals like reflection or yield incoherent outputs.
To address these limitations, we propose R1-Compress, a two-stage chunk-level
compression framework that preserves both local information and coherence. Our
method segments Long-CoT into manageable chunks, applies LLM-driven inner-chunk
compression, and employs an inter-chunk search mechanism to select the short
and coherent sequence. Experiments on Qwen2.5-Instruct models across MATH500,
AIME24, and GPQA-Diamond demonstrate that R1-Compress significantly reduces
token usage while maintaining comparable reasoning accuracy. On MATH500,
R1-Compress achieves an accuracy of 92.4%, with only a 0.6% drop compared to
the Long-CoT baseline, while reducing token usage by about 20%. Source code

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for detecting inappropriately targeting

with ChatGPT. We focus on English conversation threads from Reddit, examining
comments that target individuals or groups. Our approach involves a
comprehensive annotation framework that labels a diverse data set for various
target categories and specific target words within the conversational context.
We perform a comparative analysis of annotations from human experts, crowd
annotators, and ChatGPT, revealing strengths and limitations of each method in
recognizing both explicit hate speech and subtler discriminatory language. Our
findings highlight the significant role of contextual factors in identifying
hate speech and uncover new categories of targeting, such as social belief and
body image. We also address the challenges and subjective judgments involved in
annotation and the limitations of ChatGPT in grasping nuanced language. This
study provides insights for improving automated content moderation strategies

Abstract: Tokenization is the act of breaking down text into smaller parts, or tokens,
that are easier for machines to process. This is a key phase in machine
translation (MT) models. Subword tokenization enhances this process by breaking
down words into smaller subword units, which is especially beneficial in
languages with complicated morphology or a vast vocabulary. It is useful in
capturing the intricate structure of words in Indian languages (ILs), such as
prefixes, suffixes, and other morphological variations. These languages
frequently use agglutinative structures, in which words are formed by the
combination of multiple morphemes such as suffixes, prefixes, and stems. As a
result, a suitable tokenization strategy must be chosen to address these
scenarios. This paper examines how different subword tokenization techniques,
such as SentencePiece, Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), and WordPiece Tokenization,
affect ILs. The effectiveness of these subword tokenization techniques is
investigated in statistical, neural, and multilingual neural machine
translation models. All models are examined using standard evaluation metrics,
such as the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, TER, METEOR, CHRF,
RIBES, and COMET. Based on the results, it appears that for the majority of
language pairs for the Statistical and Neural MT models, the SentencePiece
tokenizer continuously performed better than other tokenizers in terms of BLEU
score. However, BPE tokenization outperformed other tokenization techniques in
the context of Multilingual Neural Machine Translation model. The results show
that, despite using the same tokenizer and dataset for each model, translations
from ILs to English surpassed translations from English to ILs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法MPO，通过最小化主语言与目标语言之间的奖励差异，提升多语言模型的安全性对齐，同时不影响多语言通用性能。

Motivation: 当前的安全性对齐方法（如RLHF和DPO）主要针对单语言，且在多语言数据上表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提升多语言模型的安全性。

Method: 提出了多语言奖励差距优化（MPO）方法，利用主语言（如英语）的安全性对齐能力，通过最小化主语言与目标语言之间的奖励差异，实现多语言安全性对齐。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1、Gemma-2和Qwen2.5等多个模型上的实验验证了MPO的有效性，实现了多语言安全性对齐且不影响通用性能。

Conclusion: MPO成功地解决了多语言安全性对齐的挑战，是一种高效且实用的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to AI
applications worldwide, necessitating robust multilingual safety alignment to
ensure secure deployment across diverse linguistic contexts. Existing
preference learning methods for safety alignment, such as RLHF and DPO, are
primarily monolingual and struggle with noisy multilingual data. To address
these limitations, we introduce Multilingual reward gaP Optimization (MPO), a
novel approach that leverages the well-aligned safety capabilities of the
dominant language (English) to improve safety alignment across multiple
languages. MPO directly minimizes the reward gap difference between the
dominant language and target languages, effectively transferring safety
capabilities while preserving the original strengths of the dominant language.
Extensive experiments on three LLMs, LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2 and Qwen2.5, validate
MPO's efficacy in multilingual safety alignment without degrading general
multilingual utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了 CASTILLO，一个数据集，用于分析 13 种广泛使用的开源 LLM 在不同指令集下的响应长度分布，揭示了模型间和模型内的显著变异性，并支持预测模型的开发。

Motivation: 由于自回归文本生成的随机性和可变长度，有效管理大型语言模型（LLM）推理的计算资源具有挑战性。准确预测响应长度有助于主动分配资源，但现有方法要么偏向特定长度，要么忽略模型和提示的变异性。

Method: 研究者引入 CASTILLO 数据集，通过固定解码超参数为每个<提示，模型>对生成 10 次独立完成，记录响应长度及其统计（均值、标准差、百分位数等），并分析模型间的变异性。

Result: 研究发现，即使生成设置相同，模型间和模型内的响应长度也存在显著差异，还观察到模型特定行为和部分文本退化现象。

Conclusion: CASTILLO 为预测模型的开发提供了系统框架，支持生成语言模型与系统研究的交叉领域。

Abstract: Efficiently managing compute resources for Large Language Model (LLM)
inference remains challenging due to the inherently stochastic and variable
lengths of autoregressive text generation. Accurately estimating response
lengths in advance enables proactive resource allocation, yet existing
approaches either bias text generation towards certain lengths or rely on
assumptions that ignore model- and prompt-specific variability. We introduce
CASTILLO, a dataset characterizing response length distributions across 13
widely-used open-source LLMs evaluated on seven distinct instruction-following
corpora. For each $\langle$prompt, model$\rangle$ sample pair, we generate 10
independent completions using fixed decoding hyper-parameters, record the token
length of each response, and publish summary statistics (mean, std-dev,
percentiles), along with the shortest and longest completions, and the exact
generation settings. Our analysis reveals significant inter- and intra-model
variability in response lengths (even under identical generation settings), as
well as model-specific behaviors and occurrences of partial text degeneration
in only subsets of responses. CASTILLO enables the development of predictive
models for proactive scheduling and provides a systematic framework for
analyzing model-specific generation behaviors. We publicly release the dataset
and code to foster research at the intersection of generative language modeling
and systems.

TL;DR: 通过系统性研究揭示了LLMs幻觉现象与内部状态漂移的关系，并提出了预测和缓解机制的实证基础。

Motivation: 解决LLMs幻觉问题，提高其可靠性。

Method: 使用TruthfulQA构建两种16轮实验，通过三视角检测器和多种漂移指标分析幻觉现象。

Result: 发现幻觉频率和表征漂移单调增长，相关与无关上下文导致不同类型的错误，并揭示了注意力锁定阈值。

Conclusion: 研究为预测和缓解幻觉提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Hallucinations -- plausible yet erroneous outputs -- remain a critical
barrier to reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs). We present the
first systematic study linking hallucination incidence to internal-state drift
induced by incremental context injection. Using TruthfulQA, we construct two
16-round "titration" tracks per question: one appends relevant but partially
flawed snippets, the other injects deliberately misleading content. Across six
open-source LLMs, we track overt hallucination rates with a tri-perspective
detector and covert dynamics via cosine, entropy, JS and Spearman drifts of
hidden states and attention maps. Results reveal (1) monotonic growth of
hallucination frequency and representation drift that plateaus after 5--7
rounds; (2) relevant context drives deeper semantic assimilation, producing
high-confidence "self-consistent" hallucinations, whereas irrelevant context
induces topic-drift errors anchored by attention re-routing; and (3)
convergence of JS-Drift ($\sim0.69$) and Spearman-Drift ($\sim0$) marks an
"attention-locking" threshold beyond which hallucinations solidify and become
resistant to correction. Correlation analyses expose a seesaw between
assimilation capacity and attention diffusion, clarifying size-dependent error
modes. These findings supply empirical foundations for intrinsic hallucination
prediction and context-aware mitigation mechanisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的Power-Law Decay Loss（PDL）损失函数，通过在微调阶段对不同频率的token进行加权，优化文本生成的质量和多样性。

Motivation: 传统的交叉熵损失函数对所有token平等对待，导致模型过度关注高频低信息量的token，而忽略了低频但信息丰富的token。PDL通过重新加权token的贡献，解决了这一问题。

Method: PDL根据token在训练语料中的频率，采用幂律衰减的方式重新加权。降低高频token的权重，提升低频token的权重，以增强生成内容的特异性和信息量。

Result: PDL能够显著提升生成文本的质量、多样性和信息量，适用于抽象摘要、对话系统和风格迁移等任务。

Conclusion: PDL是一种基于信息论的创新损失函数，通过频率加权机制优化文本生成任务，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: During the finetuning stage of text generation tasks, standard cross-entropy
loss treats all tokens equally. This can lead models to overemphasize
high-frequency, low-information tokens, neglecting lower-frequency tokens
crucial for specificity and informativeness in generated content. This paper
introduces a novel loss function, Power-Law Decay Loss (PDL), specifically
designed to optimize the finetuning process for text generation. The core
motivation for PDL stems from observations in information theory and
linguistics: the informativeness of a token is often inversely proportional to
its frequency of occurrence. PDL re-weights the contribution of each token in
the standard cross-entropy loss based on its frequency in the training corpus,
following a power-law decay. Specifically, the weights for high-frequency
tokens are reduced, while low-frequency, information-dense tokens are assigned
higher weights. This mechanism guides the model during finetuning to focus more
on learning and generating tokens that convey specific and unique information,
thereby enhancing the quality, diversity, and informativeness of the generated
text. We theoretically elaborate on the motivation and construction of PDL and
discuss its potential applications and advantages across various text
generation finetuning tasks, such as abstractive summarization, dialogue
systems, and style transfer.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了UNCLE基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在长形式和短形式问答中表达不确定性的能力，发现当前模型在长形式生成中表现不佳，并通过实验验证了训练方法对改进性能的有效性。

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在长形式生成中容易产生幻觉，现有工作缺乏对其表达不确定性能力的直接且公平的评估。

Method: 引入UNCLE基准，包含长形式和短形式问答数据，并提出新的评估指标。通过提示和训练方法改进模型表现。

Result: 当前模型在长形式生成中无法有效表达不确定性，训练方法比提示方法效果更好。

Conclusion: UNCLE基准揭示了模型在长形式和短形式不确定性表达上的差距，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, particularly in
long-form generations. A promising direction to mitigate hallucination is to
teach LLMs to express uncertainty explicitly when they lack sufficient
knowledge. However, existing work lacks direct and fair evaluation of LLMs'
ability to express uncertainty effectively in long-form generation. To address
this gap, we first introduce UNCLE, a benchmark designed to evaluate
uncertainty expression in both long- and short-form question answering (QA).
UNCLE spans five domains and comprises 4k long-form QA instances and over 20k
short-form QA pairs. Our dataset is the first to directly bridge short- and
long-form QA with paired questions and gold-standard answers. Along with the
benchmark, we propose a suite of new metrics to assess the models' capabilities
to selectively express uncertainty. Using UNCLE, we then demonstrate that
current models fail to convey uncertainty appropriately in long-form
generation. We further explore both prompt-based and training-based methods to
improve models' performance, with the training-based methods yielding greater
gains. Further analysis of alignment gaps between short- and long-form
uncertainty expression highlights promising directions for future research
using UNCLE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化方法，通过自校正设置从语言模型中挖掘并压缩潜在的指导原则，以提升模型生成质量。该方法显著提升了小型语言模型的性能。

Motivation: 为了提高语言模型的生成质量，需要定义具体的行为属性，但手动标注这些原则费时费力。因此，研究旨在自动化挖掘和压缩这些潜在原则。

Method: 采用后验正则化的蒙特卡洛期望最大化方法，通过聚类识别有效的潜在原则，并指导模型在生成时策略性地调用这些原则。

Result: 实验显示，该方法使小型语言模型（7-8B参数）在AlpacaEval中胜率提升8-10%，MT-Bench平均分提升0.3，IFEval原则遵循胜率提升19-23%。聚类后的原则具有可解释性和多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自动化、原则驱动的后训练方法在持续自我改进中的潜力。

Abstract: When language model (LM) users aim to improve the quality of its generations,
it is crucial to specify concrete behavioral attributes that the model should
strive to reflect. However, curating such principles across many domains, even
non-exhaustively, requires a labor-intensive annotation process. To automate
this process, we propose eliciting these latent attributes guiding model
reasoning towards human-preferred responses by explicitly modeling them in a
self-correction setting. Our approach mines new principles from the LM itself
and compresses the discovered elements to an interpretable set via clustering.
Specifically, we employ an approximation of posterior-regularized Monte Carlo
Expectation-Maximization to both identify a condensed set of the most effective
latent principles and teach the LM to strategically invoke them in order to
intrinsically refine its responses. We demonstrate that bootstrapping our
algorithm over multiple iterations enables smaller language models (7-8B
parameters) to self-improve, achieving +8-10% in AlpacaEval win-rate, an
average of +0.3 on MT-Bench, and +19-23% in principle-following win-rate on
IFEval. We also show that clustering the principles yields interpretable and
diverse model-generated constitutions while retaining model performance. The
gains our method achieves highlight the potential of automated,
principle-driven post-training recipes toward continual self-improvement.

TL;DR: PIIvot是一个轻量级的PII匿名化框架，通过利用数据上下文知识简化PII检测问题。

Motivation: 解决高风险的PII匿名化问题，促进开放科学数据共享。

Method: 提出PIIvot框架，利用数据上下文简化PII检测。

Result: 发布QATD-2k，最大开源辅导对话数据集。

Conclusion: PIIvot框架有效简化PII匿名化问题，支持教育对话数据需求。

Abstract: Personally identifiable information (PII) anonymization is a high-stakes task
that poses a barrier to many open-science data sharing initiatives. While PII
identification has made large strides in recent years, in practice, error
thresholds and the recall/precision trade-off still limit the uptake of these
anonymization pipelines. We present PIIvot, a lighter-weight framework for PII
anonymization that leverages knowledge of the data context to simplify the PII
detection problem. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we also contribute
QATD-2k, the largest open-source real-world tutoring dataset of its kind, to
support the demand for quality educational dialogue data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示工程的模型无关水印技术（ICW），解决了现有水印方法需要访问解码过程的局限性，并通过实验验证了其可行性。

Motivation: 针对现有水印技术需要访问解码过程的限制，尤其是在实际应用中（如学术同行评审中检测AI生成的评审），研究了一种无需模型访问的水印方法。

Method: 提出了In-Context Watermarking（ICW），通过提示工程在生成文本中嵌入水印，利用大语言模型的上下文学习和指令遵循能力。研究了四种粒度不同的ICW策略及其检测方法，并以间接提示注入（IPI）为例进行了案例研究。

Result: 实验验证了ICW作为一种模型无关且实用的水印方法的可行性，并表明随着大语言模型能力提升，ICW有望成为一种可扩展且易于实现的内容溯源方案。

Conclusion: ICW为无需模型访问的水印技术提供了新的方向，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for sensitive applications
has highlighted the need for effective watermarking techniques to ensure the
provenance and accountability of AI-generated text. However, most existing
watermarking methods require access to the decoding process, limiting their
applicability in real-world settings. One illustrative example is the use of
LLMs by dishonest reviewers in the context of academic peer review, where
conference organizers have no access to the model used but still need to detect
AI-generated reviews. Motivated by this gap, we introduce In-Context
Watermarking (ICW), which embeds watermarks into generated text solely through
prompt engineering, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning and
instruction-following abilities. We investigate four ICW strategies at
different levels of granularity, each paired with a tailored detection method.
We further examine the Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) setting as a specific
case study, in which watermarking is covertly triggered by modifying input
documents such as academic manuscripts. Our experiments validate the
feasibility of ICW as a model-agnostic, practical watermarking approach.
Moreover, our findings suggest that as LLMs become more capable, ICW offers a
promising direction for scalable and accessible content attribution.

TL;DR: 结合两步知识蒸馏、结构化剪枝和词汇修剪等方法，实现了多语言编码器语言模型的极端压缩。

Motivation: 为低资源语言压缩多语言模型，保留核心语言知识。

Method: 结合知识蒸馏、剪枝和词汇修剪，减少层深度和中间层大小。

Result: 压缩率达92%，性能仅下降2-10%，性能损失与教师模型数据集大小相关。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言压缩中效果显著，性能损失可控。

Abstract: In this paper, we combine two-step knowledge distillation, structured
pruning, truncation, and vocabulary trimming for extremely compressing
multilingual encoder-only language models for low-resource languages. Our novel
approach systematically combines existing techniques and takes them to the
extreme, reducing layer depth, feed-forward hidden size, and intermediate layer
embedding size to create significantly smaller monolingual models while
retaining essential language-specific knowledge. We achieve compression rates
of up to 92% with only a marginal performance drop of 2-10% in four downstream
tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, named entity
recognition, and part-of-speech tagging, across three low-resource languages.
Notably, the performance degradation correlates with the amount of
language-specific data in the teacher model, with larger datasets resulting in
smaller performance losses. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
to identify best practices for multilingual model compression using these
techniques.

Motivation: 基于句子语义的文本分割在许多下游应用中具有广泛用途，但现有方法在捕获局部一致性和远距离语义相似性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出BP-Seg方法，利用图模型中的信念传播，兼顾相邻句子的局部相关性和远距离句子的语义相似性。

Conclusion: BP-Seg通过图模型有效结合局部和全局信息，提升了文本分割的性能。

Abstract: Text segmentation based on the semantic meaning of sentences is a fundamental
task with broad utility in many downstream applications. In this paper, we
propose a graphical model-based unsupervised learning approach, named BP-Seg
for efficient text segmentation. Our method not only considers local coherence,
capturing the intuition that adjacent sentences are often more related, but
also effectively groups sentences that are distant in the text yet semantically
similar. This is achieved through belief propagation on the carefully
constructed graphical models. Experimental results on both an illustrative
example and a dataset with long-form documents demonstrate that our method
performs favorably compared to competing approaches.

TL;DR: Speech Back-Translation利用文本转语音技术生成大量合成语音，显著提升多语言ASR模型的性能，即使在资源有限的语言中也能实现30%以上的转录错误减少。

Motivation: 解决资源有限语言在多语言ASR系统中的覆盖问题。

Method: 使用现成的TTS模型将大规模文本语料转换为合成语音，并开发基于可懂度的评估框架。

Result: 生成了50万小时以上的合成语音，Whisper-large-v3的转录错误平均减少30%以上。

Conclusion: Speech Back-Translation可扩展且高效，显著提升多语言ASR性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) have been largely
fueled by massive speech corpora. However, extending coverage to diverse
languages with limited resources remains a formidable challenge. This paper
introduces Speech Back-Translation, a scalable pipeline that improves
multilingual ASR models by converting large-scale text corpora into synthetic
speech via off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) models. We demonstrate that just
tens of hours of real transcribed speech can effectively train TTS models to
generate synthetic speech at hundreds of times the original volume while
maintaining high quality. To evaluate synthetic speech quality, we develop an
intelligibility-based assessment framework and establish clear thresholds for
when synthetic data benefits ASR training. Using Speech Back-Translation, we
generate more than 500,000 hours of synthetic speech in ten languages and
continue pre-training Whisper-large-v3, achieving average transcription error
reductions of over 30\%. These results highlight the scalability and
effectiveness of Speech Back-Translation for enhancing multilingual ASR
systems.

TL;DR: VeriFastScore通过微调Llama3.1 8B模型，结合Google Search证据，实现了快速评估长文本事实性，比原方法快6.6倍。

Motivation: 现有方法（如FactScore和VeriScore）因分解和验证单个原子声明而耗时，限制了其在大规模评估和训练中的实用性。

Method: 提出VeriFastScore，利用合成数据微调Llama3.1 8B模型，同时提取和验证所有可验证声明。

Result: VeriFastScore与原VeriScore在示例和系统级别相关性高（r=0.80和r=0.94），速度提升了6.6倍。

Conclusion: VeriFastScore在保持高性能的同时显著提升了评估效率，并公开了模型和数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Metrics like FactScore and VeriScore that evaluate long-form factuality
operate by decomposing an input response into atomic claims and then
individually verifying each claim. While effective and interpretable, these
methods incur numerous LLM calls and can take upwards of 100 seconds to
evaluate a single response, limiting their practicality in large-scale
evaluation and training scenarios. To address this, we propose VeriFastScore,
which leverages synthetic data to fine-tune Llama3.1 8B for simultaneously
extracting and verifying all verifiable claims within a given text based on
evidence from Google Search. We show that this task cannot be solved via
few-shot prompting with closed LLMs due to its complexity: the model receives
~4K tokens of evidence on average and needs to concurrently decompose claims,
judge their verifiability, and verify them against noisy evidence. However, our
fine-tuned VeriFastScore model demonstrates strong correlation with the
original VeriScore pipeline at both the example level (r=0.80) and system level
(r=0.94) while achieving an overall speedup of 6.6x (9.9x excluding evidence
retrieval) over VeriScore. To facilitate future factuality research, we
publicly release our VeriFastScore model and synthetic datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖昂贵重新编码，要么使用专用架构，缺乏扩展性，研究旨在高效适配LLM至流式场景。

Method: 引入组位置编码范式，基于批处理架构提升流式模式一致性，无需修改架构。

Result: 实验表明，方法在跨语言和跨模态任务中优于现有方法，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究证实输入-注意力不匹配是关键问题，组位置编码是流式LLM的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily designed for batch processing.
Existing methods for adapting LLMs to streaming rely either on expensive
re-encoding or specialized architectures with limited scalability. This work
identifies three key mismatches in adapting batch-oriented LLMs to streaming:
(1) input-attention, (2) output-attention, and (3) position-ID mismatches.
While it is commonly assumed that the latter two mismatches require frequent
re-encoding, our analysis reveals that only the input-attention mismatch
significantly impacts performance, indicating re-encoding outputs is largely
unnecessary. To better understand this discrepancy with the common assumption,
we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the impact of position encoding
on LLMs in streaming, showing that preserving relative positions within source
and target contexts is more critical than maintaining absolute order. Motivated
by the above analysis, we introduce a group position encoding paradigm built on
batch architectures to enhance consistency between streaming and batch modes.
Extensive experiments on cross-lingual and cross-modal tasks demonstrate that
our method outperforms existing approaches. Our method requires no
architectural modifications, exhibits strong generalization in both streaming
and batch modes. The code is available at repository

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as

To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn
conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool
dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents'
ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain
and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both
short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as
deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating
research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating
the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by
T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex,

Motivation: 现有情感支持对话中，心理策略与响应内容的数据结构纠缠，导致偏好学习效果受限，亟需解耦优化方法。

Method: 引入IPM构建IPM-PrefDial数据集，并提出基于Gross情绪调节模型的两步解耦框架：策略规划与共情生成，分别通过SFT和DPO优化。

Result: 实验表明该框架优于联合优化基线，减少了偏好偏见并提升了响应质量。

Conclusion: 解耦框架和IPM方法有效解决了ESC任务中的数据纠缠和优化模糊问题，显著提升了情感支持对话的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) have improved
emotional support generation by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) via
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, common psychological errors still
persist. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) shows promise in reducing
such errors through pairwise preference learning, its effectiveness in ESC
tasks is limited by two key challenges: (1) Entangled data structure: Existing
ESC data inherently entangles psychological strategies and response content,
making it difficult to construct high-quality preference pairs; and (2)
Optimization ambiguity: Applying vanilla DPO to such entangled pairwise data
leads to ambiguous training objectives. To address these issues, we introduce
Inferential Preference Mining (IPM) to construct high-quality preference data,
forming the IPM-PrefDial dataset. Building upon this data, we propose a
Decoupled ESC framework inspired by Gross's Extended Process Model of Emotion
Regulation, which decomposes the ESC task into two sequential subtasks:
strategy planning and empathic response generation. Each was trained via SFT
and subsequently enhanced by DPO to align with the psychological preference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Decoupled ESC framework outperforms
joint optimization baselines, reducing preference bias and improving response
quality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to achieve breakthrough
performance on complex logical reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, most existing
research focuses on employing formal language to guide LLMs to derive reliable
reasoning paths, while systematic evaluations of these capabilities are still
limited. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs
across various logical reasoning problems utilizing formal languages. From the
perspective of three dimensions, i.e., spectrum of LLMs, taxonomy of tasks, and
format of trajectories, our key findings are: 1) Thinking models significantly
outperform Instruct models, especially when formal language is employed; 2) All
LLMs exhibit limitations in inductive reasoning capability, irrespective of
whether they use a formal language; 3) Data with PoT format achieves the best
generalization performance across other languages. Additionally, we also curate
the formal-relative training data to further enhance the small language models,
and the experimental results indicate that a simple rejected fine-tuning method
can better enable LLMs to generalize across formal languages and achieve the
best overall performance. Our codes and reports are available at

TL;DR: R1-Searcher++ 是一种新型框架，通过两阶段训练策略（SFT冷启动和RL动态知识获取）帮助LLM自适应利用内部和外部知识，优于现有RAG方法。

Motivation: LLMs易产生幻觉，现有RAG方法成本高、泛化差或忽略内部知识，需改进。

Method: 两阶段训练：SFT冷启动学习格式，RL动态知识获取结合奖励机制和记忆机制。

Result: R1-Searcher++优于现有RAG和推理方法，实现高效检索。

Conclusion: R1-Searcher++结合内外知识，持续提升模型能力，高效检索。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but prone to hallucinations due to
static knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting
external information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,
or ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce
R1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage
both internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage
training strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format
learning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses
outcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism
for internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to
continuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's
internal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search
engine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient
retrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++
outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient
retrieval. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可学习的图标记列表（LGTL）方法，以解决现有图标记学习模型（TGLMs）中手工设计标记列表对局部节点过度关注的问题，并在理论和实验上验证了其有效性。

Motivation: 现有的TGLMs依赖于手工设计的标记列表，这种设计存在对局部节点过度关注（hop-overpriority问题），尤其在异质性图中表现不佳，限制了模型的适应性和性能。

Method: 提出可学习的图标记列表（LGTL），通过图注意力门模块和选择模块自适应调整跳数间权重和优先选择信息丰富的节点，解决了手工设计标记列表的局限性。

Conclusion: LGTL作为一种即插即用模块，能够自适应地平衡局部和全局信息，解决了现有TGLMs的关键问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Transformers, leveraging the global attention to capture long-range
dependencies in graph structures, have significantly advanced graph machine
learning, but face prohibitive computational complexity. Tokenized Graph
Learning Models (TGLMs) address this issue by converting graphs into ordered
token lists for scalable processing. Besides, TGLMs also empower Large Language
Models (LLMs) to handle text-attributed graphs more effectively and thus are
also employed in Graph LLMs. However, existing TGLMs rely on hand-designed
token lists and their adaptability to diverse graph learning scenarios remains
unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct extensive empirical and theoretical
preliminary studies for hand-designed token lists. Surprisingly, we identify an
unexplored hop-overpriority problem: the common pre-defined token lists
overemphasize nearby nodes and overwhelm the ability of TGLMs to balance local
and global signals. This phenomenon is especially harmful for heterophilic
graphs. To address this problem, we propose the Learnable Graph Token List
(LGTL), a plug-and-play module to replace hand-designed token lists in TGLMs.
Specifically, LGTL adaptively adjusts the weights across hops and prioritizes
informative nodes within hops through a graph attention gate module and a
selection module, respectively. In this way, contextually informative nodes can
be adaptively emphasized for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Besides,
we theoretically show that LGTL can address the hop-overpriority problem.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the efficacy of LGTL across both
Graph Transformers and Graph LLM backbones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LLEB的新方法，通过可学习的先验分布（归一化流）来量化神经网络预测的不确定性，介于贝叶斯神经网络和深度集成方法之间。

Motivation: 量化神经网络预测的不确定性是人工智能中的关键挑战，现有的贝叶斯神经网络和深度集成方法各有优劣，论文希望通过结合两者的优点来改进不确定性量化。

Method: 提出LLEB方法，使用归一化流作为可学习的先验分布，并仅在最后一层应用以保持可操作性，通过最大化证据下界进行训练。

Result: LLEB在性能上与现有方法相当，显示出经验贝叶斯在不确定性量化中的潜力。

Conclusion: LLEB方法证明了经验贝叶斯是可以结合贝叶斯神经网络和深度集成优点的研究方向。

Abstract: The task of quantifying the inherent uncertainty associated with neural
network predictions is a key challenge in artificial intelligence. Bayesian
neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles are among the most prominent
approaches to tackle this task. Both approaches produce predictions by
computing an expectation of neural network outputs over some distribution on
the corresponding weights; this distribution is given by the posterior in the
case of BNNs, and by a mixture of point masses for ensembles. Inspired by
recent work showing that the distribution used by ensembles can be understood
as a posterior corresponding to a learned data-dependent prior, we propose last
layer empirical Bayes (LLEB). LLEB instantiates a learnable prior as a
normalizing flow, which is then trained to maximize the evidence lower bound;
to retain tractability we use the flow only on the last layer. We show why LLEB
is well motivated, and how it interpolates between standard BNNs and ensembles
in terms of the strength of the prior that they use. LLEB performs on par with
existing approaches, highlighting that empirical Bayes is a promising direction
for future research in uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: 本文反驳了RTN（Round-to-Nearest）量化方法在LLM中已被淘汰的观点，证明其成本更低、吞吐量更高且精度不逊于先进方法。

Motivation: 尽管RTN是一种简单的量化技术，但近期先进方法认为其性能不佳而被忽视。本文旨在证明RTN仍是量化LLM的可行选择。

Method: 基于Marlin内核实现RTN，并通过选择性提高某些模型层和模块的数据精度逐步提升准确性。

Result: RTN在token生成吞吐量上优于先进方法，且精度与之相似，同时应用成本更低。

Conclusion: RTN为LLM量化提供了实用且高效的选择。

Abstract: Quantization became a necessary tool for serving ever-increasing Large
Language Models (LLMs). RTN (Round-to-Nearest) is perhaps the simplest
quantization technique that has been around well before LLMs surged to the
forefront of machine learning (ML) research. Yet, it has been largely dismissed
by recent and more advanced quantization methods that claim superiority over
RTN in nearly every aspect of performance. This work aims to dispel this
established point of view, showing that RTN is not only much cheaper to apply,
but also its token generation throughput can be better than and accuracy can be
similar to more advanced alternatives. In particular, we discuss our
implementation of RTN based on the recent Marlin kernels and demonstrate how
the accuracy of RTN can be gradually improved by selectively increasing the
data precision format of certain model layers and modules. Based on our
results, we argue that RTN presents a viable and practical choice for
quantizing LLMs.

Conclusion: AllMetrics为机器学习工作流提供了一个可靠且可复现的评估工具。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models rely heavily on consistent and accurate
performance metrics to evaluate and compare their effectiveness. However,
existing libraries often suffer from fragmentation, inconsistent
implementations, and insufficient data validation protocols, leading to
unreliable results. Existing libraries have often been developed independently
and without adherence to a unified standard, particularly concerning the
specific tasks they aim to support. As a result, each library tends to adopt
its conventions for metric computation, input/output formatting, error
handling, and data validation protocols. This lack of standardization leads to
both implementation differences (ID) and reporting differences (RD), making it
difficult to compare results across frameworks or ensure reliable evaluations.
To address these issues, we introduce AllMetrics, an open-source unified Python
library designed to standardize metric evaluation across diverse ML tasks,
including regression, classification, clustering, segmentation, and
image-to-image translation. The library implements class-specific reporting for
multi-class tasks through configurable parameters to cover all use cases, while
incorporating task-specific parameters to resolve metric computation
discrepancies across implementations. Various datasets from domains like
healthcare, finance, and real estate were applied to our library and compared
with Python, Matlab, and R components to identify which yield similar results.
AllMetrics combines a modular Application Programming Interface (API) with
robust input validation mechanisms to ensure reproducibility and reliability in
model evaluation. This paper presents the design principles, architectural
components, and empirical analyses demonstrating the ability to mitigate
evaluation errors and to enhance the trustworthiness of ML workflows.

TL;DR: MoRE-Brain是一个结合脑网络层次结构的混合专家框架，用于高保真、可解释的视觉重建，通过动态路由机制实现跨被试泛化。

Motivation: 当前fMRI解码方法注重重建精度而忽视可解释性，限制了神经科学洞察力的获取。

Method: 采用层次化的混合专家架构，结合CLIP空间编码和扩散模型，通过双阶段路由机制动态整合专家输出。

Result: MoRE-Brain实现了高保真重建，并通过瓶颈分析验证了其对fMRI信号的有效利用。

Conclusion: MoRE-Brain为fMRI视觉解码提供了更通用和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand
human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However,
current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while
overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific
insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework
designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction.
MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture
where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel
groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to
encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then
synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing
mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion
process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a
novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for
neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by
sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers.
Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing
reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and
spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate
MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further
demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine
neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently,
MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and
interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon:

Abstract: We study identifiability of stochastic differential equation (SDE) models

unique recovery of SDE parameters given samples from their stationary
distributions. We give tight bounds on the number of necessary interventions

We experimentally validate the recovery of true parameters in synthetic data,
and motivated by our theoretical results, demonstrate the advantage of
parameterizations with learnable activation functions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）用于解释大型语言模型（LLMs）的内部激活，但其概念表示对输入扰动的鲁棒性被忽视。研究发现微小对抗性扰动能有效操纵SAE的解释，表明其概念表示脆弱，不适合模型监控和监管应用。

Motivation: 现有SAE评估忽略了概念表示对输入扰动的鲁棒性，而鲁棒性是概念表示可靠性的关键指标。

Method: 提出将鲁棒性量化为输入空间优化问题，并开发一个包含对抗性扰动操纵SAE表示的全面评估框架。

Result: 微小对抗性输入扰动可在不影响LLM输出的情况下操纵SAE的概念解释。

Conclusion: SAE概念表示脆弱，可能不适合用于模型监控和监管。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are commonly used to interpret the internal
activations of large language models (LLMs) by mapping them to
human-interpretable concept representations. While existing evaluations of SAEs
focus on metrics such as the reconstruction-sparsity tradeoff, human
(auto-)interpretability, and feature disentanglement, they overlook a critical
aspect: the robustness of concept representations to input perturbations. We
argue that robustness must be a fundamental consideration for concept
representations, reflecting the fidelity of concept labeling. To this end, we
formulate robustness quantification as input-space optimization problems and
develop a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring realistic scenarios in
which adversarial perturbations are crafted to manipulate SAE representations.
Empirically, we find that tiny adversarial input perturbations can effectively
manipulate concept-based interpretations in most scenarios without notably
affecting the outputs of the base LLMs themselves. Overall, our results suggest
that SAE concept representations are fragile and may be ill-suited for
applications in model monitoring and oversight.

Conclusion: 特征质量对OOD检测影响显著，GradPCA在理论和实验上均表现优越。

Abstract: We introduce GradPCA, an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection method that
exploits the low-rank structure of neural network gradients induced by Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) alignment. GradPCA applies Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) to gradient class-means, achieving more consistent performance than
existing methods across standard image classification benchmarks. We provide a
theoretical perspective on spectral OOD detection in neural networks to support
GradPCA, highlighting feature-space properties that enable effective detection
and naturally emerge from NTK alignment. Our analysis further reveals that
feature quality -- particularly the use of pretrained versus non-pretrained
representations -- plays a crucial role in determining which detectors will
succeed. Extensive experiments validate the strong performance of GradPCA, and
our theoretical framework offers guidance for designing more principled
spectral OOD detectors.

Result: 发现信号收缩现象及相变现象，为蒸馏策略优化提供理论和实践指导。

Conclusion: 研究增强了扩散轨迹蒸馏的理论理解，并为改进蒸馏策略提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Diffusion trajectory distillation methods aim to accelerate sampling in
diffusion models, which produce high-quality outputs but suffer from slow
sampling speeds. These methods train a student model to approximate the
multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step,
enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off
between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain
limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a
first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory
distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each
step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy
data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and
rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal
shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both
discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a
dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that
maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence
of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data
covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of
diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving
distillation strategies.

Conclusion: 该框架为Eikonal问题提供了高效的、几何基础扎实且可操控的解决方案，适用于多种黎曼流形。

Abstract: We introduce Equivariant Neural Eikonal Solvers, a novel framework that
integrates Equivariant Neural Fields (ENFs) with Neural Eikonal Solvers. Our
approach employs a single neural field where a unified shared backbone is
conditioned on signal-specific latent variables - represented as point clouds
in a Lie group - to model diverse Eikonal solutions. The ENF integration
ensures equivariant mapping from these latent representations to the solution
field, delivering three key benefits: enhanced representation efficiency
through weight-sharing, robust geometric grounding, and solution steerability.
This steerability allows transformations applied to the latent point cloud to
induce predictable, geometrically meaningful modifications in the resulting
Eikonal solution. By coupling these steerable representations with
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our framework accurately models
Eikonal travel-time solutions while generalizing to arbitrary Riemannian
manifolds with regular group actions. This includes homogeneous spaces such as
Euclidean, position-orientation, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds. We
validate our approach through applications in seismic travel-time modeling of
2D and 3D benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior
performance, scalability, adaptability, and user controllability compared to
existing Neural Operator-based Eikonal solver methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为组合优化中的启发式设计提供了新的数据驱动路径，优于基于专家监督的传统方法。

Abstract: Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are foundational to computer science,
yet their performance typically hinges on hand-crafted heuristics. This work
introduces Reinforcement Learning from Algorithm Feedback (RLAF) as a paradigm
for learning to guide SAT solver branching heuristics with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). Central to our approach is a novel and generic mechanism for
injecting inferred variable weights and polarities into the branching
heuristics of existing SAT solvers. In a single forward pass, a GNN assigns
these parameters to all variables. Casting this one-shot guidance as a
reinforcement learning problem lets us train the GNN with off-the-shelf
policy-gradient methods, such as GRPO, directly using the solver's
computational cost as the sole reward signal. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that RLAF-trained policies significantly reduce the mean solve times of
different base solvers across diverse SAT problem distributions, achieving more
than a 2x speedup in some cases, while generalizing effectively to larger and
harder problems after training. Notably, these policies consistently outperform
expert-supervised approaches based on learning handcrafted weighting
heuristics, offering a promising path towards data-driven heuristic design in
combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 研究稀疏激活专家模型（MoE）在资源受限设备上的高效部署问题，尤其是局部路由一致性的度量与优化。

Method: 提出两种指标：分段路由最佳性能（SRP）和分段缓存最佳命中率（SCH），用于量化MoE模型的局部路由一致性，并对20种不同架构的MoE LLM进行分析。

Conclusion: 研究为高效MoE设计和部署提供了方向，可在不牺牲推理速度的情况下优化内存使用。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
(LLMs) with sparsely activated experts during inference. To effectively deploy
large MoE models on memory-constrained devices, many systems introduce *expert
offloading* that caches a subset of experts in fast memory, leaving others on
slow memory to run on CPU or load on demand. While some research has exploited
the locality of expert activations, where consecutive tokens activate similar
experts, the degree of this **local routing consistency** varies across models
and remains understudied. In this paper, we propose two metrics to measure
local routing consistency of MoE models: (1) **Segment Routing Best Performance
(SRP)**, which evaluates how well a fixed group of experts can cover the needs
of a segment of tokens, and (2) **Segment Cache Best Hit Rate (SCH)**, which
measures the optimal segment-level cache hit rate under a given cache size
limit. We analyzed 20 MoE LLMs with diverse sizes and architectures and found
that models that apply MoE on every layer and do not use shared experts exhibit
the highest local routing consistency. We further showed that
domain-specialized experts contribute more to routing consistency than
vocabulary-specialized ones, and that most models can balance between cache
effectiveness and efficiency with cache sizes approximately 2x the active
experts. These findings pave the way for memory-efficient MoE design and
deployment without compromising inference speed. We publish the code for
replicating experiments at https://github.com/ljcleo/moe-lrc .

Conclusion: mesh-free SINDy是一种高效、鲁棒且易于实现的方法，适用于科学和工程中的多种问题。

Abstract: Identifying the governing equations of a dynamical system is one of the most
important tasks for scientific modeling. However, this procedure often requires
high-quality spatio-temporal data uniformly sampled on structured grids. In
this paper, we propose mesh-free SINDy, a novel algorithm which leverages the
power of neural network approximation as well as auto-differentiation to
identify governing equations from arbitrary sensor placements and non-uniform
temporal data sampling. We show that mesh-free SINDy is robust to high noise
levels and limited data while remaining computationally efficient. In our
implementation, the training procedure is straight-forward and nearly free of
hyperparameter tuning, making mesh-free SINDy widely applicable to many
scientific and engineering problems. In the experiments, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on a series of PDEs including the Burgers' equation, the heat
equation, the Korteweg-De Vries equation and the 2D advection-diffusion
equation. We conduct detailed numerical experiments on all datasets, varying
the noise levels and number of samples, and we also compare our approach to
previous state-of-the-art methods. It is noteworthy that, even in high-noise
and low-data scenarios, mesh-free SINDy demonstrates robust PDE discovery,
achieving successful identification with up to 75% noise for the Burgers'
equation using 5,000 samples and with as few as 100 samples and 1% noise. All
of this is achieved within a training time of under one minute.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为模型反馈学习（MFL）的新框架，用于在测试时优化预训练AI模型或已部署硬件系统的输入，无需重新训练或硬件修改。MFL通过轻量级反向模型迭代搜索最优输入，显著优于现有方法和人类专家。

Motivation: 现实世界中的许多场景（如半导体制造）无法或不适合修改已部署的系统，因此需要一种无需重新训练或硬件修改的优化方法。

Method: MFL利用轻量级反向模型迭代优化输入，结合稳定性感知优化提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在半导体等离子刻蚀任务中，MFL仅需五次迭代即可生成目标配方，性能优于贝叶斯优化和人类专家。在其他领域（如化学过程和电子系统）也表现优异。

Conclusion: MFL为现实环境中的智能控制提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法。

Abstract: We introduce Model Feedback Learning (MFL), a novel test-time optimization
framework for optimizing inputs to pre-trained AI models or deployed hardware
systems without requiring any retraining of the models or modifications to the
hardware. In contrast to existing methods that rely on adjusting model
parameters, MFL leverages a lightweight reverse model to iteratively search for
optimal inputs, enabling efficient adaptation to new objectives under
deployment constraints. This framework is particularly advantageous in
real-world settings, such as semiconductor manufacturing recipe generation,
where modifying deployed systems is often infeasible or cost-prohibitive. We
validate MFL on semiconductor plasma etching tasks, where it achieves target
recipe generation in just five iterations, significantly outperforming both
Bayesian optimization and human experts. Beyond semiconductor applications, MFL
also demonstrates strong performance in chemical processes (e.g., chemical
vapor deposition) and electronic systems (e.g., wire bonding), highlighting its
broad applicability. Additionally, MFL incorporates stability-aware
optimization, enhancing robustness to process variations and surpassing
conventional supervised learning and random search methods in high-dimensional
control settings. By enabling few-shot adaptation, MFL provides a scalable and
efficient paradigm for deploying intelligent control in real-world
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Merge to Mix的新方法，通过模型合并加速数据集混合的构建，无需对每个候选数据集进行全面微调。

Motivation: 构建高效数据集混合通常依赖启发式方法和试错，耗时长。Merge to Mix旨在加速这一过程。

Method: 利用模型合并技术，将多个单独微调的模型合并为一个模型，替代对整个混合数据集的微调。

Result: 实验表明，Merge to Mix在数据集选择方面的性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Merge to Mix是一种高效的工具，显著减少了构建数据集混合的时间和资源消耗。

Abstract: Mixing datasets for fine-tuning large models (LMs) has become critical for
maximizing performance on downstream tasks. However, composing effective
dataset mixtures typically relies on heuristics and trial-and-error, often
requiring multiple fine-tuning runs to achieve the desired outcome. We propose
a novel method, $\textit{Merge to Mix}$, that accelerates composing dataset
mixtures through model merging. Model merging is a recent technique that
combines the abilities of multiple individually fine-tuned LMs into a single LM
by using a few simple arithmetic operations. Our key insight is that merging
models individually fine-tuned on each dataset in a mixture can effectively
serve as a surrogate for a model fine-tuned on the entire mixture. Merge to Mix
leverages this insight to accelerate selecting dataset mixtures without
requiring full fine-tuning on each candidate mixture. Our experiments
demonstrate that Merge to Mix surpasses state-of-the-art methods in dataset
selection for fine-tuning LMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双向变分自编码器（BVAE），用单一神经网络实现编码和解码，参数减少50%，性能略优于传统VAE。

Motivation: 通过双向结构减少模型参数并提升性能。

Method: 使用单一神经网络，通过前向编码和后向解码实现图像任务。

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CelebA-64数据集上，BVAE参数减少50%，性能略优。

Conclusion: BVAE在减少参数的同时保持了性能优势。

Abstract: We present the new bidirectional variational autoencoder (BVAE) network
architecture. The BVAE uses a single neural network both to encode and decode
instead of an encoder-decoder network pair. The network encodes in the forward
direction and decodes in the backward direction through the same synaptic web.
Simulations compared BVAEs and ordinary VAEs on the four image tasks of image
reconstruction, classification, interpolation, and generation. The image
datasets included MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CelebA-64 face images. The bidirectional structure of BVAEs cut the parameter

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过集成多个稀疏自编码器（SAE）来提高特征重建和多样性，并在下游任务中表现优于单一SAE。

Motivation: 单一SAE只能捕获激活空间中的有限特征子集，不同初始化的SAE可以学习不同特征，因此需要集成方法以提升性能。

Method: 采用简单的bagging和boosting方法集成多个SAE（Bagging：不同权重初始化的SAE；Boosting：逐步最小化残差的SAE），并在不同语言模型和SAE架构下评估。

Result: 集成SAE能改善语言模型激活的重建、特征多样性和稳定性，且在下游任务（如概念检测和伪相关消除）中表现更优。

Conclusion: 集成SAE是一种有效的方法，能够提升SAE的整体性能和实用性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into human-interpretable features. Typically, features learned by a single SAE
are used for downstream applications. However, it has recently been shown that
SAEs trained with different initial weights can learn different features,
demonstrating that a single SAE captures only a limited subset of features that
can be extracted from the activation space. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose to ensemble multiple SAEs through naive bagging and boosting.
Specifically, SAEs trained with different weight initializations are ensembled
in naive bagging, whereas SAEs sequentially trained to minimize the residual
error are ensembled in boosting. We evaluate our ensemble approaches with three
settings of language models and SAE architectures. Our empirical results
demonstrate that ensembling SAEs can improve the reconstruction of language
model activations, diversity of features, and SAE stability. Furthermore,
ensembling SAEs performs better than applying a single SAE on downstream tasks
such as concept detection and spurious correlation removal, showing improved
practical utility.

TL;DR: FR-Mamba是一种新型时空流场重构框架，结合FNO和SSM，用于解决物理场重构中长期时间依赖问题。

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以捕捉长期时间依赖性，导致在时间演化物理系统中表现不佳。

Result: 实验表明，FR-Mamba在流场重构任务中显著优于现有方法，尤其在长序列上表现优异。

Conclusion: FR-Mamba通过结合时空特征建模，实现了高精度的物理场重构。

Abstract: Physical field reconstruction (PFR) aims to predict the state distribution of
physical quantities (e.g., velocity, pressure, and temperature) based on
limited sensor measurements. It plays a critical role in domains such as fluid
dynamics and thermodynamics. However, existing deep learning methods often fail
to capture long-range temporal dependencies, resulting in suboptimal
performance on time-evolving physical systems. To address this, we propose
FR-Mamba, a novel spatiotemporal flow field reconstruction framework based on
state space modeling. Specifically, we design a hybrid neural network
architecture that combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and State Space Model
(SSM) to capture both global spatial features and long-range temporal
dependencies. We adopt Mamba, a recently proposed efficient SSM architecture,
to model long-range temporal dependencies with linear time complexity. In
parallel, the FNO is employed to capture non-local spatial features by
leveraging frequency-domain transformations. The spatiotemporal representations
extracted by these two components are then fused to reconstruct the full-field
distribution of the physical system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing PFR methods in flow field
reconstruction tasks, achieving high-accuracy performance on long sequences.

Conclusion: 强化学习在股市交易时间点选择中具有潜力。

Abstract: Much research has been done to analyze the stock market. After all, if one
can determine a pattern in the chaotic frenzy of transactions, then they could
make a hefty profit from capitalizing on these insights. As such, the goal of
our project was to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to determine the best time
to buy a stock within a given time frame. With only a few adjustments, our
model can be extended to identify the best time to sell a stock as well. In
order to use the format of free, real-world data to train the model, we define
our own Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. These two papers [5] [6] helped
us in formulating the state space and the reward system of our MDP problem. We
train a series of agents using Q-Learning, Q-Learning with linear function
approximation, and deep Q-Learning. In addition, we try to predict the stock
prices using machine learning regression and classification models. We then
compare our agents to see if they converge on a policy, and if so, which one
learned the best policy to maximize profit on the stock market.

Abstract: Keylogger detection involves monitoring for unusual system behaviors such as
delays between typing and character display, analyzing network traffic patterns
for data exfiltration. In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis for
keylogger detection with traditional machine learning models - SVC, Random
Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
and advanced ensemble methods including Stacking, Blending and Voting.
Moreover, feature selection approaches such as Information gain, Lasso L1 and
Fisher Score are thoroughly assessed to improve predictive performance and
lower computational complexity. The Keylogger Detection dataset from publicly
available Kaggle website is used in this project. In addition to accuracy-based
classification, this study implements the approach for model interpretation
using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques namely SHAP (Global) and LIME (Local) to
deliver finer explanations for how much each feature contributes in assisting
or hindering the detection process. To evaluate the models result, we have used
AUC score, sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy and F1 score. The best
performance was achieved by AdaBoost with 99.76% accuracy, F1 score of 0.99,
100% precision, 98.6% recall, 1.0 specificity and 0.99 of AUC that is
near-perfect classification with Fisher Score.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架，用于量化大型语言模型（LLM）与外部工具结合时的总体不确定性，以增强高风险应用中系统的可信度。

Motivation: 在高风险应用中（如医疗决策），LLM与外部工具的结合需要评估其响应的不确定性，以确保可靠性。现有方法未考虑到工具调用场景中的不确定性。

Method: 论文扩展了不确定性量化方法，将其应用于LLM和外部工具的联合预测中，并提出了高效近似方法，使其适用于实际应用。

Result: 在合成QA数据集和检索增强生成（RAG）系统上的实验表明，该框架能有效增强LLM系统的信任度，尤其是在外部工具必要的场景中。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了工具调用场景中的不确定性量化问题，为LLM系统的可靠性提供了新方法。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) often require external tools, such as
machine learning classifiers or knowledge retrieval systems, to provide
accurate answers in domains where their pre-trained knowledge is insufficient.
This integration of LLMs with external tools expands their utility but also
introduces a critical challenge: determining the trustworthiness of responses
generated by the combined system. In high-stakes applications, such as medical
decision-making, it is essential to assess the uncertainty of both the LLM's
generated text and the tool's output to ensure the reliability of the final
response. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods do not account
for the tool-calling scenario, where both the LLM and external tool contribute
to the overall system's uncertainty. In this work, we present a novel framework
for modeling tool-calling LLMs that quantifies uncertainty by jointly
considering the predictive uncertainty of the LLM and the external tool. We
extend previous methods for uncertainty quantification over token sequences to
this setting and propose efficient approximations that make uncertainty
computation practical for real-world applications. We evaluate our framework on
two new synthetic QA datasets, derived from well-known machine learning
datasets, which require tool-calling for accurate answers. Additionally, we
apply our method to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and conduct a
proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the effectiveness of our uncertainty
metrics in scenarios where external information retrieval is needed. Our
results show that the framework is effective in enhancing trust in LLM-based
systems, especially in cases where the LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient
and external tools are required.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于共形预测的公平性概念（Conformal Fairness），并通过理论和算法框架控制敏感群体间的覆盖率差距，适用于非独立同分布数据（如图数据）。

Motivation: 共形预测（CP）在不确定性量化中广泛应用，但其对敏感属性的公平性问题未作解决，因此需要一种新方法填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了Conformal Fairness的概念和算法框架，利用共形预测的交换性假设，而非传统的独立同分布假设。

Result: 在图数据和表格数据上的实验表明，算法能有效控制公平性差距和覆盖率，符合理论预期。

Conclusion: Conformal Fairness为共形预测提供了一种公平性保障的解决方案，适用于更广泛的数据类型。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
with machine learning models. While conformal prediction provides probabilistic
guarantees regarding the coverage of the true label, these guarantees are
agnostic to the presence of sensitive attributes within the dataset. In this
work, we formalize \textit{Conformal Fairness}, a notion of fairness using
conformal predictors, and provide a theoretically well-founded algorithm and
associated framework to control for the gaps in coverage between different
sensitive groups. Our framework leverages the exchangeability assumption
(implicit to CP) rather than the typical IID assumption, allowing us to apply
the notion of Conformal Fairness to data types and tasks that are not IID, such
as graph data. Experiments were conducted on graph and tabular datasets to
demonstrate that the algorithm can control fairness-related gaps in addition to
coverage aligned with theoretical expectations.

TL;DR: 该论文指出大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理时存在计算效率低下的问题，提出了一种名为Plan-and-Budget的框架，通过动态分配token预算来提高效率。

Motivation: 许多流行的LLMs在推理时存在过度思考的问题，导致生成冗余和不相关的推理过程。固定token预算的方法又可能导致对复杂问题的思考不足，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了BBAM理论模型，并通过$E^3$指标衡量正确性和计算效率的平衡。基于此，开发了Plan-and-Budget框架，动态分解问题并分配token预算。

Result: Plan-and-Budget显著提升了推理效率，准确率提升高达70%，token减少39%，$E^3$指标提升187.5%。小模型通过该框架能匹配大模型的性能。

Conclusion: Plan-and-Budget为LLMs提供了一种高效的推理框架，无需重新训练即可显著提升性能和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in complex
reasoning tasks, but their inference remains computationally inefficient. We
observe a common failure mode in many prevalent LLMs, overthinking, where
models generate verbose and tangential reasoning traces even for simple
queries. Recent works have tried to mitigate this by enforcing fixed token
budgets, however, this can lead to underthinking, especially on harder
problems. Through empirical analysis, we identify that this inefficiency often
stems from unclear problem-solving strategies. To formalize this, we develop a
theoretical model, BBAM (Bayesian Budget Allocation Model), which models
reasoning as a sequence of sub-questions with varying uncertainty, and
introduce the $E^3$ metric to capture the trade-off between correctness and
computation efficiency. Building on theoretical results from BBAM, we propose
Plan-and-Budget, a model-agnostic, test-time framework that decomposes complex
queries into sub-questions and allocates token budgets based on estimated
complexity using adaptive scheduling. Plan-and-Budget improves reasoning
efficiency across a range of tasks and models, achieving up to +70% accuracy
gains, -39% token reduction, and +187.5% improvement in $E^3$. Notably, it
elevates a smaller model (DS-Qwen-32B) to match the efficiency of a larger
model (DS-LLaMA-70B)-demonstrating Plan-and-Budget's ability to close
performance gaps without retraining. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于外推的框架，通过合成分布偏移增强环境多样性，解决IRM方法在有限环境和过参数化下的性能下降问题，实验证明其优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有IRM方法（如IRMv1）因对环境和过参数化敏感，性能不佳，无法超越经验风险最小化（ERM），需要更鲁棒的实现。

Method: 提出外推框架，通过合成分布偏移增强IRM惩罚项的环境多样性。

Result: 在合成和实际过参数化实验中，新方法优于现有IRM变体，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 外推框架可提升IRM方法在OOD泛化中的性能，尤其是面对有限环境和过参数化挑战。

Abstract: Invariant risk minimization (IRM) aims to enable out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization in deep learning by learning invariant representations. As IRM
poses an inherently challenging bi-level optimization problem, most existing
approaches -- including IRMv1 -- adopt penalty-based single-level
approximations. However, empirical studies consistently show that these methods
often fail to outperform well-tuned empirical risk minimization (ERM),
highlighting the need for more robust IRM implementations. This work
theoretically identifies a key limitation common to many IRM variants: their
penalty terms are highly sensitive to limited environment diversity and
over-parameterization, resulting in performance degradation. To address this
issue, a novel extrapolation-based framework is proposed that enhances
environmental diversity by augmenting the IRM penalty through synthetic
distributional shifts. Extensive experiments -- ranging from synthetic setups
to realistic, over-parameterized scenarios -- demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IRM variants, validating its
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM)，一种基于Transformer的生成式预训练框架，旨在解决传统图神经网络（GNN）消息传递机制的表达能力有限、过度平滑等问题。

Motivation: 传统GNN因消息传递机制存在表达力受限、对长程依赖建模能力差等问题，难以扩展为图基础模型的骨干网络。

Method: 提出G$^2$PM，将图实例编码为子结构序列，并通过生成式预训练学习通用、可迁移的表示。

Result: 在ogbn-arxiv基准测试中，G$^2$PM在模型规模达6000万参数时仍持续改进，优于其他生成式方法（如规模仅为300万时即停滞）。

Conclusion: G$^2$PM在多任务中表现优异，为可扩展的图学习提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) has been predominantly driven by
message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local
neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from
fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness,
over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range
dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model
size often fails to yield improved performance, limiting the viability of GNNs
as backbones for graph foundation models. In this work, we explore pathways
beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine
(G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM
represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of
substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn
generalizable, transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates
strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with
model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches
that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we
systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural
choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse
tasks -- including node classification, graph classification, and transfer
learning -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a
compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are

Conclusion: MMO-FL和PMM为动态及去中心化的多模态学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem generates vast amounts of multimodal
data from heterogeneous sources such as sensors, cameras, and microphones. As
edge intelligence continues to evolve, IoT devices have progressed from simple
data collection units to nodes capable of executing complex computational
tasks. This evolution necessitates the adoption of distributed learning
strategies to effectively handle multimodal data in an IoT environment.
Furthermore, the real-time nature of data collection and limited local storage
on edge devices in IoT call for an online learning paradigm. To address these
challenges, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Online Federated Learning
(MMO-FL), a novel framework designed for dynamic and decentralized multimodal
learning in IoT environments. Building on this framework, we further account
for the inherent instability of edge devices, which frequently results in
missing modalities during the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive
theoretical analysis under both complete and missing modality scenarios,
providing insights into the performance degradation caused by missing
modalities. To mitigate the impact of modality missing, we propose the
Prototypical Modality Mitigation (PMM) algorithm, which leverages prototype
learning to effectively compensate for missing modalities. Experimental results
on two multimodal datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of PMM
compared to benchmarks.

Abstract: Model merging offers a training-free alternative to multi-task learning by
combining independently fine-tuned models into a unified one without access to
raw data. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics to determine
the merging coefficients, limiting their scalability and generality. In this
work, we revisit model merging through the lens of least-squares optimization
and show that the optimal merging weights should scale with the amount of
task-specific information encoded in each model. Based on this insight, we
propose NAN, a simple yet effective method that estimates model merging
coefficients via the inverse of parameter norm. NAN is training-free,
plug-and-play, and applicable to a wide range of merging strategies. Extensive
experiments on show that NAN consistently improves performance of baseline
methods.

Abstract: Learning from inaccurate annotations has gained significant attention due to
the high cost of precise labeling. However, despite the presence of erroneous
labels, models trained on noisy data often retain the ability to make accurate
predictions. This intriguing phenomenon raises a fundamental yet largely
unexplored question: why models can still extract correct label information
from inaccurate annotations remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive investigation into this issue. By analyzing weight matrices from
both empirical and theoretical perspectives, we find that label inaccuracy
primarily accumulates noise in lower singular components and subtly perturbs
the principal subspace. Within a certain range, the principal subspaces of
weights trained on inaccurate labels remain largely aligned with those learned
from clean labels, preserving essential task-relevant information. We formally
prove that the angles of principal subspaces exhibit minimal deviation under
moderate label inaccuracy, explaining why models can still generalize
effectively. Building on these insights, we propose LIP, a lightweight plug-in
designed to help classifiers retain principal subspace information while
mitigating noise induced by label inaccuracy. Extensive experiments on tasks
with various inaccuracy conditions demonstrate that LIP consistently enhances
the performance of existing algorithms. We hope our findings can offer valuable
theoretical and practical insights to understand of model robustness under
inaccurate supervision.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) holds great promise for digital health by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising patient data privacy.
However, heterogeneity across institutions, lack of sustained reputation, and
unreliable contributions remain major challenges. In this paper, we propose a
robust, peer-driven reputation mechanism for federated healthcare that employs
a hybrid communication model to integrate decentralized peer feedback with
clustering-based noise handling to enhance model aggregation. Crucially, our
approach decouples the federated aggregation and reputation mechanisms by
applying differential privacy to client-side model updates before sharing them
for peer evaluation. This ensures sensitive information remains protected
during reputation computation, while unaltered updates are sent to the server
for global model training. Using the Cox Proportional Hazards model for
survival analysis across multiple federated nodes, our framework addresses both
data heterogeneity and reputation deficit by dynamically adjusting trust scores
based on local performance improvements measured via the concordance index.
Experimental evaluations on both synthetic datasets and the SEER dataset
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high and stable C-index
values, effectively down-weighing noisy client updates and outperforming FL
methods that lack a reputation system.

Motivation: 解决LLM推理过程中由于KV缓存导致的内存资源消耗问题，进一步降低量化位数以减少空间占用。

Method: 分析KV缓存的元素分布，设计NQKV算法，采用每块的分位数量化以实现信息理论上的最优量化误差。

Result: 在不显著影响模型输出质量的情况下，NQKV使OPT模型的推理性能提升了9.3倍，支持更大的批处理规模或更长的上下文长度。

Conclusion: NQKV算法通过优化量化方法，有效解决了KV缓存的内存瓶颈问题，提升了LLM的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across
a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs often require larger batch sizes to
enhance throughput or longer context lengths to meet task demands, which
significantly increases the memory resource consumption of the Key-Value (KV)
cache during inference, becoming a major bottleneck in LLM deployment. To
address this issue, quantization is a common and straightforward approach.
Currently, quantization methods for activations are limited to 8-bit, and
quantization to even lower bits can lead to substantial accuracy drops. To
further save space by quantizing the KV cache to even lower bits, we analyzed
the element distribution of the KV cache and designed the NQKV algorithm. Since
the elements within each block of the KV cache follow a normal distribution,
NQKV employs per-block quantile quantization to achieve
information-theoretically optimal quantization error. Without significantly
compromising model output quality, NQKV enables the OPT model to perform
inference with an 2x larger batch size or a 4x longer context length, and it
improves throughput by 9.3x compared to when the KV cache is not used.

Result: 实验表明，DR在奖励塑造、选项发现、探索和迁移学习中表现优于SR。

Conclusion: DR不仅在理论上更完备，且在实际应用中展现了更好的性能和不同的行为特性。

Abstract: In recent years, the successor representation (SR) has attracted increasing
attention in reinforcement learning (RL), and it has been used to address some
of its key challenges, such as exploration, credit assignment, and
generalization. The SR can be seen as representing the underlying credit
assignment structure of the environment by implicitly encoding its induced
transition dynamics. However, the SR is reward-agnostic. In this paper, we
discuss a similar representation that also takes into account the reward
dynamics of the problem. We study the default representation (DR), a recently
proposed representation with limited theoretical (and empirical) analysis.
Here, we lay some of the theoretical foundation underlying the DR in the
tabular case by (1) deriving dynamic programming and (2) temporal-difference
methods to learn the DR, (3) characterizing the basis for the vector space of
the DR, and (4) formally extending the DR to the function approximation case
through default features. Empirically, we analyze the benefits of the DR in
many of the settings in which the SR has been applied, including (1) reward
shaping, (2) option discovery, (3) exploration, and (4) transfer learning. Our
results show that, compared to the SR, the DR gives rise to qualitatively
different, reward-aware behaviour and quantitatively better performance in
several settings.

Result: TabPFN v2在小规模、协变量偏移和类别平衡任务中表现良好，但在开放环境中总体受限。

Conclusion: 树模型仍是开放环境下表格任务的优选，建议未来研究关注开放环境基准和多指标评估。

Abstract: Tabular data, owing to its ubiquitous presence in real-world domains, has
garnered significant attention in machine learning research. While tree-based
models have long dominated tabular machine learning tasks, the recently
proposed deep learning model TabPFN v2 has emerged, demonstrating unparalleled
performance and scalability potential. Although extensive research has been
conducted on TabPFN v2 to further improve performance, the majority of this
research remains confined to closed environments, neglecting the challenges
that frequently arise in open environments. This raises the question: Can
TabPFN v2 maintain good performance in open environments? To this end, we
conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of TabPFN v2's adaptability in open
environments. We construct a unified evaluation framework covering various
real-world challenges and assess the robustness of TabPFN v2 under open
environments scenarios using this framework. Empirical results demonstrate that
TabPFN v2 shows significant limitations in open environments but is suitable
for small-scale, covariate-shifted, and class-balanced tasks. Tree-based models
remain the optimal choice for general tabular tasks in open environments. To
facilitate future research on open environments challenges, we advocate for
open environments tabular benchmarks, multi-metric evaluation, and universal
modules to strengthen model robustness. We publicly release our evaluation
framework at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/tabpfn-ood-4E65.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于模型的安全离线强化学习框架OGSRL，通过双重约束机制解决医疗场景中OOD问题的安全性和可靠性。

Motivation: 医疗场景中的离线强化学习存在OOD问题，可能导致有害推荐，现有方法仅约束动作选择，无法调控长期状态轨迹。

Method: 提出了OGSRL框架，包括一个OOD守护机制和一个安全性成本约束，前者限制政策探索在临床验证区域内，后者编码医疗知识确保生理安全边界。

Result: OGSRL在理论上保证了安全性和接近最优性能，政策在可靠区域内运行。

Conclusion: OGSRL能够安全地改进政策，同时确保状态动作轨迹符合临床规范。

Abstract: When applying offline reinforcement learning (RL) in healthcare scenarios,
the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues pose significant risks, as inappropriate
generalization beyond clinical expertise can result in potentially harmful
recommendations. While existing methods like conservative Q-learning (CQL)
attempt to address the OOD issue, their effectiveness is limited by only
constraining action selection by suppressing uncertain actions. This
action-only regularization imitates clinician actions that prioritize
short-term rewards, but it fails to regulate downstream state trajectories,
thereby limiting the discovery of improved long-term treatment strategies. To
safely improve policy beyond clinician recommendations while ensuring that
state-action trajectories remain in-distribution, we propose \textit{Offline
Guarded Safe Reinforcement Learning} ($\mathsf{OGSRL}$), a theoretically
grounded model-based offline RL framework. $\mathsf{OGSRL}$ introduces a novel
dual constraint mechanism for improving policy with reliability and safety.
First, the OOD guardian is established to specify clinically validated regions
for safe policy exploration. By constraining optimization within these regions,
it enables the reliable exploration of treatment strategies that outperform
clinician behavior by leveraging the full patient state history, without
drifting into unsupported state-action trajectories. Second, we introduce a
safety cost constraint that encodes medical knowledge about physiological
safety boundaries, providing domain-specific safeguards even in areas where
training data might contain potentially unsafe interventions. Notably, we
provide theoretical guarantees on safety and near-optimality: policies that
satisfy these constraints remain in safe and reliable regions and achieve
performance close to the best possible policy supported by the data.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of multi-node perception and delayed
scheduling response in distributed systems by proposing a GNN-based multi-node
collaborative perception mechanism. The system is modeled as a graph structure.
Message-passing and state-update modules are introduced. A multi-layer graph
neural network is constructed to enable efficient information aggregation and
dynamic state inference among nodes. In addition, a perception representation
method is designed by fusing local states with global features. This improves
each node's ability to perceive the overall system status. The proposed method
is evaluated within a customized experimental framework. A dataset featuring
heterogeneous task loads and dynamic communication topologies is used.
Performance is measured in terms of task completion rate, average latency, load
balancing, and transmission efficiency. Experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms mainstream algorithms under various conditions,
including limited bandwidth and dynamic structural changes. It demonstrates
superior perception capabilities and cooperative scheduling performance. The
model achieves rapid convergence and efficient responses to complex system
states.

Abstract: Choice of training data distribution greatly influences model behavior. Yet,
in large-scale settings, precisely characterizing how changes in training data
affects predictions is often difficult due to model training costs. Current
practice is to instead extrapolate from scaled down, inexpensive-to-train proxy
models. However, changes in data do not influence smaller and larger models
identically. Therefore, understanding how choice of data affects large-scale
models raises the question: how does training data distribution influence model
behavior across compute scale? We find that small- and large-scale language
model predictions (generally) do highly correlate across choice of training
data. Equipped with these findings, we characterize how proxy scale affects
effectiveness in two downstream proxy model applications: data attribution and
dataset selection.

Motivation: 传统Bradley-Terry奖励模型（BT RM）在数据规模覆盖和奖励攻击方面存在不足，而现有生成奖励模型（GenRM）的浅层推理能力有限且不支持成对偏好输入。为了解决这些问题，研究者提出了Think-RM。

Method: 通过监督微调（SFT）和基于规则的强化学习（RL）训练模型的长时推理能力，并提出成对RLHF流程，直接优化策略。

Result: Think-RM在RM-Bench上表现优于BT RM和垂直扩展的GenRM 8%，结合成对RLHF流程在策略性能上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Think-RM通过自引导推理和成对RLHF流程，显著提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性和策略性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a powerful
post-training paradigm for aligning large language models with human
preferences. A core challenge in RLHF is constructing accurate reward signals,
where the conventional Bradley-Terry reward models (BT RMs) often suffer from
sensitivity to data size and coverage, as well as vulnerability to reward
hacking. Generative reward models (GenRMs) offer a more robust alternative by
generating chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales followed by a final reward.
However, existing GenRMs rely on shallow, vertically scaled reasoning, limiting
their capacity to handle nuanced or complex (e.g., reasoning-intensive) tasks.
Moreover, their pairwise preference outputs are incompatible with standard RLHF
algorithms that require pointwise reward signals. In this work, we introduce
Think-RM, a training framework that enables long-horizon reasoning in GenRMs by
modeling an internal thinking process. Rather than producing structured,
externally provided rationales, Think-RM generates flexible, self-guided
reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection,
hypothetical reasoning, and divergent reasoning. To elicit these reasoning
abilities, we first warm-up the models by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over
long CoT data. We then further improve the model's long-horizon abilities by
rule-based reinforcement learning (RL). In addition, we propose a novel
pairwise RLHF pipeline that directly optimizes policies using pairwise
preference rewards, eliminating the need for pointwise reward conversion and
enabling more effective use of Think-RM outputs. Experiments show that Think-RM
achieves state-of-the-art results on RM-Bench, outperforming both BT RM and
vertically scaled GenRM by 8%. When combined with our pairwise RLHF pipeline,
it demonstrates superior end-policy performance compared to traditional
approaches.

Result: 发现大权重是避免层崩溃的关键，跳连不足以解决问题，注意力机制的二次计算时间不可避免。

Conclusion: 在表达能力强的Transformer中，使用大权重是必要的，跳连无法替代这一作用。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms lie at the heart of modern large language models (LLMs).
Straightforward algorithms for forward and backward (gradient) computation take
quadratic time, and a line of work initiated by [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2023]
and [Alman and Song NeurIPS 2024] has shown that quadratic time is necessary
unless the model weights are small, in which case almost linear time algorithms
are possible. In this paper, we show that large weights are necessary to avoid
a strong preclusion to representational strength we call layer collapse, which
means that the entire network can be approximated well by a network with only a
single layer. Thus, the quadratic running time of attention is unavoidable for
expressive transformers.
  The notion of layer collapse that we introduce is a variant on the notion of
rank collapse from the work of [Dong, Cordonnier, and Loukas ICML 2021]. They
showed that in Self Attention Networks with small weights and with skip
connections, rank collapse must occur. This is typically interpreted as
justifying the necessity of skip connections in expressive networks. However,
our result shows that even with skip connections, if the weights are small,
then layer collapse still occurs. Thus, only large weights, and not skip
connections, can prevent these representational weaknesses.

Abstract: Algorithmic fairness has emerged as a central issue in ML, and it has become
standard practice to adjust ML algorithms so that they will satisfy fairness
requirements such as Equal Opportunity. In this paper we consider the effects
of adopting such fair classifiers on the overall level of ecosystem fairness.
Specifically, we introduce the study of fairness with competing firms, and
demonstrate the failure of fair classifiers in yielding fair ecosystems. Our
results quantify the loss of fairness in systems, under a variety of
conditions, based on classifiers' correlation and the level of their data
overlap. We show that even if competing classifiers are individually fair, the
ecosystem's outcome may be unfair; and that adjusting biased algorithms to
improve their individual fairness may lead to an overall decline in ecosystem
fairness. In addition to these theoretical results, we also provide supporting
experimental evidence. Together, our model and results provide a novel and
essential call for action.

Conclusion: CP-GAMP是一种高效且可扩展的贝叶斯张量分解方法。

Abstract: Tensor CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD) is a fundamental model for
tensor reconstruction. Although the Bayesian framework allows for principled
uncertainty quantification and automatic hyperparameter learning, existing
methods do not scale well for large tensors because of high-dimensional matrix
inversions. To this end, we introduce CP-GAMP, a scalable Bayesian CPD
algorithm. This algorithm leverages generalized approximate message passing
(GAMP) to avoid matrix inversions and incorporates an expectation-maximization
routine to jointly infer the tensor rank and noise power. Through multiple
experiments, for synthetic 100x100x100 rank 20 tensors with only 20% elements
observed, the proposed algorithm reduces runtime by 82.7% compared to the
state-of-the-art variational Bayesian CPD method, while maintaining comparable
reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Most existing multivariate time series forecasting methods adopt an
all-to-all paradigm that feeds all variable histories into a unified model to
predict their future values without distinguishing their individual roles.
However, this undifferentiated paradigm makes it difficult to identify
variable-specific causal influences and often entangles causally relevant
information with spurious correlations. To address this limitation, we propose
an all-to-one forecasting paradigm that predicts each target variable
separately. Specifically, we first construct a Structural Causal Model from
observational data and then, for each target variable, we partition the
historical sequence into four sub-segments according to the inferred causal
structure: endogenous, direct causal, collider causal, and spurious
correlation. The prediction relies solely on the first three causally relevant
sub-segments, while the spurious correlation sub-segment is excluded.
Furthermore, we propose Causal Informed Transformer (CAIFormer), a novel
forecasting model comprising three components: Endogenous Sub-segment
Prediction Block, Direct Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, and Collider
Causal Sub-segment Prediction Block, which process the endogenous, direct
causal, and collider causal sub-segments, respectively. Their outputs are then
combined to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAIFormer.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了第一个大规模基准数据集FreshRetailNet-50K，用于解决零售业中因缺货导致的销售数据截断问题，通过两阶段需求建模方法显著提高了需求预测的准确性和减少了系统偏差。

Motivation: 零售业中精确的需求估计对库存和定价策略至关重要，但缺货期间的数据截断问题导致需求估计存在系统性偏差，现有数据集缺乏解决这一问题的时序分辨率和标注信息。

Method: 提出了FreshRetailNet-50K数据集，包含50,000条门店-产品时序数据，每小时销售记录和标注的缺货事件；采用两阶段需求建模方法：首先通过精确的每小时标注重建缺货期间的潜在需求，然后利用恢复的需求训练鲁棒的需求预测模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法使预测准确性提高了2.73%，并将系统性需求低估从7.37%降低到接近零偏差。

Conclusion: FreshRetailNet-50K以其高时间粒度和丰富的现实信息，为需求填补、易腐库存优化和因果零售分析开辟了新研究方向，解决了零售AI中长期存在的限制。

Abstract: Accurate demand estimation is critical for the retail business in guiding the
inventory and pricing policies of perishable products. However, it faces
fundamental challenges from censored sales data during stockouts, where
unobserved demand creates systemic policy biases. Existing datasets lack the
temporal resolution and annotations needed to address this censoring effect. To
fill this gap, we present FreshRetailNet-50K, the first large-scale benchmark
for censored demand estimation. It comprises 50,000 store-product time series
of detailed hourly sales data from 898 stores in 18 major cities, encompassing
863 perishable SKUs meticulously annotated for stockout events. The hourly
stock status records unique to this dataset, combined with rich contextual
covariates, including promotional discounts, precipitation, and temporal
features, enable innovative research beyond existing solutions. We demonstrate
one such use case of two-stage demand modeling: first, we reconstruct the
latent demand during stockouts using precise hourly annotations. We then
leverage the recovered demand to train robust demand forecasting models in the
second stage. Experimental results show that this approach achieves a 2.73\%
improvement in prediction accuracy while reducing the systematic demand
underestimation from 7.37\% to near-zero bias. With unprecedented temporal
granularity and comprehensive real-world information, FreshRetailNet-50K opens
new research directions in demand imputation, perishable inventory
optimization, and causal retail analytics. The unique annotation quality and
scale of the dataset address long-standing limitations in retail AI, providing
immediate solutions and a platform for future methodological innovation. The
data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Dingdong-Inc/FreshRetailNet-50K) and code
(https://github.com/Dingdong-Inc/frn-50k-baseline}) are openly released.

TL;DR: AdaSTaR（自适应STaR）通过两种自适应采样原则（多样性和动态难度调整）解决了传统STaR算法中的训练不平衡问题，提升了模型的性能和训练效率。

Motivation: 传统STaR算法在随机采样数据时存在训练不平衡问题，即简单样本过度训练而困难样本训练不足，影响了模型的性能。

Method: 提出AdaSTaR算法，包含两种自适应采样原则：1) 多样性采样以平衡训练数据；2) 动态调整数据难度以匹配模型能力。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，AdaSTaR均取得最佳测试准确率（6/6），训练FLOPs平均减少58.6%，且结果可推广到不同规模的模型。

Conclusion: AdaSTaR为自改进语言模型提供了更高效和有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Self-Taught Reasoners (STaR), synonymously known as Rejection sampling
Fine-Tuning (RFT), is an integral part of the training pipeline of
self-improving reasoning Language Models (LMs). The self-improving mechanism
often employs random observation (data) sampling. However, this results in
trained observation imbalance; inefficiently over-training on solved examples
while under-training on challenging ones. In response, we introduce Adaptive
STaR (AdaSTaR), a novel algorithm that rectifies this by integrating two
adaptive sampling principles: (1) Adaptive Sampling for Diversity: promoting
balanced training across observations, and (2) Adaptive Sampling for
Curriculum: dynamically adjusting data difficulty to match the model's evolving
strength. Across six benchmarks, AdaSTaR achieves best test accuracy in all
instances (6/6) and reduces training FLOPs by an average of 58.6% against an
extensive list of baselines. These improvements in performance and efficiency
generalize to different pre-trained LMs and larger models, paving the way for
more efficient and effective self-improving LMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress in
many applications in recent years. However, chemical MLLMs that can handle
cross-modal understanding and generation remain underexplored. To fill this
gap, in this paper, we propose ChemMLLM, a unified chemical multimodal large
language model for molecule understanding and generation. Also, we design five
multimodal tasks across text, molecular SMILES strings, and image, and curate
the datasets. We benchmark ChemMLLM against a range of general leading MLLMs
and Chemical LLMs on these tasks. Experimental results show that ChemMLLM
achieves superior performance across all evaluated tasks. For example, in
molecule image optimization task, ChemMLLM outperforms the best baseline
(GPT-4o) by 118.9\% (4.27 vs 1.95 property improvement). The code is publicly

Motivation: 探索差分 Transformer 的成功机制，并解决其需要从头训练的问题，以利用预训练模型的潜力。

Method: 提出 DEX，通过复用 softmax 注意力分数并在输出值矩阵上添加轻量级差分操作，整合差分注意力的优势。

Result: DEX 在多种基准测试中显著提升了预训练 LLM 的性能，仅需极少的适应数据（< 0.01%）。

Conclusion: DEX 是一种高效整合差分注意力优势的轻量级方法，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Differential Transformer has recently gained significant attention for its
impressive empirical performance, often attributed to its ability to perform
noise canceled attention. However, precisely how differential attention
achieves its empirical benefits remains poorly understood. Moreover,
Differential Transformer architecture demands large-scale training from
scratch, hindering utilization of open pretrained weights. In this work, we
conduct an in-depth investigation of Differential Transformer, uncovering three
key factors behind its success: (1) enhanced expressivity via negative
attention, (2) reduced redundancy among attention heads, and (3) improved
learning dynamics. Based on these findings, we propose DEX, a novel method to
efficiently integrate the advantages of differential attention into pretrained
language models. By reusing the softmax attention scores and adding a
lightweight differential operation on the output value matrix, DEX effectively
incorporates the key advantages of differential attention while remaining
lightweight in both training and inference. Evaluations confirm that DEX
substantially improves the pretrained LLMs across diverse benchmarks, achieving
significant performance gains with minimal adaptation data (< 0.01\%).

TL;DR: CLEANMOL框架通过结构化任务提升LLMs对SMILES分子结构的理解能力，显著优于基线模型。

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）难以准确解析SMILES分子表示，亟需提升其对分子结构的理解能力。

Method: 提出CLEANMOL框架，将SMILES解析转化为结构化任务，通过子图匹配和全局图匹配任务增强模型理解能力。

Result: CLEANMOL显著提升模型对分子结构的理解，并在Mol-Instructions基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: CLEANMOL为SMILES解析提供了有效解决方案，推动了LLMs在分子科学中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized as powerful tools
for scientific discovery, particularly in molecular science. A fundamental
requirement for these models is the ability to accurately understand molecular
structures, commonly encoded in the SMILES representation. However, current
LLMs struggle to interpret SMILES, even failing to carry out basic tasks such
as counting molecular rings. To address this limitation, we introduce CLEANMOL,
a novel framework that formulates SMILES parsing into a suite of clean and
deterministic tasks explicitly designed to promote graph-level molecular
comprehension. These tasks span from subgraph matching to global graph
matching, providing structured supervision aligned with molecular structural
properties. We construct a molecular pretraining dataset with adaptive
difficulty scoring and pre-train open-source LLMs on these tasks. Our results
show that CLEANMOL not only enhances structural comprehension but also achieves
the best or competes with the baseline on the Mol-Instructions benchmark.

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用不同专家在不同样本区间（如头部、中部、尾部）的预测能力，且深层特征的分布偏差问题未被有效解决。

Method: 提出动态专家分配模块，根据样本的类别成员（头部、中部或尾部）动态选择合适专家生成伪标签；同时提出多深度特征融合模块，结合不同深度的特征以缓解模型偏差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、STL-10-LT和SVHN-LT数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文通过整合专家能力和多深度特征，显著提升了长尾半监督学习模型的性能。

Abstract: This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with
distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training
data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the
unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers
(experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce
pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We
observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of
samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head
interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval.
Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the
class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and
dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated
membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and
produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that
integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization
error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward
the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower
features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We,
therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different
depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its
effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT,
and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. The code is available at

Conclusion: 通过重新定义准可逆性并引入新策略，论文为优化广泛排队系统的性能提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a versatile scheme for optimizing the arrival
rates of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We first propose an alternative
definition of quasi-reversibility that encompasses reversibility and highlights
the importance of the definition of customer classes. In a second time, we
introduce balanced arrival control policies, which generalize the notion of
balanced arrival rates introduced in the context of Whittle networks, to the
much broader class of quasi-reversible queueing systems. We prove that
supplementing a quasi-reversible queueing system with a balanced
arrival-control policy preserves the quasi-reversibility, and we specify the
form of the stationary measures. We revisit two canonical examples of
quasi-reversible queueing systems, Whittle networks and order-independent
queues. Lastly, we focus on the problem of admission control and leverage our
results in the frameworks of optimization and reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdamS是一种简单高效的优化器替代方案，专为大型语言模型预训练和后训练设计，通过新颖的分母设计省去二阶矩估计，优于AdamW且易于部署。

Motivation: AdamS的提出源于Transformer目标函数中观察到的平滑性特性，动量大小可用于近似梯度大小。

Method: 利用动量和当前梯度的加权平方和作为分母，避免了二阶矩估计，保持了SGD的内存和计算效率。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama2等模型（高达130亿参数）的预训练及后训练强化学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: AdamS以高效性、简易性和理论支持，成为现有优化器的有力替代。

Abstract: We introduce AdamS, a simple yet effective alternative to Adam for large
language model (LLM) pretraining and post-training. By leveraging a novel
denominator, i.e., the root of weighted sum of squares of the momentum and the
current gradient, AdamS eliminates the need for second-moment estimates. Hence,
AdamS is efficient, matching the memory and compute footprint of SGD with
momentum while delivering superior optimization performance. Moreover, AdamS is
easy to adopt: it can directly inherit hyperparameters of AdamW, and is
entirely model-agnostic, integrating seamlessly into existing pipelines without
modifications to optimizer APIs or architectures. The motivation behind AdamS
stems from the observed $(L_0, L_1)$ smoothness properties in transformer
objectives, where local smoothness is governed by gradient magnitudes that can
be further approximated by momentum magnitudes. We establish rigorous
theoretical convergence guarantees and provide practical guidelines for
hyperparameter selection. Empirically, AdamS demonstrates strong performance in
various tasks, including pre-training runs on GPT-2 and Llama2 (up to 13B
parameters) and reinforcement learning in post-training regimes. With its
efficiency, simplicity, and theoretical grounding, AdamS stands as a compelling
alternative to existing optimizers.

Abstract: Developing new molecular compounds is crucial to address pressing challenges,
from health to environmental sustainability. However, exploring the molecular
space to discover new molecules is difficult due to the vastness of the space.
Here we introduce CoCoGraph, a collaborative and constrained graph diffusion
model capable of generating molecules that are guaranteed to be chemically
valid. Thanks to the constraints built into the model and to the collaborative
mechanism, CoCoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on standard
benchmarks while requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
Analysis of 36 chemical properties also demonstrates that CoCoGraph generates
molecules with distributions more closely matching real molecules than current
models. Leveraging the model's efficiency, we created a database of 8.2M
million synthetically generated molecules and conducted a Turing-like test with
organic chemistry experts to further assess the plausibility of the generated
molecules, and potential biases and limitations of CoCoGraph.

Abstract: How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question.
Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks)
suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human
annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2)
Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3)
Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control,
making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.
  To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework
that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLM
reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification,
and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline
that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks
of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable
training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.
  We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying
difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with
problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain
Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT
problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of
+14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B
and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g.,
AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in
constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We
release the source code, data, and models to support future research.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型日益复杂带来的可解释性和可重用性问题，同时弥补传统嵌入模型（如Word2Vec和GloVe）的透明性不足以及可解释模型（如Tsetlin Machine）的可扩展性和可重用性局限。

Method: 提出Omni TM-AE模型，充分利用Tsetlin Machine状态矩阵中的信息（包括之前被排除在子句形成之外的文字），通过单次训练构建可重用且可解释的嵌入。

Result: 在语义相似性、情感分类和文档聚类等任务上，Omni TM-AE表现优于主流嵌入模型，证明了其在性能、可扩展性和可解释性方面的平衡。

Conclusion: Omni TM-AE展示了在现代NLP系统中实现性能、可扩展性和可解释性平衡的可行性，无需依赖不透明的架构。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large-scale language models has amplified
concerns regarding their interpretability and reusability. While traditional
embedding models like Word2Vec and GloVe offer scalability, they lack
transparency and often behave as black boxes. Conversely, interpretable models
such as the Tsetlin Machine (TM) have shown promise in constructing explainable
learning systems, though they previously faced limitations in scalability and
reusability. In this paper, we introduce Omni Tsetlin Machine AutoEncoder (Omni
TM-AE), a novel embedding model that fully exploits the information contained
in the TM's state matrix, including literals previously excluded from clause
formation. This method enables the construction of reusable, interpretable
embeddings through a single training phase. Extensive experiments across
semantic similarity, sentiment classification, and document clustering tasks
show that Omni TM-AE performs competitively with and often surpasses mainstream
embedding models. These results demonstrate that it is possible to balance
performance, scalability, and interpretability in modern Natural Language
Processing (NLP) systems without resorting to opaque architectures.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for
reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models
remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as
DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are
often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more
effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that
large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong,
small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of
state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL
training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective
approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts.
Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the
performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% /
+17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks
(e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition,
extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks
with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data
curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable
answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains.
Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning
with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of
on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational
reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning
(e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning
ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

Motivation: 探索如何利用强化学习提升LLMs在多场景游戏中的泛化能力，克服规则多样性和环境复杂性带来的挑战。

Method: Divide-Fuse-Conquer框架：1）基于游戏规则和难度分组；2）为每组训练专用模型；3）融合不同组的模型参数并继续训练。

Result: 在18个TextArena游戏中，Qwen2.5-32B-Align达到了与Claude3.5相当的性能（7胜4平）。

Conclusion: Divide-Fuse-Conquer策略有效提升了多场景RL中的泛化能力，为未来研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been observed to suddenly exhibit advanced
reasoning abilities during reinforcement learning (RL), resembling an ``aha
moment'' triggered by simple outcome-based rewards. While RL has proven
effective in eliciting such breakthroughs in tasks involving mathematics,
coding, and vision, it faces significant challenges in multi-scenario games.
The diversity of game rules, interaction modes, and environmental complexities
often leads to policies that perform well in one scenario but fail to
generalize to others. Simply combining multiple scenarios during training
introduces additional challenges, such as training instability and poor
performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Divide-Fuse-Conquer, a
framework designed to enhance generalization in multi-scenario RL. This
approach starts by heuristically grouping games based on characteristics such
as rules and difficulties. Specialized models are then trained for each group
to excel at games in the group is what we refer to as the divide step. Next, we
fuse model parameters from different groups as a new model, and continue
training it for multiple groups, until the scenarios in all groups are
conquered. Experiments across 18 TextArena games show that Qwen2.5-32B-Align
trained with the Divide-Fuse-Conquer strategy reaches a performance level
comparable to Claude3.5, achieving 7 wins and 4 draws. We hope our approach can
inspire future research on using reinforcement learning to improve the
generalization of LLMs.

manipulate local data/models in a way that causes denial-of-service (DoS)
issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack method, named Federated
Learning Sliding Attack (FedSA) scheme, aiming at precisely introducing the
extent of poisoning in a subtle controlled manner. It operates with a
predefined objective, such as reducing global model's prediction accuracy by
10\%. FedSA integrates robust nonlinear control-Sliding Mode Control (SMC)
theory with model poisoning attacks. It can manipulate the updates from
malicious clients to drive the global model towards a compromised state,
achieving this at a controlled and inconspicuous rate. Additionally, leveraging
the robust control properties of FedSA allows precise control over the
convergence bounds, enabling the attacker to set the global accuracy of the
poisoned model to any desired level. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedSA can accurately achieve a predefined global accuracy with fewer malicious
clients while maintaining a high level of stealth and adjustable learning
rates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型的隐式越狱框架IJA，通过最低有效位隐写术将恶意指令嵌入图像，并结合看似无害的文本提示，以规避多模态大语言模型的安全机制。

Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的跨模态一致性增强，显式攻击容易被检测和阻止，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: IJA框架利用隐写术和对抗性后缀生成器，结合模板优化模块，迭代优化提示和嵌入。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5 Pro等商业模型上，攻击成功率超过90%，仅需平均3次查询。

Conclusion: IJA展示了MLLMs在隐式攻击下的脆弱性，强调了加强安全机制的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable powerful cross-modal
reasoning capabilities. However, the expanded input space introduces new attack
surfaces. Previous jailbreak attacks often inject malicious instructions from
text into less aligned modalities, such as vision. As MLLMs increasingly
incorporate cross-modal consistency and alignment mechanisms, such explicit
attacks become easier to detect and block. In this work, we propose a novel
implicit jailbreak framework termed IJA that stealthily embeds malicious
instructions into images via least significant bit steganography and couples
them with seemingly benign, image-related textual prompts. To further enhance
attack effectiveness across diverse MLLMs, we incorporate adversarial suffixes
generated by a surrogate model and introduce a template optimization module
that iteratively refines both the prompt and embedding based on model feedback.
On commercial models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, our method achieves attack
success rates of over 90% using an average of only 3 queries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于邻居驱动的近似策略，通过利用潜在空间的局部邻近性，实现了可扩展的高斯过程变分自编码器（GPVAE）推断。

Motivation: 标准的GPVAE在大规模数据上的精确推断计算成本过高，因此需要通过限制性核假设或大量诱导点来缓解问题。本文旨在通过局部邻近性解决这一限制。

Method: 采用邻居驱动的近似策略，将计算限制在每个数据点的最近邻，以保留潜在的依赖关系，支持更灵活的核选择并减少诱导点需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在表示学习、数据插补和条件生成等任务中，预测性能和计算效率均优于其他GPVAE变体。

Conclusion: 通过局部邻近性策略，可以高效且灵活地实现GPVAE推断，解决了大规模数据的计算难题。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) extend standard VAEs by
replacing the fully factorised Gaussian prior with a GP prior, thereby
capturing richer correlations among latent variables. However, performing exact
GP inference in large-scale GPVAEs is computationally prohibitive, often
forcing existing approaches to rely on restrictive kernel assumptions or large
sets of inducing points. In this work, we propose a neighbour-driven
approximation strategy that exploits local adjacencies in the latent space to
achieve scalable GPVAE inference. By confining computations to the nearest
neighbours of each data point, our method preserves essential latent
dependencies, allowing more flexible kernel choices and mitigating the need for
numerous inducing points. Through extensive experiments on tasks including
representation learning, data imputation, and conditional generation, we
demonstrate that our approach outperforms other GPVAE variants in both
predictive performance and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束NMF的主题模型，能够有效捕捉低流行度的少数主题（如心理健康内容），不需专家预设主题划分。

Motivation: 传统主题模型难以捕捉低流行度但领域关键的主题（少数主题），如心理健康评论，现有方法在指导信息过细时会限制主题发现。

Method: 通过种子词列表和流行度约束的NMF模型，结合KKT条件和乘法更新，学习少数与多数主题。

Result: 在合成数据上，模型在主题纯度、归一化互信息和JSD指标上优于基线；实际案例中成功识别了YouTube评论中的心理健康内容。

Conclusion: 该模型能有效发现少数主题，适合领域相关的低流行度内容分析。

Abstract: Topic models often fail to capture low-prevalence, domain-critical themes,
so-called minority topics, such as mental health themes in online comments.
While some existing methods can incorporate domain knowledge, such as expected
topical content, methods allowing guidance may require overly detailed expected
topics, hindering the discovery of topic divisions and variation. We propose a
topic modeling solution via a specially constrained NMF. We incorporate a seed
word list characterizing minority content of interest, but we do not require
experts to pre-specify their division across minority topics. Through
prevalence constraints on minority topics and seed word content across topics,
we learn distinct data-driven minority topics as well as majority topics. The
constrained NMF is fitted via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with
multiplicative updates. We outperform several baselines on synthetic data in
terms of topic purity, normalized mutual information, and also evaluate topic
quality using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD). We conduct a case study on
YouTube vlog comments, analyzing viewer discussion of mental health content;
our model successfully identifies and reveals this domain-relevant minority
content.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在数据包含丰富标签（如个体类型、排名或风险估计）时，公平性与效用和效率的交互关系。提出了实现更强证据公平性的算法，同时展示了一些计算上的不可能结果。

Motivation: 探索在数据标签更丰富的情况下如何实现公平性，并研究其与效用和效率的关系。

Method: 提出新的算法以实现证据公平性，支持分类和排名技术，同时分析计算困难性。

Result: 展示了算法在保持准确子群分类率和最小化损失方面的有效性，但也揭示了某些情况下同时满足两者的计算困难。

Conclusion: 公平性的不同定义在某些情况下无法同时实现，需要在自然且可实现的准确性概念之间做出选择。

Abstract: We revisit the foundations of fairness and its interplay with utility and
efficiency in settings where the training data contain richer labels, such as
individual types, rankings, or risk estimates, rather than just binary
outcomes. In this context, we propose algorithms that achieve stronger notions
of evidence-based fairness than are possible in standard supervised learning.
Our methods support classification and ranking techniques that preserve
accurate subpopulation classification rates, as suggested by the underlying
data distributions, across a broad class of classification rules and downstream
applications. Furthermore, our predictors enable loss minimization, whether
aimed at maximizing utility or in the service of fair treatment.
  Complementing our algorithmic contributions, we present impossibility results
demonstrating that simultaneously achieving accurate classification rates and
optimal loss minimization is, in some cases, computationally infeasible. Unlike
prior impossibility results, our notions are not inherently in conflict and are
simultaneously satisfied by the Bayes-optimal predictor. Furthermore, we show
that each notion can be satisfied individually via efficient learning. Our
separation thus stems from the computational hardness of learning a
sufficiently good approximation of the Bayes-optimal predictor. These
computational impossibilities present a choice between two natural and
attainable notions of accuracy that could both be motivated by fairness.

Motivation: 核方法虽功能强大但缺乏解释性，限制了其在高风险领域的应用。现有的Shapley值计算方法计算复杂度高，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 利用乘积核的可分解性，提出了PKeX-Shapley算法，递归计算Shapley值，并推广到MMD和HSIC等核统计差异的解释。

Result: PKeX-Shapley算法能高效精确地计算Shapley值，同时提升核模型的解释性和统计推理能力。

Conclusion: PKeX-Shapley为核方法提供了高效且解释性强的工具，适用于统计推断和机器学习应用。

Abstract: Kernel methods are widely used in machine learning due to their flexibility
and expressive power. However, their black-box nature poses significant
challenges to interpretability, limiting their adoption in high-stakes
applications. Shapley value-based feature attribution techniques, such as SHAP
and kernel-specific variants like RKHS-SHAP, offer a promising path toward
explainability. Yet, computing exact Shapley values remains computationally
intractable in general, motivating the development of various approximation
schemes. In this work, we introduce PKeX-Shapley, a novel algorithm that
utilizes the multiplicative structure of product kernels to enable the exact
computation of Shapley values in polynomial time. We show that product-kernel
models admit a functional decomposition that allows for a recursive formulation
of Shapley values. This decomposition not only yields computational efficiency
but also enhances interpretability in kernel-based learning. We also
demonstrate how our framework can be generalized to explain kernel-based
statistical discrepancies such as the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), thus offering new tools for
interpretable statistical inference.

Conclusion: GRDM提供了一种更灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于隐私保护和数据增强等应用。

Abstract: Building generative models for relational databases (RDBs) is important for
applications like privacy-preserving data release and augmenting real datasets.
However, most prior work either focuses on single-table generation or relies on
autoregressive factorizations that impose a fixed table order and generate
tables sequentially. This approach limits parallelism, restricts flexibility in
downstream applications like missing value imputation, and compounds errors due
to commonly made conditional independence assumptions. We propose a
fundamentally different approach: jointly modeling all tables in an RDB without
imposing any order. By using a natural graph representation of RDBs, we propose
the Graph-Conditional Relational Diffusion Model (GRDM). GRDM leverages a graph
neural network to jointly denoise row attributes and capture complex
inter-table dependencies. Extensive experiments on six real-world RDBs
demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms autoregressive
baselines in modeling multi-hop inter-table correlations and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on single-table fidelity metrics.

Abstract: Adaptation of foundation models using low-rank methods is a widespread
approach. Another way to adapt these models is to employ orthogonal fine-tuning
methods, which are less time and memory efficient despite their good
generalization properties. In this work, we propose Householder Orthogonal
Fine-tuning (HOFT), a novel orthogonal fine-tuning method that aims to
alleviate time and space complexity. Moreover, some theoretical properties of
the orthogonal fine-tuning paradigm are explored. From this exploration, Scaled
Householder Orthogonal Fine-tuning (SHOFT) is proposed. Both HOFT and SHOFT are
evaluated in downstream tasks, namely commonsense reasoning, machine
translation, subject-driven generation and mathematical reasoning. Compared

Conclusion: 通过时间一致性条件设计的新损失函数有效提升了增量序列分类的性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of incremental sequence classification, where
predictions are updated as new elements in the sequence are revealed. Drawing
on temporal-difference learning from reinforcement learning, we identify a
temporal-consistency condition that successive predictions should satisfy. We
leverage this condition to develop a novel loss function for training
incremental sequence classifiers. Through a concrete example, we demonstrate
that optimizing this loss can offer substantial gains in data efficiency. We
apply our method to text classification tasks and show that it improves
predictive accuracy over competing approaches on several benchmark datasets. We
further evaluate our approach on the task of verifying large language model
generations for correctness in grade-school math problems. Our results show
that models trained with our method are better able to distinguish promising
generations from unpromising ones after observing only a few tokens.

Result: 在多模型（如FitzHugh-Nagumo、Barkley反应扩散模型等）中验证了方法的有效性，实现了跨维度、坐标系、边界条件和曲率的无缝预测。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了偏微分方程学习的泛化能力，为跨空间应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: The machine learning methods for data-driven identification of partial
differential equations (PDEs) are typically defined for a given number of
spatial dimensions and a choice of coordinates the data have been collected in.
This dependence prevents the learned evolution equation from generalizing to
other spaces. In this work, we reformulate the problem in terms of coordinate-
and dimension-independent representations, paving the way toward what we call
``spatially liberated" PDE learning. To this end, we employ a machine learning
approach to predict the evolution of scalar field systems expressed in the
formalism of exterior calculus, which is coordinate-free and immediately
generalizes to arbitrary dimensions by construction. We demonstrate the
performance of this approach in the FitzHugh-Nagumo and Barkley
reaction-diffusion models, as well as the Patlak-Keller-Segel model informed by
in-situ chemotactic bacteria observations. We provide extensive numerical
experiments that demonstrate that our approach allows for seamless transitions
across various spatial contexts. We show that the field dynamics learned in one
space can be used to make accurate predictions in other spaces with different
dimensions, coordinate systems, boundary conditions, and curvatures.

Motivation: 边缘设备上的机器学习模型训练需求增长，但当前方法存在数据利用率低、存储有限和数据重要性多样等问题。

Method: Titan采用两阶段数据选择框架：粗粒度筛选候选数据集，细粒度选择最优数据批次，并通过流水线并行执行数据选择和训练。

Result: 实验表明，Titan显著减少训练时间（最高43%）并提高最终准确率（6.2%），且系统开销较小。

Conclusion: Titan有效解决了边缘设备上的数据利用问题，提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: The demand for machine learning (ML) model training on edge devices is
escalating due to data privacy and personalized service needs. However, we
observe that current on-device model training is hampered by the
under-utilization of on-device data, due to low training throughput, limited
storage and diverse data importance. To improve data resource utilization, we
propose a two-stage data selection framework {\sf Titan} to select the most
important data batch from streaming data for model training with guaranteed
efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, in the first stage, {\sf Titan}
filters out a candidate dataset with potentially high importance in a
coarse-grained manner.In the second stage of fine-grained selection, we propose
a theoretically optimal data selection strategy to identify the data batch with
the highest model performance improvement to current training round. To further
enhance time-and-resource efficiency, {\sf Titan} leverages a pipeline to
co-execute data selection and model training, and avoids resource conflicts by
exploiting idle computing resources. We evaluate {\sf Titan} on real-world edge
devices and three representative edge computing tasks with diverse models and
data modalities. Empirical results demonstrate that {\sf Titan} achieves up to
$43\%$ reduction in training time and $6.2\%$ increase in final accuracy with
minor system overhead, such as data processing delay, memory footprint and
energy consumption.

Result: FAB攻击在多种LLMs和三种目标行为（广告、拒绝、越狱）中均有效，且对用户微调选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAB攻击揭示了LLMs微调过程中的新安全威胁，强调了加强模型安全性的必要性。

Abstract: Finetuning openly accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) has become standard
practice for achieving task-specific performance improvements. Until now,
finetuning has been regarded as a controlled and secure process in which
training on benign datasets led to predictable behaviors. In this paper, we
demonstrate for the first time that an adversary can create poisoned LLMs that
initially appear benign but exhibit malicious behaviors once finetuned by
downstream users. To this end, our proposed attack, FAB (Finetuning-Activated
Backdoor), poisons an LLM via meta-learning techniques to simulate downstream
finetuning, explicitly optimizing for the emergence of malicious behaviors in
the finetuned models. At the same time, the poisoned LLM is regularized to
retain general capabilities and to exhibit no malicious behaviors prior to
finetuning. As a result, when users finetune the seemingly benign model on
their own datasets, they unknowingly trigger its hidden backdoor behavior. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of FAB across multiple LLMs and three target
behaviors: unsolicited advertising, refusal, and jailbreakability.
Additionally, we show that FAB-backdoors are robust to various finetuning
choices made by the user (e.g., dataset, number of steps, scheduler). Our
findings challenge prevailing assumptions about the security of finetuning,
revealing yet another critical attack vector exploiting the complexities of
LLMs.

Abstract: The growing complexity of power systems has made accurate load forecasting
more important than ever. An increasing number of advanced load forecasting
methods have been developed. However, the static design of current methods
offers no mechanism for human-model interaction. As the primary users of
forecasting models, system operators often find it difficult to understand and
apply these advanced models, which typically requires expertise in artificial
intelligence (AI). This also prevents them from incorporating their experience
and real-world contextual understanding into the forecasting process. Recent
breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) offer a new opportunity to
address this issue. By leveraging their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent collaboration
framework to bridge the gap between human operators and forecasting models. A
set of specialized agents is designed to perform different tasks in the
forecasting workflow and collaborate via a dedicated communication mechanism.
This framework embeds interactive mechanisms throughout the load forecasting
pipeline, reducing the technical threshold for non-expert users and enabling
the integration of human experience. Our experiments demonstrate that the
interactive load forecasting accuracy can be significantly improved when users
provide proper insight in key stages. Our cost analysis shows that the
framework remains affordable, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In the zero-shot policy transfer setting in reinforcement learning, the goal
is to train an agent on a fixed set of training environments so that it can
generalise to similar, but unseen, testing environments. Previous work has
shown that policy distillation after training can sometimes produce a policy
that outperforms the original in the testing environments. However, it is not
yet entirely clear why that is, or what data should be used to distil the
policy. In this paper, we prove, under certain assumptions, a generalisation
bound for policy distillation after training. The theory provides two practical
insights: for improved generalisation, you should 1) train an ensemble of
distilled policies, and 2) distil it on as much data from the training
environments as possible. We empirically verify that these insights hold in
more general settings, when the assumptions required for the theory no longer
hold. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble of policies distilled on a
diverse dataset can generalise significantly better than the original agent.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索如何利用合理化反事实解释（p-CFEs）来训练分类器，以提升其性能和减少数据中的虚假相关性。

Method: 方法是通过训练分类器使用p-CFEs标记的诱导错误目标类，同时对未扰动的输入用原始标签进行分类。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用p-CFEs进行训练是一种有效的方法，可以改进分类器的性能并减少数据偏见。

Abstract: Plausible counterfactual explanations (p-CFEs) are perturbations that
minimally modify inputs to change classifier decisions while remaining
plausible under the data distribution. In this study, we demonstrate that
classifiers can be trained on p-CFEs labeled with induced \emph{incorrect}
target classes to classify unperturbed inputs with the original labels. While
previous studies have shown that such learning is possible with adversarial
perturbations, we extend this paradigm to p-CFEs. Interestingly, our
experiments reveal that learning from p-CFEs is even more effective: the
resulting classifiers achieve not only high in-distribution accuracy but also
exhibit significantly reduced bias with respect to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Causal discovery for dynamical systems poses a major challenge in fields
where active interventions are infeasible. Most methods used to investigate
these systems and their associated benchmarks are tailored to deterministic,
low-dimensional and weakly nonlinear time-series data. To address these
limitations, we present CausalDynamics, a large-scale benchmark and extensible
data generation framework to advance the structural discovery of dynamical
causal models. Our benchmark consists of true causal graphs derived from
thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations as well as
two idealized climate models. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的潜变量校准方法和潜变量重新校准（LR）技术，用于提升多元响应变量的条件分布建模，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Motivation: 多元模型可能因误定或校准不佳导致预测不可靠，现有校准方法多限于单变量或无法提供完整密度函数，因此需解决这一局限。

Method: 提出潜变量校准概念，并设计LR方法学习潜空间变换，确保有限样本下的校准性，同时保持计算高效。

Result: 实验表明LR能显著降低潜变量校准误差和负对数似然。

Conclusion: LR在改进多元模型校准性能方面表现出色，提供了完整的密度函数。

Abstract: Reliably characterizing the full conditional distribution of a multivariate
response variable given a set of covariates is crucial for trustworthy
decision-making. However, misspecified or miscalibrated multivariate models may
yield a poor approximation of the joint distribution of the response variables,
leading to unreliable predictions and suboptimal decisions. Furthermore,
standard recalibration methods are primarily limited to univariate settings,
while conformal prediction techniques, despite generating multivariate
prediction regions with coverage guarantees, do not provide a full probability
density function. We address this gap by first introducing a novel notion of
latent calibration, which assesses probabilistic calibration in the latent
space of a conditional normalizing flow. Second, we propose latent
recalibration (LR), a novel post-hoc model recalibration method that learns a
transformation of the latent space with finite-sample bounds on latent
calibration. Unlike existing methods, LR produces a recalibrated distribution
with an explicit multivariate density function while remaining computationally
efficient. Extensive experiments on both tabular and image datasets show that
LR consistently improves latent calibration error and the negative
log-likelihood of the recalibrated models.

TL;DR: 文章摘要指出，尽管‘无意识公平’（FtU）在机器学习文献中被批评为不足以确保公平，但理论和实证研究表明，FtU可以在不降低准确性的情况下减少算法歧视。

Motivation: 探讨无意识公平（FtU）在实际应用中的潜力及其对减少算法歧视的作用。

Method: 结合理论研究与实证分析，并将FtU与模型多样性（Model Multiplicity）文献相联系。

Result: 研究表明FtU可以在不损失准确性的情况下减少歧视，并在实际应用中促成更公平的政策。

Conclusion: FtU在高风险场景中值得考虑，使用受保护属性需明确理由。

Abstract: Fairness through Unawareness (FtU) describes the idea that discrimination
against demographic groups can be avoided by not considering group membership
in the decisions or predictions. This idea has long been criticized in the
machine learning literature as not being sufficient to ensure fairness. In
addition, the use of additional features is typically thought to increase the
accuracy of the predictions for all groups, so that FtU is sometimes thought to
be detrimental to all groups. In this paper, we show both theoretically and
empirically that FtU can reduce algorithmic discrimination without necessarily
reducing accuracy. We connect this insight with the literature on Model
Multiplicity, to which we contribute with novel theoretical and empirical
results. Furthermore, we illustrate how, in a real-life application, FtU can
contribute to the deployment of more equitable policies without losing
efficacy. Our findings suggest that FtU is worth considering in practical
applications, particularly in high-risk scenarios, and that the use of
protected attributes such as gender in predictive models should be accompanied
by a clear and well-founded justification.

Conclusion: 维度压缩良率函数提升学习算法生物合理性，噪声可作为计算资源利用。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm provides a bottom-up alternative to
backpropagation (BP) for training neural networks, relying on a layer-wise
"goodness" function to guide learning. Existing goodness functions, inspired by
energy-based learning (EBL), are typically defined as the sum of squared
post-synaptic activations, neglecting the correlations between neurons. In this
work, we propose a novel goodness function termed dimensionality compression
that uses the effective dimensionality (ED) of fluctuating neural responses to
incorporate second-order statistical structure. Our objective minimizes ED for
clamped inputs when noise is considered while maximizing it across the sample
distribution, promoting structured representations without the need to prepare
negative samples. We demonstrate that this formulation achieves competitive
performance compared to other non-BP methods. Moreover, we show that noise
plays a constructive role that can enhance generalization and improve inference
when predictions are derived from the mean of squared outputs, which is
equivalent to making predictions based on the energy term. Our findings
contribute to the development of more biologically plausible learning
algorithms and suggest a natural fit for neuromorphic computing, where
stochasticity is a computational resource rather than a nuisance. The code is

Conclusion: 该方法在有限目标数据上表现稳健，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential for
enabling timely maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, impacting the operational
efficiency of electric applications that rely on them. This paper proposes a
RUL prediction approach that leverages data from recent charge-discharge cycles
to estimate the number of remaining usable cycles. The approach introduces both
a novel signal processing pipeline and a deep learning prediction model. In the
signal preprocessing pipeline, a derived capacity feature is computed based on
current and capacity signals. Alongside original capacity, voltage and current,
these features are denoised and enhanced using statistical metrics and a
delta-based method to capture differences between the current and previous
cycles. In the prediction model, the processed features are then fed into a
hybrid deep learning architecture composed of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN), Attentional Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM), and Ordinary Differential
Equation-based LSTM (ODE-LSTM) modules. This architecture is designed to
capture both local signal characteristics and long-range temporal dependencies
while modeling the continuous-time dynamics of battery degradation. The model
is further evaluated using transfer learning across different learning
strategies and target data partitioning scenarios. Results indicate that the
model maintains robust performance, even when fine-tuned on limited target
data. Experimental results on two publicly available large-scale datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a baseline deep learning
approach and machine learning techniques, achieving an RMSE of 101.59,
highlighting its strong potential for real-world RUL prediction applications.

Abstract: Blockchain transaction data exhibits high dimensionality, noise, and
intricate feature entanglement, presenting significant challenges for
traditional clustering algorithms. In this study, we conduct a comparative
analysis of three clustering approaches: (1) Classical K-Means Clustering,
applied to pre-processed feature representations; (2) Hybrid Clustering,
wherein classical features are enhanced with quantum random features extracted
using randomly initialized quantum neural networks (QNNs); and (3) Fully
Quantum Clustering, where a QNN is trained in a self-supervised manner
leveraging a SwAV-based loss function to optimize the feature space for
clustering directly. The proposed experimental framework systematically
investigates the impact of quantum circuit depth and the number of learned
prototypes, demonstrating that even shallow quantum circuits can effectively
extract meaningful non-linear representations, significantly improving
clustering performance.

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，该方法可以有效提升SSL模型在OOD任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 通过PID约束的批次采样策略能够显著改善SSL的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of
self-supervised learning (SSL). By analyzing the mini-batch construction during
the SSL training phase, we first give one plausible explanation for SSL having
OOD generalization. Then, from the perspective of data generation and causal
inference, we analyze and conclude that SSL learns spurious correlations during
the training process, which leads to a reduction in OOD generalization. To
address this issue, we propose a post-intervention distribution (PID) grounded
in the Structural Causal Model. PID offers a scenario where the spurious
variable and label variable is mutually independent. Besides, we demonstrate
that if each mini-batch during SSL training satisfies PID, the resulting SSL
model can achieve optimal worst-case OOD performance. This motivates us to
develop a batch sampling strategy that enforces PID constraints through the
learning of a latent variable model. Through theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate the identifiability of the latent variable model and validate the
effectiveness of the proposed sampling strategy. Experiments conducted on
various downstream OOD tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
sampling strategy.

Abstract: Sequencing a genome to determine an individual's DNA produces an enormous
number of short nucleotide subsequences known as reads, which must be
reassembled to reconstruct the full genome. We present a method for analyzing
this type of data using contrastive learning, in which an encoder model is
trained to produce embeddings that cluster together sequences from the same
genomic region. The sequential nature of genomic regions is preserved in the
form of trajectories through this embedding space. Trained solely to reflect
the structure of the genome, the resulting model provides a general
representation of $k$-mer sequences, suitable for a range of downstream tasks
involving read data. We apply our framework to learn the structure of the $E.\
coli$ genome, and demonstrate its use in simulated ancient DNA (aDNA) read
mapping and identification of structural variations. Furthermore, we illustrate
the potential of using this type of model for metagenomic species
identification. We show how incorporating a domain-specific noise model can
enhance embedding robustness, and how a supervised contrastive learning setting
can be adopted when a linear reference genome is available, by introducing a
distance thresholding parameter $\Gamma$. The model can also be trained fully
self-supervised on read data, enabling analysis without the need to construct a
full genome assembly using specialized algorithms. Small prediction heads based
on a pre-trained embedding are shown to perform on par with BWA-aln, the
current gold standard approach for aDNA mapping, in terms of accuracy and
runtime for short genomes. Given the method's favorable scaling properties with
respect to total genome size, inference using our approach is highly promising
for metagenomic applications and for mapping to genomes comparable in size to
the human genome.

TL;DR: 提出DACA方法，通过无监督方式优化后训练语言模型的置信度校准，解决了因数据稀缺和预测不一致导致的过自信问题。

Motivation: 后训练语言模型（PoLMs）常因过自信问题影响可靠性，且下游任务标记数据稀缺，需要一种有效校准方法。

Result: 实验表明DACA显著改善了校准性能，平均ECE提升达15.08%，适用于开源和API语言模型（如GPT-4o）。

Conclusion: DACA是一种有效改善PoLMs校准性能的无监督方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models is essential for adapting pre-trained
language models (PLMs) to align with human preferences and downstream tasks.
While PLMs typically exhibit well-calibrated confidence, post-trained language
models (PoLMs) often suffer from over-confidence, assigning high confidence to
both correct and incorrect outputs, which can undermine reliability in critical
applications. A major obstacle in calibrating PoLMs is the scarcity of labeled
data for individual downstream tasks. To address this, we propose
Disagreement-Aware Confidence Alignment (DACA), a novel unsupervised method to
optimize the parameters (e.g., temperature $\tau$) in post-hoc confidence
calibration. Our method is motivated by the under-confidence issue caused by
prediction disagreement between the PLM and PoLM while aligning their
confidence via temperature scaling. Theoretically, the PLM's confidence
underestimates PoLM's prediction accuracy on disagreement examples, causing a
larger $\tau$ and producing under-confident predictions. DACA mitigates this by
selectively using only agreement examples for calibration, effectively
decoupling the influence of disagreement. In this manner, our method avoids an
overly large $\tau$ in temperature scaling caused by disagreement examples,
improving calibration performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, improving the average ECE of open-sourced and
API-based LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o) by up to 15.08$\%$ on common benchmarks.

Method: 提出两阶段框架：训练时使用锐度感知最小化稳定学习；推理时通过预测熵排名并修正最不确定的概念。

Conclusion: 锐度感知训练和不确定性修正提升了CBMs在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，同时保持了可解释性。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) ensure interpretability by decomposing
predictions into human interpretable concepts. Yet the annotations used for
training CBMs that enable this transparency are often noisy, and the impact of
such corruption is not well understood. In this study, we present the first
systematic study of noise in CBMs and show that even moderate corruption
simultaneously impairs prediction performance, interpretability, and the
intervention effectiveness. Our analysis identifies a susceptible subset of
concepts whose accuracy declines far more than the average gap between noisy
and clean supervision and whose corruption accounts for most performance loss.
To mitigate this vulnerability we propose a two-stage framework. During
training, sharpness-aware minimization stabilizes the learning of
noise-sensitive concepts. During inference, where clean labels are unavailable,
we rank concepts by predictive entropy and correct only the most uncertain
ones, using uncertainty as a proxy for susceptibility. Theoretical analysis and
extensive ablations elucidate why sharpness-aware training confers robustness
and why uncertainty reliably identifies susceptible concepts, providing a
principled basis that preserves both interpretability and resilience in the
presence of noise.

TL;DR: 论文提出SeCO和SpaCO两种内存高效的训练范式，用于优化长上下文大型语言模型的训练成本和性能。

Motivation: 长上下文大型语言模型的训练成本过高，阻碍了定制化应用的发展。

Method: SeCO将长输入分块处理，每块独立计算和反向传播；SpaCO进一步选择性地传播梯度并引入补偿因子，减少计算开销。

Result: SeCO将最大序列长度扩展到16K tokens，SpaCO在相同实验条件下比SeCO快3倍。

Conclusion: SeCO和SpaCO为优化长上下文模型提供了新思路，使其更适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While long-context large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable document
processing capabilities, their prohibitively high training costs often hinder
customized applications. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textit{Sequential
Chunk-wise Optimization} (SeCO), a memory-efficient training paradigm that
partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently
constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation,
ensuring that only one chunk's forward activations are stored in memory.
Building on SeCO, we further introduce \textit{Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization}
(SpaCO), which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating
gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation
factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the
computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling
training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become
longer. Implemented as lightweight training wrappers, both SeCO and SpaCO offer
substantial practical benefits. For example, when fine-tuning an 8B model with
LoRA on a single RTX 3090 GPU, SeCO expands maximum sequence length from 1K to
16K tokens, while SpaCO demonstrates accelerated training speed -- achieving up
to 3x faster than SeCO under the same experimental setup. These innovations
provide new insights into optimizing long-context models, making them more
accessible for practical applications. We have open-sourced the code at

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale pre-trained Electroencephalogram (EEG) models

pre-trained models have struggled to fully capture the rich information content

performance and generalizability across diverse BCI tasks. This limitation is
frequently rooted in suboptimal architectural design choices which constrain
their representational capacity. In this work, we introduce LaBraM++, an
enhanced Large Brainwave Foundation Model (LBM) that incorporates principled
improvements grounded in robust signal processing foundations. LaBraM++
demonstrates substantial gains across a variety of tasks, consistently
outperforming its originally-based architecture and achieving competitive
results when compared to other open-source LBMs. Its superior performance and
training efficiency highlight its potential as a strong foundation for future
advancements in LBMs.

Abstract: Datasets in engineering domains are often small, sparsely labeled, and
contain numerical as well as categorical conditions. Additionally.
computational resources are typically limited in practical applications which
hinders the adoption of generative models for engineering tasks. We introduce a
novel masked-conditioning approach, that enables generative models to work with
sparse, mixed-type data. We mask conditions during training to simulate sparse
conditions at inference time. For this purpose, we explore the use of various
sparsity schedules that show different strengths and weaknesses. In addition,
we introduce a flexible embedding that deals with categorical as well as
numerical conditions. We integrate our method into an efficient variational
autoencoder as well as a latent diffusion model and demonstrate the
applicability of our approach on two engineering-related datasets of 2D point
clouds and images. Finally, we show that small models trained on limited data
can be coupled with large pretrained foundation models to improve generation
quality while retaining the controllability induced by our conditioning scheme.

Conclusion: 新框架通过捕获信息收集价值，无需外部探索奖励或手工启发式方法，有效解决了探索与利用的平衡问题。

Abstract: Optimal decision-making under partial observability requires agents to
balance reducing uncertainty (exploration) against pursuing immediate
objectives (exploitation). In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
optimization framework for continuous partially observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) that explicitly addresses this challenge. Our method casts
policy learning as probabilistic inference in a non-Markovian Feynman--Kac
model that inherently captures the value of information gathering by
anticipating future observations, without requiring extrinsic exploration
bonuses or handcrafted heuristics. To optimize policies under this model, we
develop a nested sequential Monte Carlo~(SMC) algorithm that efficiently
estimates a history-dependent policy gradient under samples from the optimal
trajectory distribution induced by the POMDP. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our algorithm across standard continuous POMDP benchmarks, where existing
methods struggle to act under uncertainty.

Conclusion: FoD通过简化的前向扩散框架实现了高效的生成建模，具有竞争力且易于实现。

Abstract: This work presents a forward-only diffusion (FoD) approach for generative
modelling. In contrast to traditional diffusion models that rely on a coupled
forward-backward diffusion scheme, FoD directly learns data generation through
a single forward diffusion process, yielding a simple yet efficient generative
framework. The core of FoD is a state-dependent linear stochastic differential
equation that involves a mean-reverting term in both the drift and diffusion
functions. This mean-reversion property guarantees the convergence to clean
data, naturally simulating a stochastic interpolation between source and target
distributions. More importantly, FoD is analytically tractable and is trained
using a simple stochastic flow matching objective, enabling a few-step
non-Markov chain sampling during inference. The proposed FoD model, despite its
simplicity, achieves competitive performance on various image-conditioned
(e.g., image restoration) and unconditional generation tasks, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generative modelling. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进简单行为，显著提升了策略的稳健性和任务性能。

Abstract: Simplicity is a powerful inductive bias. In reinforcement learning,
regularization is used for simpler policies, data augmentation for simpler
representations, and sparse reward functions for simpler objectives, all that,
with the underlying motivation to increase generalizability and robustness by
focusing on the essentials. Supplementary to these techniques, we investigate
how to promote simple behavior throughout the episode. To that end, we
introduce a modification of the reinforcement learning problem that
additionally maximizes the total correlation within the induced trajectories.
We propose a practical algorithm that optimizes all models, including policy
and state representation, based on a lower-bound approximation. In simulated
robot environments, our method naturally generates policies that induce
periodic and compressible trajectories, and that exhibit superior robustness to
noise and changes in dynamics compared to baseline methods, while also
improving performance in the original tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了图神经网络（GNN）中的过度平滑现象，特别是反向传播中的过度平滑问题，揭示了其与非线性激活函数的相互作用以及在优化过程中引入的虚假静止点的存在。

Motivation: 为了深入理解GNN中过度平滑的优化问题，探讨反向传播误差如何导致梯度消失和虚假静止点的现象。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了GNN中正向与反向平滑的相互作用，揭示了反向误差的线性平滑特性及其对梯度的影响。

Result: 证明了GNN中反向传播误差会导致虚假静止点的出现，即梯度接近于零时损失仍然较高，这种现象在深层GNN中尤为明显。

Conclusion: 研究表明反向传播中的过度平滑是GNN优化的一个关键问题，为深入理解其优化特性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has long been identified as a major limitation of Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs): input node features are smoothed at each layer and converge to
a non-informative representation, if the weights of the GNN are sufficiently
bounded. This assumption is crucial: if, on the contrary, the weights are
sufficiently large, then oversmoothing may not happen. Theoretically, GNN could
thus learn to not oversmooth. However it does not really happen in practice,
which prompts us to examine oversmoothing from an optimization point of view.
In this paper, we analyze backward oversmoothing, that is, the notion that
backpropagated errors used to compute gradients are also subject to
oversmoothing from output to input. With non-linear activation functions, we
outline the key role of the interaction between forward and backward smoothing.
Moreover, we show that, due to backward oversmoothing, GNNs provably exhibit
many spurious stationary points: as soon as the last layer is trained, the
whole GNN is at a stationary point. As a result, we can exhibit regions where
gradients are near-zero while the loss stays high. The proof relies on the fact
that, unlike forward oversmoothing, backward errors are subjected to a linear
oversmoothing even in the presence of non-linear activation function, such that
the average of the output error plays a key role. Additionally, we show that
this phenomenon is specific to deep GNNs, and exhibit counter-example
Multi-Layer Perceptron. This paper is a step toward a more complete
comprehension of the optimization landscape specific to GNNs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种安全性感知的优化框架SAP，用于在微调大型语言模型时缓解安全性退化问题。

Motivation: 尽管预训练阶段已实施安全性对齐技术，但研究发现微调过程中即使使用无害数据仍可能导致安全性退化。

Method: 引入安全性感知探针（SAP），在梯度传播过程中识别潜在风险方向，从而优化模型性能同时保持安全性。

Result: SAP有效降低了微调模型的危害性，同时保持与标准微调方法相当的测试损失。

Conclusion: SAP框架能够在提升任务性能的同时，显著减少安全隐患。

Abstract: The significant progress of large language models (LLMs) has led to
remarkable achievements across numerous applications. However, their ability to
generate harmful content has sparked substantial safety concerns. Despite the
implementation of safety alignment techniques during the pre-training phase,
recent research indicates that fine-tuning LLMs on adversarial or even benign
data can inadvertently compromise their safety. In this paper, we re-examine
the fundamental issue of why fine-tuning on non-harmful data still results in
safety degradation. We introduce a safety-aware probing (SAP) optimization
framework designed to mitigate the safety risks of fine-tuning LLMs.
Specifically, SAP incorporates a safety-aware probe into the gradient
propagation process, mitigating the model's risk of safety degradation by
identifying potential pitfalls in gradient directions, thereby enhancing
task-specific performance while successfully preserving model safety. Our
extensive experimental results demonstrate that SAP effectively reduces
harmfulness below the original fine-tuned model and achieves comparable test
loss to standard fine-tuning methods. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 结论是最小注意力控制原则在高维非线性动力学中具有显著优势，尤其是在快速适应和能量效率方面。

Abstract: Minimum attention applies the least action principle in the changes of
control concerning state and time, first proposed by Brockett. The involved
regularization is highly relevant in emulating biological control, such as
motor learning. We apply minimum attention in reinforcement learning (RL) as
part of the rewards and investigate its connection to meta-learning and
stabilization. Specifically, model-based meta-learning with minimum attention
is explored in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics. Ensemble-based model
learning and gradient-based meta-policy learning are alternately performed.
Empirically, we show that the minimum attention does show outperforming
competence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in model-free and
model-based RL, i.e., fast adaptation in few shots and variance reduction from
the perturbations of the model and environment. Furthermore, the minimum
attention demonstrates the improvement in energy efficiency.

optimization aspect of this problem. We will assume the demand data to be
given, since Air France estimates it beforehand using real data. Similarly, we
assume all price options to be predetermined by Air France's algorithms and
verified by their analysts. Our objective will be to maximize the revenue of a
direct flight by choosing the prices for each product from the predefined set
of options.

Result: PyTupli提供了一种高效、安全的解决方案，支持离线强化学习数据集的管理与共享。

Conclusion: PyTupli通过改进数据集基础设施，促进了离线强化学习研究的协作性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction as a powerful
paradigm for learning control policies from pre-collected data, eliminating the
need for costly or risky online interactions. While many open-source libraries
offer robust implementations of offline RL algorithms, they all rely on
datasets composed of experience tuples consisting of state, action, next state,
and reward. Managing, curating, and distributing such datasets requires
suitable infrastructure. Although static datasets exist for established
benchmark problems, no standardized or scalable solution supports developing
and sharing datasets for novel or user-defined benchmarks. To address this gap,
we introduce PyTupli, a Python-based tool to streamline the creation, storage,
and dissemination of benchmark environments and their corresponding tuple
datasets. PyTupli includes a lightweight client library with defined interfaces
for uploading and retrieving benchmarks and data. It supports fine-grained
filtering at both the episode and tuple level, allowing researchers to curate
high-quality, task-specific datasets. A containerized server component enables
production-ready deployment with authentication, access control, and automated
certificate provisioning for secure use. By addressing key barriers in dataset
infrastructure, PyTupli facilitates more collaborative, reproducible, and
scalable offline RL research.

Conclusion: 提出的MOGP方法不仅扩展了现有高斯过程在图结构数据中的应用，还提供了更高的灵活性和通用性。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is a type of data to be obtained associated with a
graph structure where vertices and edges describe some kind of data
correlation. This paper proposes a regression method on graph-structured data,
which is based on multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGP), to capture both the
correlation between vertices and the correlation between associated data. The
proposed formulation is built on the definition of MOGP. This allows it to be
applied to a wide range of data configurations and scenarios. Moreover, it has
high expressive capability due to its flexibility in kernel design. It includes
existing methods of Gaussian processes for graph-structured data as special
cases and is possible to remove restrictions on data configurations, model
selection, and inference scenarios in the existing methods. The performance of
extensions achievable by the proposed formulation is evaluated through computer
experiments with synthetic and real data.

Abstract: We introduce FlowMixer, a neural architecture that leverages constrained

FlowMixer incorporates non-negative matrix mixing layers within a reversible
mapping framework-applying transforms before mixing and their inverses
afterward. This shape-preserving design enables a Kronecker-Koopman eigenmode
framework that bridges statistical learning with dynamical systems theory,
providing interpretable spatiotemporal patterns and facilitating direct
algebraic manipulation of prediction horizons without retraining. Extensive
experiments across diverse domains demonstrate FlowMixer's robust long-horizon
forecasting capabilities while effectively modeling physical phenomena such as
chaotic attractors and turbulent flows. These results suggest that
architectural constraints can simultaneously enhance predictive performance and
mathematical interpretability in neural forecasting systems.

Method: 提出MELD方法，通过参数化噪声调度网络为分子图中的原子和键分配不同的噪声率，避免状态冲突。

Result: MELD将化学有效性从15%提升至93%，并在条件生成任务中达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MELD通过避免状态冲突显著提升了分子生成的质量和化学有效性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have achieved notable progress in modeling
discrete data, while their potential in molecular generation remains
underexplored. In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the
surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the
performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing
problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a
common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be
learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To
mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that
orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between
distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise
scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph
elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular
benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality
compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity
of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves
state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.

Motivation: 现实中的机器学习应用常涉及多模态数据，但获取所有模态数据成本高昂。因此，需要优先选择哪些样本获取额外模态数据。

Method: 结合生成式插补和判别式建模，估计缺失模态数据的预期收益，并提出性能上限启发式方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比单模态信息、熵引导或随机选择更有效地指导模态获取。

Conclusion: CAMA在资源受限情况下优化模态获取，提升资源利用率。

Abstract: Real-world machine learning applications often involve data from multiple
modalities that must be integrated effectively to make robust predictions.
However, in many practical settings, not all modalities are available for every
sample, and acquiring additional modalities can be costly. This raises the
question: which samples should be prioritized for additional modality
acquisition when resources are limited? While prior work has explored
individual-level acquisition strategies and training-time active learning
paradigms, test-time and cohort-based acquisition remain underexplored despite
their importance in many real-world settings. We introduce Cohort-based Active
Modality Acquisition (CAMA), a novel test-time setting to formalize the
challenge of selecting which samples should receive additional modalities. We
derive acquisition strategies that leverage a combination of generative
imputation and discriminative modeling to estimate the expected benefit of
acquiring missing modalities based on common evaluation metrics. We also
introduce upper-bound heuristics that provide performance ceilings to benchmark
acquisition strategies. Experiments on common multimodal datasets demonstrate
that our proposed imputation-based strategies can more effectively guide the
acquisition of new samples in comparison to those relying solely on unimodal
information, entropy guidance, and random selections. Our work provides an
effective solution for optimizing modality acquisition at the cohort level,
enabling better utilization of resources in constrained settings.

Method: 采用DRL游戏测试代理，比较三种不同PCG技术的NPC生成版本（随机生成和遗传算法生成）。

Result: 遗传算法版本（版本2和3）的DRL代理在胜率和训练时间上显著优于随机版本（版本1），胜率峰值达97%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效评估PCG在SGs中的集成效果，为未来研究提供数据支持。

Abstract: Serious Games (SGs) are nowadays shifting focus to include procedural content
generation (PCG) in the development process as a means of offering personalized
and enhanced player experience. However, the development of a framework to
assess the impact of PCG techniques when integrated into SGs remains
particularly challenging. This study proposes a methodology for automated
evaluation of PCG integration in SGs, incorporating deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) game testing agents. To validate the proposed framework, a previously
introduced SG featuring card game mechanics and incorporating three different
versions of PCG for nonplayer character (NPC) creation has been deployed.
Version 1 features random NPC creation, while versions 2 and 3 utilize a
genetic algorithm approach. These versions are used to test the impact of
different dynamic SG environments on the proposed framework's agents. The
obtained results highlight the superiority of the DRL game testing agents
trained on Versions 2 and 3 over those trained on Version 1 in terms of win
rate (i.e. number of wins per played games) and training time. More
specifically, within the execution of a test emulating regular gameplay, both
Versions 2 and 3 peaked at a 97% win rate and achieved statistically
significant higher (p=0009) win rates compared to those achieved in Version 1
that peaked at 94%. Overall, results advocate towards the proposed framework's
capability to produce meaningful data for the evaluation of procedurally
generated content in SGs.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习上下文价值分布，并适用于多种随机优化问题。

Abstract: Motivated by stochastic optimization, we introduce the problem of learning
from samples of contextual value distributions. A contextual value distribution
can be understood as a family of real-valued distributions, where each sample
consists of a context $x$ and a random variable drawn from the corresponding
real-valued distribution $D_x$. By minimizing a convex surrogate loss, we learn
an empirical distribution $D'_x$ for each context, ensuring a small L\'evy
distance to $D_x$. We apply this result to obtain the sample complexity bounds
for the learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for stochastic optimization
problems defined on an unknown contextual value distribution. The sample
complexity is shown to be polynomial for the general case of strongly monotone
and stable optimization problems, including Single-item Revenue Maximization,
Pandora's Box and Optimal Stopping.

Abstract: Long-term planning, as in reinforcement learning (RL), involves finding
strategies: actions that collectively work toward a goal rather than
individually optimizing their immediate outcomes. As part of a strategy, some
actions are taken at the expense of short-term benefit to enable future actions
with even greater returns. These actions are only advantageous if followed up
by the actions they facilitate, consequently, they would not have been taken if
those follow-ups were not available. In this paper, we quantify such
dependencies between planned actions with strategic link scores: the drop in
the likelihood of one decision under the constraint that a follow-up decision
is no longer available. We demonstrate the utility of strategic link scores
through three practical applications: (i) explaining black-box RL agents by
identifying strategically linked pairs among decisions they make, (ii)
improving the worst-case performance of decision support systems by
distinguishing whether recommended actions can be adopted as standalone
improvements or whether they are strategically linked hence requiring a
commitment to a broader strategy to be effective, and (iii) characterizing the
planning processes of non-RL agents purely through interventions aimed at
measuring strategic link scores - as an example, we consider a realistic
traffic simulator and analyze through road closures the effective planning
horizon of the emergent routing behavior of many drivers.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data privacy across decentralized participants.
As FL adoption grows, numerous techniques have been proposed to tackle its
practical challenges. However, the lack of standardized evaluation across key
dimensions hampers systematic progress and fair comparison of FL methods. In
this work, we introduce ATR-Bench, a unified framework for analyzing federated
learning through three foundational dimensions: Adaptation, Trust, and
Reasoning. We provide an in-depth examination of the conceptual foundations,
task formulations, and open research challenges associated with each theme. We
have extensively benchmarked representative methods and datasets for adaptation
to heterogeneous clients and trustworthiness in adversarial or unreliable
environments. Due to the lack of reliable metrics and models for reasoning in
FL, we only provide literature-driven insights for this dimension. ATR-Bench
lays the groundwork for a systematic and holistic evaluation of federated
learning with real-world relevance. We will make our complete codebase publicly
accessible and a curated repository that continuously tracks new developments
and research in the FL literature.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PORL的方法，通过仅依赖离线预训练策略，而不需要预训练的Q函数，实现了高效的在线强化学习微调。

Motivation: 预训练策略在在线强化学习中性能提升的关键挑战在于现有方法需要依赖离线预训练的Q函数，这限制了其适用性并可能因保守主义而阻碍探索。

Method: 提出PORL方法，在在线阶段从零快速初始化Q函数，避免有害的悲观主义。

Result: PORL不仅在性能上与现有方法相当，还为直接微调行为克隆策略开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: PORL方法解决了依赖Q函数的问题，为在线强化学习微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Improving the performance of pre-trained policies through online
reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical yet challenging topic. Existing
online RL fine-tuning methods require continued training with offline
pretrained Q-functions for stability and performance. However, these offline
pretrained Q-functions commonly underestimate state-action pairs beyond the
offline dataset due to the conservatism in most offline RL methods, which
hinders further exploration when transitioning from the offline to the online
setting. Additionally, this requirement limits their applicability in scenarios
where only pre-trained policies are available but pre-trained Q-functions are
absent, such as in imitation learning (IL) pre-training. To address these
challenges, we propose a method for efficient online RL fine-tuning using
solely the offline pre-trained policy, eliminating reliance on pre-trained
Q-functions. We introduce PORL (Policy-Only Reinforcement Learning
Fine-Tuning), which rapidly initializes the Q-function from scratch during the
online phase to avoid detrimental pessimism. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance with advanced offline-to-online RL algorithms and
online RL approaches that leverage data or policies prior, but also pioneers a
new path for directly fine-tuning behavior cloning (BC) policies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦学习框架下的系统识别（SYSID）算法IC-SYSID，通过动态聚类和合并方法解决了多数据源问题，并在实际车辆动力学学习中验证了其有效性。

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中系统识别（SYSID）问题，尤其是在缺乏先验知识的情况下处理多数据源的挑战。

Method: 提出IC-SYSID算法，结合增量聚类ClusterCraft和ClusterMerge方法，通过正则化损失函数和mini-batch深度学习优化模型稳定性。

Result: IC-SYSID在车辆动力学学习中表现出高性能，避免了不稳定聚类问题。

Conclusion: IC-SYSID是一种有效的联邦学习框架下的SYSID解决方案，适用于多数据源且无需先验知识的场景。

Abstract: This paper addresses the System Identification (SYSID) problem within the
framework of federated learning. We introduce a novel algorithm, Incremental
Clustering-based federated learning method for SYSID (IC-SYSID), designed to
tackle SYSID challenges across multiple data sources without prior knowledge.
IC-SYSID utilizes an incremental clustering method, ClusterCraft (CC), to
eliminate the dependency on the prior knowledge of the dataset. CC starts with
a single cluster model and assigns similar local workers to the same clusters
by dynamically increasing the number of clusters. To reduce the number of
clusters generated by CC, we introduce ClusterMerge, where similar cluster
models are merged. We also introduce enhanced ClusterCraft to reduce the
generation of similar cluster models during the training. Moreover, IC-SYSID
addresses cluster model instability by integrating a regularization term into
the loss function and initializing cluster models with scaled Glorot
initialization. It also utilizes a mini-batch deep learning approach to manage
large SYSID datasets during local training. Through the experiments conducted
on a real-world representing SYSID problem, where a fleet of vehicles
collaboratively learns vehicle dynamics, we show that IC-SYSID achieves a high
SYSID performance while preventing the learning of unstable clusters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GCAL的图持续自适应学习方法，用于解决多图域适应问题，其通过双层优化策略显著提升了模型的适应性和知识保留能力。

Motivation: 传统图域适应方法局限于单步适应，难以处理连续域偏移并容易导致灾难性遗忘，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: GCAL采用双层优化策略，包括基于信息最大化的“适应”阶段和基于信息瓶颈理论的“生成记忆”阶段，后者通过变分记忆图生成模块压缩原始图为记忆。

Result: 实验结果表明，GCAL在适应性和知识保留方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GCAL为图域适应问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够持续适应多样化的图域并减少遗忘。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of graph domain adaptation on evolving,
multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) graphs. Conventional graph domain adaptation
methods are confined to single-step adaptation, making them ineffective in
handling continuous domain shifts and prone to catastrophic forgetting. This
paper introduces the Graph Continual Adaptive Learning (GCAL) method, designed
to enhance model sustainability and adaptability across various graph domains.
GCAL employs a bilevel optimization strategy. The "adapt" phase uses an
information maximization approach to fine-tune the model with new graph domains
while re-adapting past memories to mitigate forgetting. Concurrently, the
"generate memory" phase, guided by a theoretical lower bound derived from
information bottleneck theory, involves a variational memory graph generation
module to condense original graphs into memories. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that GCAL substantially outperforms existing methods in
terms of adaptability and knowledge retention.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced
critical security challenges, underscoring the need for accurate anomaly
detection. Although numerous studies have proposed machine learning (ML)
methods for this purpose, limited research systematically examines how
different preprocessing steps--normalization, transformation, and feature
selection--interact with distinct model architectures. To address this gap,
this paper presents a multi-step evaluation framework assessing the combined
impact of preprocessing choices on three ML algorithms: RNN-LSTM, autoencoder
neural networks (ANN), and Gradient Boosting (GBoosting). Experiments on the
IoTID20 dataset shows that GBoosting consistently delivers superior accuracy
across preprocessing configurations, while RNN-LSTM shows notable gains with
z-score normalization and autoencoders excel in recall, making them well-suited
for unsupervised scenarios. By offering a structured analysis of preprocessing
decisions and their interplay with various ML techniques, the proposed
framework provides actionable guidance to enhance anomaly detection performance
in IoT environments.

Conclusion: 双任务框架有效整合了蛋白质间和蛋白质内结构知识，提升了模型的生物应用能力。

Abstract: Protein language models (pLMs) pre-trained on vast protein sequence databases
excel at various downstream tasks but lack the structural knowledge essential
for many biological applications. To address this, we integrate structural
insights from pre-trained protein graph neural networks (pGNNs) into pLMs
through a latent-level contrastive learning task. This task aligns residue
representations from pLMs with those from pGNNs across multiple proteins,
enriching pLMs with inter-protein structural knowledge. Additionally, we
incorporate a physical-level task that infuses intra-protein structural
knowledge by optimizing pLMs to predict structural tokens. The proposed
dual-task framework effectively incorporates both inter-protein and
intra-protein structural knowledge into pLMs. Given the variability in the
quality of protein structures in PDB, we further introduce a residue loss
selection module, which uses a small model trained on high-quality structures
to select reliable yet challenging residue losses for the pLM to learn.
Applying our structure alignment method to the state-of-the-art ESM2 and
AMPLIFY results in notable performance gains across a wide range of tasks,
including a 12.7% increase in ESM2 contact prediction. The data, code, and
resulting SaESM2 and SaAMPLIFY models will be released on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: 无监督提示方法在GNN中展现了强大的潜力，尤其在资源有限的情况下。

Abstract: Prompt tuning methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular to
address the semantic gap between pre-training and fine-tuning steps. However,
existing GNN prompting methods rely on labeled data and involve lightweight
fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, in-context learning methods for
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance with no parameter
updating and no or minimal labeled data. Inspired by these approaches, in this
work, we first introduce a challenging problem setup to evaluate GNN prompting
methods. This setup encourages a prompting function to enhance a pre-trained
GNN's generalization to a target dataset under covariate shift without updating
the GNN's parameters and with no labeled data. Next, we propose a fully
unsupervised prompting method based on consistency regularization through
pseudo-labeling. We use two regularization techniques to align the prompted
graphs' distribution with the original data and reduce biased predictions.
Through extensive experiments under our problem setting, we demonstrate that
our unsupervised approach outperforms the state-of-the-art prompting methods
that have access to labels.

Abstract: This paper presents a concise review of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB)
methods and introduces an experimental framework for scalable, interpretable
offer selection, addressing the challenge of fast-changing offers. The approach
models context at the product category level, allowing offers to span multiple
categories and enabling knowledge transfer across similar offers. This improves
learning efficiency and generalization in dynamic environments. The framework
extends standard CMAB methodology to support multi-category contexts, and
achieves scalability through efficient feature engineering and modular design.
Advanced features such as MPG (Member Purchase Gap) and MF (Matrix
Factorization) capture nuanced user-offer interactions, with implementation in
Python for practical deployment.
  A key contribution is interpretability at scale: logistic regression models
yield transparent weight vectors, accessible via a large language model (LLM)
interface for real-time, user-level tracking and explanation of evolving
preferences. This enables the generation of detailed member profiles and
identification of behavioral patterns, supporting personalized offer
optimization and enhancing trust in automated decisions. By situating our
prototype alongside established paradigms like Generalized Linear Models and
Thompson Sampling, we demonstrate its value for both research and real-world
CMAB applications.

Result: 实验表明，新损失函数在多个金融场景中优于现有方法，部分场景有已知解析解。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了数值不稳定性问题，并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: Risk-averse reinforcement learning finds application in various high-stakes
fields. Unlike classical reinforcement learning, which aims to maximize
expected returns, risk-averse agents choose policies that minimize risk,
occasionally sacrificing expected value. These preferences can be framed
through utility theory. We focus on the specific case of the exponential
utility function, where we can derive the Bellman equations and employ various
reinforcement learning algorithms with few modifications. However, these
methods suffer from numerical instability due to the need for exponent
computation throughout the process. To address this, we introduce a numerically
stable and mathematically sound loss function based on the Itakura-Saito
divergence for learning state-value and action-value functions. We evaluate our
proposed loss function against established alternatives, both theoretically and
empirically. In the experimental section, we explore multiple financial
scenarios, some with known analytical solutions, and show that our loss
function outperforms the alternatives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Polar Express是一种新型GPU友好算法，用于计算极分解，解决了深度学习中对高效GPU兼容方法的需求，同时避免了传统数值分析方法的不足。

Motivation: 在深度学习中，传统的极分解和矩阵符号函数算法（如Newton-Schulz或基于有理函数的方法）效率低且不适合GPU，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: Polar Express通过动态调整多项式更新规则，并在每次迭代中求解极小极大优化问题，实现了快速收敛和GPU兼容性。

Result: 实验表明，Polar Express在GPT-2等大型模型中显著提高了验证损失的表现，且在不同学习率下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Polar Express是一种适用于深度学习的高效、稳定的极分解算法。

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has
been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently,
it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within
the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting
differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep
learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high
accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like
Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based
on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are
poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a
GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical
polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix
multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen &
Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule
at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that
it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both
rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address
finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply
Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent
improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2,
outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Result: LLaDA-V在多模态任务中表现出色，性能接近或超过LLaMA3-V和Qwen2-VL，且在数据可扩展性上更优。

Conclusion: 语言扩散模型在多模态任务中具有潜力，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce LLaDA-V, a purely diffusion-based Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) that integrates visual instruction tuning with masked
diffusion models, representing a departure from the autoregressive paradigms
dominant in current multimodal approaches. Built upon LLaDA, a representative
large language diffusion model, LLaDA-V incorporates a vision encoder and MLP
connector that projects visual features into the language embedding space,
enabling effective multimodal alignment. Our empirical investigation reveals
several intriguing results: First, LLaDA-V demonstrates promising multimodal
performance despite its language model being weaker on purely textual tasks
than counterparts like LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B. When trained on the same
instruction data, LLaDA-V is highly competitive to LLaMA3-V across multimodal
tasks with better data scalability. It also narrows the performance gap to
Qwen2-VL, suggesting the effectiveness of its architecture for multimodal
tasks. Second, LLaDA-V achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal
understanding compared to existing hybrid autoregressive-diffusion and purely
diffusion-based MLLMs. Our findings suggest that large language diffusion
models show promise in multimodal contexts and warrant further investigation in
future research. Project page and codes:

Abstract: This work develops the underpinnings of self-supervised placement-aware
representation learning given spatially-distributed (multi-view and multimodal)
sensor observations, motivated by the need to represent external environmental
state in multi-sensor IoT systems in a manner that correctly distills spatial
phenomena from the distributed multi-vantage observations. The objective of
sensing in IoT systems is, in general, to collectively represent an externally
observed environment given multiple vantage points from which sensory
observations occur. Pretraining of models that help interpret sensor data must
therefore encode the relation between signals observed by sensors and the
observers' vantage points in order to attain a representation that encodes the
observed spatial phenomena in a manner informed by the specific placement of
the measuring instruments, while allowing arbitrary placement. The work
significantly advances self-supervised model pretraining from IoT signals
beyond current solutions that often overlook the distinctive spatial nature of
IoT data. Our framework explicitly learns the dependencies between measurements
and geometric observer layouts and structural characteristics, guided by a core
design principle: the duality between signals and observer positions. We
further provide theoretical analyses from the perspectives of information
theory and occlusion-invariant representation learning to offer insight into
the rationale behind our design. Experiments on three real-world
datasets--covering vehicle monitoring, human activity recognition, and
earthquake localization--demonstrate the superior generalizability and
robustness of our method across diverse modalities, sensor placements,
application-level inference tasks, and spatial scales.

Abstract: Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their
capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks.
This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical
applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in
settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare.
However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical
utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and
sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional
supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically
meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and
chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate
state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients
from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic
medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We
measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface
tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data
representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation
of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future
healthcare foundation models.

TL;DR: MixAT结合离散和连续对抗攻击训练，显著提升LLMs的鲁棒性，ALO-ASR低至20%，同时计算成本低。

Motivation: 当前对抗攻击仍能诱导LLMs生成有害内容，而现有对抗训练方法因计算成本高依赖连续松弛，导致模型易受离散攻击。

Method: 提出MixAT，结合更强离散攻击和快速连续攻击进行训练，并引入ALO-ASR指标评估最差情况下的模型脆弱性。

Result: MixAT的ALO-ASR<20%，优于现有防御方法（ALO-ASR>50%），且计算成本与连续松弛方法相当。

Conclusion: MixAT为LLMs提供了一种高效且鲁棒的防御方法，显著提升了安全性与准确性。

Abstract: Despite recent efforts in Large Language Models (LLMs) safety and alignment,
current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs are still able to force harmful
generations consistently. Although adversarial training has been widely studied
and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine
learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less
understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are
effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial
prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous
relaxations. As these relaxations do not correspond to discrete input tokens,
such latent training methods often leave models vulnerable to a diverse set of
discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT,
a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks
during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of
state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate
(ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show
MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to
prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to
methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic
deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank
adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation,
revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results
demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and
superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead,
highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and
models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.

Result: 改进后的模型在数学推理任务中表现优异，性能超过传统Transformer及启发式缓存压缩方法。

Conclusion: 通过信息理论优化Transformer内存处理，可以解决仅靠规模扩展无法克服的基础推理限制。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models struggle with
generalisation beyond their training distribution, often exhibiting
sophisticated pattern interpolation rather than true abstract reasoning
(extrapolation). In this work, we approach this limitation through the lens of
Information Bottleneck (IB) theory, which posits that model generalisation
emerges from an optimal balance between input compression and retention of
predictive information in latent representations. We prove using IB theory that
decoder-only Transformers are inherently constrained in their ability to form
task-optimal sequence representations. We then use this result to demonstrate
that periodic global transformation of the internal sequence-level
representations (KV cache) is a necessary computational step for improving
Transformer generalisation in reasoning tasks. Based on these theoretical
insights, we propose a modification to the Transformer architecture, in the
form of an additional module that globally rewrites the KV cache at periodic
intervals, shifting its capacity away from memorising input prefixes and toward
encoding features most useful for predicting future tokens. Our model delivers
substantial gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming both
vanilla Transformers with up to 3.5x more parameters, as well as
heuristic-driven pruning mechanisms for cache compression. Our approach can be
seen as a principled generalisation of existing KV-cache compression methods;
whereas such methods focus solely on compressing input representations, they
often do so at the expense of retaining predictive information, and thus their
capabilities are inherently bounded by those of an unconstrained model. This
establishes a principled framework to manipulate Transformer memory using
information theory, addressing fundamental reasoning limitations that scaling
alone cannot overcome.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential in supporting

However, much of the progress to date has been evaluated on small-scale,

existing CO benchmarks lack sufficient training data, limiting their utility
for evaluating data-driven approaches. To address these limitations, we
introduce FrontierCO, a comprehensive benchmark that covers eight canonical CO
problem types and evaluates 16 representative ML-based solvers--including graph

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架ICYM2I，用于评估多模态学习中缺失模态下的预测性能和信息增益，通过逆概率加权校正解决忽略缺失带来的偏差。

Motivation: 多模态学习在AI应用中具有潜力，但开发与部署时的模态可能因成本、硬件故障或感知信息量不同而缺失，导致信息增益估算不准确。

Method: 提出ICYM2I框架，通过逆概率加权校正方法，评估缺失模态下的预测性能和信息增益。

Conclusion: ICYM2I能有效纠正多模态学习中因缺失模态导致的偏差，提升信息增益估算的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal learning is of continued interest in artificial intelligence-based
applications, motivated by the potential information gain from combining
different types of data. However, modalities collected and curated during
development may differ from the modalities available at deployment due to
multiple factors including cost, hardware failure, or -- as we argue in this
work -- the perceived informativeness of a given modality. Na{\"i}ve estimation
of the information gain associated with including an additional modality
without accounting for missingness may result in improper estimates of that
modality's value in downstream tasks. Our work formalizes the problem of
missingness in multimodal learning and demonstrates the biases resulting from
ignoring this process. To address this issue, we introduce ICYM2I (In Case You
Multimodal Missed It), a framework for the evaluation of predictive performance
and information gain under missingness through inverse probability
weighting-based correction. We demonstrate the importance of the proposed
adjustment to estimate information gain under missingness on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world medical datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have become a cornerstone of modern generative
AI, yet the mechanisms underlying their generalization remain poorly
understood. In fact, if these models were perfectly minimizing their training
loss, they would just generate data belonging to their training set, i.e.,
memorize, as empirically found in the overparameterized regime. We revisit this
view by showing that, in highly overparameterized diffusion models,
generalization in natural data domains is progressively achieved during
training before the onset of memorization. Our results, ranging from image to
language diffusion models, systematically support the empirical law that
memorization time is proportional to the dataset size. Generalization vs.
memorization is then best understood as a competition between time scales. We
show that this phenomenology is recovered in diffusion models learning a simple
probabilistic context-free grammar with random rules, where generalization
corresponds to the hierarchical acquisition of deeper grammar rules as training
time grows, and the generalization cost of early stopping can be characterized.
We summarize these results in a phase diagram. Overall, our results support
that a principled early-stopping criterion - scaling with dataset size - can
effectively optimize generalization while avoiding memorization, with direct
implications for hyperparameter transfer and privacy-sensitive applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为统一微调(UFT)的新方法，将监督微调(SFT)和强化微调(RFT)结合，以克服两者的局限性，并在不同规模的模型上均表现出优越性能。

Motivation: 现有后训练方法如SFT和RFT各有优缺点：SFT适合小模型但容易过拟合，RFT泛化性好但对基础模型依赖强。论文旨在结合两者优势，提出更高效的方法。

Method: 提出统一微调(UFT)，将SFT和RFT整合为一个过程，既结合监督信号，又能探索解决方案。

Result: UFT在不同规模模型上均优于SFT和RFT，并理论证明其能突破RFT的指数样本复杂度瓶颈。

Conclusion: UFT是一种高效的后训练方法，能够显著提升模型推理能力并加速收敛。

Abstract: Post-training has demonstrated its importance in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary post-training methods
can be categorized into supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT is efficient and well-suited for small language models,
but it may lead to overfitting and limit the reasoning abilities of larger
models. In contrast, RFT generally yields better generalization but depends
heavily on the strength of the base model. To address the limitations of SFT
and RFT, we propose Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT), a novel post-training paradigm
that unifies SFT and RFT into a single, integrated process. UFT enables the
model to effectively explore solutions while incorporating informative
supervision signals, bridging the gap between memorizing and thinking
underlying existing methods. Notably, UFT outperforms both SFT and RFT in
general, regardless of model sizes. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that
UFT breaks RFT's inherent exponential sample complexity bottleneck, showing for
the first time that unified training can exponentially accelerate convergence
on long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite decades of advancements, the simulation of fluids remains one of the
most challenging areas of in scientific computing. Supported by the necessity
of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have
emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics
simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a
differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with
Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both
the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established
benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show
that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated
turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised
training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular,
we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow
purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with
our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while
keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights
into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a
physically informed regularization technique. To ensure that the full potential
of PICT can be leveraged, it is published as open source:

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) and Universal Physics-Informed Neural Networks (UPINNs), are effective
at isolating either parameters or functions but can face challenges when

introduce a framework that addresses these limitations by establishing
conditions under which unique solutions can be guaranteed. To illustrate, we
apply it to examples from biological systems and ecological dynamics,
demonstrating accurate and interpretable results. Our approach significantly
enhances the potential of machine learning techniques in modeling complex
systems in science and engineering.

Abstract: We propose a general framework for conditional sampling in PDE-based inverse
problems, targeting the recovery of whole solutions from extremely sparse or
noisy measurements. This is accomplished by a function-space diffusion model
and plug-and-play guidance for conditioning. Our method first trains an
unconditional discretization-agnostic denoising model using neural operator
architectures. At inference, we refine the samples to satisfy sparse
observation data via a gradient-based guidance mechanism. Through rigorous
mathematical analysis, we extend Tweedie's formula to infinite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, providing the theoretical foundation for our posterior sampling
approach. Our method (FunDPS) accurately captures posterior distributions in
function spaces under minimal supervision and severe data scarcity. Across five
PDE tasks with only 3% observation, our method achieves an average 32% accuracy
improvement over state-of-the-art fixed-resolution diffusion baselines while
reducing sampling steps by 4x. Furthermore, multi-resolution fine-tuning
ensures strong cross-resolution generalizability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first diffusion-based framework to operate independently of
discretization, offering a practical and flexible solution for forward and
inverse problems in the context of PDEs. Code is available at

Abstract: Prompting is one of the main ways to adapt a pretrained model to target
tasks. Besides manually constructing prompts, many prompt optimization methods
have been proposed in the literature. Method development is mainly empirically
driven, with less emphasis on a conceptual understanding of prompting. In this
paper we discuss how optimal prompting can be understood through a Bayesian
view, which also implies some fundamental limitations of prompting that can
only be overcome by tuning weights. The paper explains in detail how
meta-trained neural networks behave as Bayesian predictors over the pretraining
distribution, whose hallmark feature is rapid in-context adaptation. Optimal
prompting can be studied formally as conditioning these Bayesian predictors,
yielding criteria for target tasks where optimal prompting is and is not
possible. We support the theory with educational experiments on LSTMs and
Transformers, where we compare different versions of prefix-tuning and
different weight-tuning methods. We also confirm that soft prefixes, which are
sequences of real-valued vectors outside the token alphabet, can lead to very
effective prompts for trained and even untrained networks by manipulating
activations in ways that are not achievable by hard tokens. This adds an
important mechanistic aspect beyond the conceptual Bayesian theory.

Method: 提出了两种概念擦除机制模型：降低目标概念生成概率和干扰模型内部引导机制，并设计了一套包括对抗攻击、新型探测技术和替代生成分析的评估框架。

Result: 揭示了最小化副作用与保持对抗提示鲁棒性之间的紧张关系。

Conclusion: 强调了综合评估在扩散模型中的重要性。

Abstract: Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating
specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches
emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly
these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual
models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the
likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the
model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept
has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent
evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel
probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in
place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between
minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts.
Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for
erasure in diffusion models.

TL;DR: RIPT-VLA 是一种简单、可扩展的强化学习交互式后训练范式，通过稀疏的二元成功奖励对预训练的视觉-语言-动作模型进行微调。

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型训练依赖于离线专家示范数据，限制了其在低数据环境下适应新任务的能力。

Method: 使用动态滚动采样和留一法优势估计的稳定策略优化算法进行交互式后训练。

Result: RIPT-VLA 显著提升了轻量级 QueST 模型和 7B OpenVLA-OFT 模型的性能，并在仅需一次示范的情况下将失败率从 96% 降低到 3%。

Conclusion: RIPT-VLA 是一种实用有效的后训练范式，能够在最小监督下提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce RIPT-VLA, a simple and scalable reinforcement-learning-based
interactive post-training paradigm that fine-tunes pretrained
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using only sparse binary success rewards.
Existing VLA training pipelines rely heavily on offline expert demonstration
data and supervised imitation, limiting their ability to adapt to new tasks and
environments under low-data regimes. RIPT-VLA addresses this by enabling
interactive post-training with a stable policy optimization algorithm based on
dynamic rollout sampling and leave-one-out advantage estimation.
  RIPT-VLA has the following characteristics. First, it applies to various VLA
models, resulting in an improvement on the lightweight QueST model by 21.2%,
and the 7B OpenVLA-OFT model to an unprecedented 97.5% success rate. Second, it
is computationally efficient and data-efficient: with only one demonstration,
RIPT-VLA enables an unworkable SFT model (4%) to succeed with a 97% success
rate within 15 iterations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the policy learned
by RIPT-VLA generalizes across different tasks and scenarios and is robust to
the initial state context. These results highlight RIPT-VLA as a practical and
effective paradigm for post-training VLA models through minimal supervision.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过动态选择候选边来改进TSP算法性能的方法，采用多臂老虎机模型优化LKH及其扩展LKH-3算法。

Motivation: 现有的TSP算法（如LKH）在局部搜索中使用静态候选边，容易陷入局部最优，限制了找到更好解的能力。

Method: 通过多臂老虎机模型动态选择候选边，扩展候选集以提供更多选择机会。

Result: 在多TSP基准测试中表现优异，并能显著提升LKH-3在各类变体问题上的性能。

Conclusion: 动态选择候选边的方法可以提升算法性能，适用于TSP及其变体问题。

Abstract: Algorithms designed for routing problems typically rely on high-quality
candidate edges to guide their search, aiming to reduce the search space and
enhance the search efficiency. However, many existing algorithms, like the
classical Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP), often use predetermined candidate edges that remain static
throughout local searches. This rigidity could cause the algorithm to get
trapped in local optima, limiting its potential to find better solutions. To
address this issue, we propose expanding the candidate sets to include other
promising edges, providing them an opportunity for selection. Specifically, we
incorporate multi-armed bandit models to dynamically select the most suitable
candidate edges in each iteration, enabling LKH to make smarter choices and
lead to improved solutions. Extensive experiments on multiple TSP benchmarks
show the excellent performance of our method. Moreover, we employ this
bandit-based method to LKH-3, an extension of LKH tailored for solving various
TSP variant problems, and our method also significantly enhances LKH-3's
performance across typical TSP variants.

Method: PhyX包含3K多模态问题，覆盖6种推理类型和6个物理领域，采用多种评估范式和分析方法。

Result: 当前最先进模型（如GPT-4o、Claude3.7-Sonnet等）在PhyX上表现不佳，准确率显著低于人类专家。

Conclusion: PhyX揭示了模型在物理推理上的局限性，包括依赖记忆知识、数学公式和浅层视觉匹配，而非真正的物理理解。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks fail to capture a crucial aspect of intelligence:
physical reasoning, the integrated ability to combine domain knowledge,
symbolic reasoning, and understanding of real-world constraints. To address
this gap, we introduce PhyX: the first large-scale benchmark designed to assess
models capacity for physics-grounded reasoning in visual scenarios. PhyX
includes 3K meticulously curated multimodal questions spanning 6 reasoning
types across 25 sub-domains and 6 core physics domains: thermodynamics,
electromagnetism, mechanics, modern physics, optics, and wave\&acoustics. In
our comprehensive evaluation, even state-of-the-art models struggle
significantly with physical reasoning. GPT-4o, Claude3.7-Sonnet, and
GPT-o4-mini achieve only 32.5\%, 42.2\%, and 45.8\% accuracy
respectively-performance gaps exceeding 29\% compared to human experts. Our
analysis exposes critical limitations in current models: over-reliance on
memorized disciplinary knowledge, excessive dependence on mathematical
formulations, and surface-level visual pattern matching rather than genuine
physical understanding. We provide in-depth analysis through fine-grained
statistics, detailed case studies, and multiple evaluation paradigms to
thoroughly examine physical reasoning capabilities. To ensure reproducibility,
we implement a compatible evaluation protocol based on widely-used toolkits
such as VLMEvalKit, enabling one-click evaluation.

Abstract: We present a method for the automated discovery of system-level dynamics in
Flow-Lenia$-$a continuous cellular automaton (CA) with mass conservation and
parameter localization$-$using a curiosity-driven AI scientist. This method
aims to uncover processes leading to self-organization of evolutionary and
ecosystemic dynamics in CAs. We build on previous work which uses diversity
search algorithms in Lenia to find self-organized individual patterns, and
extend it to large environments that support distinct interacting patterns. We
adapt Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) to drive
exploration of diverse Flow-Lenia environments using simulation-wide metrics,
such as evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale
entropy. We test our method in two experiments, showcasing its ability to
illuminate significantly more diverse dynamics compared to random search. We
show qualitative results illustrating how ecosystemic simulations enable
self-organization of complex collective behaviors not captured by previous
individual pattern search and analysis. We complement automated discovery with
an interactive exploration tool, creating an effective human-AI collaborative
workflow for scientific investigation. Though demonstrated specifically with
Flow-Lenia, this methodology provides a framework potentially applicable to
other parameterizable complex systems where understanding emergent collective
properties is of interest.

Motivation: 随着AI推理能力的进步，尤其是大型推理模型（LRMs）的出现，了解儿童如何概念化AI的推理过程对培养AI素养至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先与8名儿童进行共同设计会议，随后对106名儿童（3-8年级）进行实地研究，识别了三种AI推理模型。

Result: 研究发现，低年级儿童（3-5年级）倾向于认为AI的推理基于固有智能，而高年级儿童（6-8年级）则将AI视为模式识别器。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了儿童对AI推理理解的三种张力，并提出了对AI课程设计和可解释性AI工具开发的建议。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances in reasoning capabilities, most
recently with the emergence of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), understanding how
children conceptualize AI's reasoning processes becomes critical for fostering
AI literacy. While one of the "Five Big Ideas" in AI education highlights
reasoning algorithms as central to AI decision-making, less is known about
children's mental models in this area. Through a two-phase approach, consisting
of a co-design session with 8 children followed by a field study with 106
children (grades 3-8), we identified three models of AI reasoning: Deductive,
Inductive, and Inherent. Our findings reveal that younger children (grades 3-5)
often attribute AI's reasoning to inherent intelligence, while older children
(grades 6-8) recognize AI as a pattern recognizer. We highlight three tensions
that surfaced in children's understanding of AI reasoning and conclude with
implications for scaffolding AI curricula and designing explainable AI tools.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于因果关系的端到端框架，通过学习观测数据中的路由策略来优化LLM路由的性能。

Motivation: 现有方法通常采用解耦策略，容易产生误差累积，且依赖昂贵的数据反馈。本文旨在通过观测数据和端到端学习解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种因果端到端框架，引入了两个理论支持的代理目标：分类上界和能收敛到最优策略的softmax加权遗憾近似。还扩展了框架以处理异构成本偏好。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过观测数据和端到端学习，该方法有效提升了LLM路由的性能和效率。

Abstract: LLM routing aims to select the most appropriate model for each query,
balancing competing performance metrics such as accuracy and cost across a pool
of language models. Prior approaches typically adopt a decoupled strategy,
where the metrics are first predicted and the model is then selected based on
these estimates. This setup is prone to compounding errors and often relies on
full-feedback data, where each query is evaluated by all candidate models,
which is costly to obtain and maintain in practice. In contrast, we learn from
observational data, which records only the outcome of the model actually
deployed. We propose a causal end-to-end framework that learns routing policies
by minimizing decision-making regret from observational data. To enable
efficient optimization, we introduce two theoretically grounded surrogate
objectives: a classification-based upper bound, and a softmax-weighted regret
approximation shown to recover the optimal policy at convergence. We further
extend our framework to handle heterogeneous cost preferences via an
interval-conditioned architecture. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
our method outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across different embedding models.

Conclusion: 该数据集为LLM的物理和空间推理能力提供了独特的评估基准，补充了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset designed to benchmark the physical and spatial
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) based on topology
optimization, a method for computing optimal material distributions within a
design space under prescribed loads and supports. In this dataset, LLMs are
provided with conditions such as 2D boundary, applied forces and supports, and
must reason about the resulting optimal material distribution. The dataset
includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within
partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these
tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material
distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or
explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural
stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of
spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a
complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究探讨了内存管理对大型语言模型（LLM）代理长期行为的影响，重点关注内存的添加和删除操作。研究发现代理具有经验跟随性，但会带来错误传播和对齐问题，提出选择性添加和删除策略以提升性能。

Motivation: LLM代理的内存管理对其任务性能有重要影响，但目前缺乏对其长期行为和挑战的系统性研究。

Method: 通过定量分析代理的记忆操作（添加和删除），研究其对行为的影响，并进行控制实验验证策略。

Result: 选择性添加和删除策略能显著提升代理性能（平均10%），并缓解错误传播和对齐问题。

Conclusion: 内存管理策略对代理的长期性能至关重要，研究为设计高效内存系统提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Memory is a critical component in large language model (LLM)-based agents,
enabling them to store and retrieve past executions to improve task performance
over time. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on how memory
management choices impact the LLM agents' behavior, especially their long-term
performance. Specifically, we focus on two fundamental memory operations that
are widely used by many agent frameworks-addition, which incorporates new
experiences into the memory base, and deletion, which selectively removes past
experiences-to systematically study their impact on the agent behavior. Through
our quantitative analysis, we find that LLM agents display an
experience-following property: high similarity between a task input and the
input in a retrieved memory record often results in highly similar agent
outputs. Our analysis further reveals two significant challenges associated
with this property: error propagation, where inaccuracies in past experiences
compound and degrade future performance, and misaligned experience replay,
where outdated or irrelevant experiences negatively influence current tasks.
Through controlled experiments, we show that combining selective addition and
deletion strategies can help mitigate these negative effects, yielding an
average absolute performance gain of 10% compared to naive memory growth.
Furthermore, we highlight how memory management choices affect agents' behavior
under challenging conditions such as task distribution shifts and constrained
memory resources. Our findings offer insights into the behavioral dynamics of
LLM agent memory systems and provide practical guidance for designing memory
components that support robust, long-term agent performance. We also release
our code to facilitate further study.

Conclusion: SynEVO为NeuroAI提供了知识迁移和适应的新范式。

Abstract: Discovering regularities from spatiotemporal systems can benefit various
scientific and social planning. Current spatiotemporal learners usually train
an independent model from a specific source data that leads to limited
transferability among sources, where even correlated tasks requires new design
and training. The key towards increasing cross-domain knowledge is to enable
collective intelligence and model evolution. In this paper, inspired by
neuroscience theories, we theoretically derive the increased information
boundary via learning cross-domain collective intelligence and propose a
Synaptic EVOlutional spatiotemporal network, SynEVO, where SynEVO breaks the
model independence and enables cross-domain knowledge to be shared and
aggregated. Specifically, we first re-order the sample groups to imitate the
human curriculum learning, and devise two complementary learners, elastic
common container and task-independent extractor to allow model growth and
task-wise commonality and personality disentanglement. Then an adaptive dynamic
coupler with a new difference metric determines whether the new sample group
should be incorporated into common container to achieve model evolution under
various domains. Experiments show that SynEVO improves the generalization
capacity by at most 42% under cross-domain scenarios and SynEVO provides a
paradigm of NeuroAI for knowledge transfer and adaptation.

Abstract: We have seen remarkable progress in large language models (LLMs) empowered
multi-agent systems solving complex tasks necessitating cooperation among
experts with diverse skills. However, optimizing LLM-based multi-agent systems
remains challenging. In this work, we perform an empirical case study on group
optimization of role-based multi-agent systems utilizing natural language
feedback for challenging software development tasks under various evaluation

identifying underperforming agents with their failure explanations utilizing
textual feedback and then optimizing system prompts of identified agents
utilizing failure explanations. We then study the impact of various
optimization settings on system performance with two comparison groups: online
against offline optimization and individual against group optimization. For
group optimization, we study two prompting strategies: one-pass and multi-pass
prompting optimizations. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
optimization method for role-based multi-agent systems tackling software
development tasks evaluated on diverse evaluation dimensions, and we
investigate the impact of diverse optimization settings on group behaviors of
the multi-agent systems to provide practical insights for future development.

Abstract: As of 2025, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has become a central
tool for productivity across industries. Beyond text generation, GenAI now
plays a critical role in coding, data analysis, and research workflows. As
large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, it is essential to assess the
reliability and accuracy of their outputs, especially in specialized,
high-stakes domains like finance. Most modern LLMs transform text into
numerical vectors, which are used in operations such as cosine similarity
searches to generate responses. However, this abstraction process can lead to
misinterpretation of emotional tone, particularly in nuanced financial
contexts. While LLMs generally excel at identifying sentiment in everyday
language, these models often struggle with the nuanced, strategically ambiguous
language found in earnings call transcripts. Financial disclosures frequently
embed sentiment in hedged statements, forward-looking language, and
industry-specific jargon, making it difficult even for human analysts to
interpret consistently, let alone AI models. This paper presents findings from
the Santa Clara Microsoft Practicum Project, led by Professor Charlie
Goldenberg, which benchmarks the performance of Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's
ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and traditional machine learning models for sentiment
analysis of financial text. Using Microsoft earnings call transcripts, the
analysis assesses how well LLM-derived sentiment correlates with market
sentiment and stock movements and evaluates the accuracy of model outputs.
Prompt engineering techniques are also examined to improve sentiment analysis
results. Visualizations of sentiment consistency are developed to evaluate
alignment between tone and stock performance, with sentiment trends analyzed
across Microsoft's lines of business to determine which segments exert the
greatest influence.

Conclusion: TrialPanorama数据库和基准任务的发布将推动AI在临床试验中的进一步研究。

Abstract: Developing artificial intelligence (AI) for vertical domains requires a solid
data foundation for both training and evaluation. In this work, we introduce
TrialPanorama, a large-scale, structured database comprising 1,657,476 clinical
trial records aggregated from 15 global sources. The database captures key
aspects of trial design and execution, including trial setups, interventions,
conditions, biomarkers, and outcomes, and links them to standard biomedical
ontologies such as DrugBank and MedDRA. This structured and ontology-grounded
design enables TrialPanorama to serve as a unified, extensible resource for a
wide range of clinical trial tasks, including trial planning, design, and
summarization. To demonstrate its utility, we derive a suite of benchmark tasks
directly from the TrialPanorama database. The benchmark spans eight tasks
across two categories: three for systematic review (study search, study
screening, and evidence summarization) and five for trial design (arm design,
eligibility criteria, endpoint selection, sample size estimation, and trial
completion assessment). The experiments using five state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) show that while general-purpose LLMs exhibit some
zero-shot capability, their performance is still inadequate for high-stakes
clinical trial workflows. We release TrialPanorama database and the benchmark
to facilitate further research on AI for clinical trials.

Abstract: Validating scientific hypotheses is a central challenge in biomedical
research, and remains difficult for artificial intelligence (AI) agents due to
the complexity of real-world data analysis and evidence interpretation. In this
work, we present BioDSA-1K, a benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on
realistic, data-driven biomedical hypothesis validation tasks. BioDSA-1K
consists of 1,029 hypothesis-centric tasks paired with 1,177 analysis plans,
curated from over 300 published biomedical studies to reflect the structure and
reasoning found in authentic research workflows. Each task includes a
structured hypothesis derived from the original study's conclusions, expressed
in the affirmative to reflect the language of scientific reporting, and one or
more pieces of supporting evidence grounded in empirical data tables. While
these hypotheses mirror published claims, they remain testable using standard
statistical or machine learning methods. The benchmark enables evaluation along
four axes: (1) hypothesis decision accuracy, (2) alignment between evidence and
conclusion, (3) correctness of the reasoning process, and (4) executability of
the AI-generated analysis code. Importantly, BioDSA-1K includes non-verifiable
hypotheses: cases where the available data are insufficient to support or
refute a claim, reflecting a common yet underexplored scenario in real-world
science. We propose BioDSA-1K as a foundation for building and evaluating
generalizable, trustworthy AI agents for biomedical discovery.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has reshaped agent systems.
Unlike traditional rule-based agents with limited task scope, LLM-powered
agents offer greater flexibility, cross-domain reasoning, and natural language
interaction. Moreover, with the integration of multi-modal LLMs, current agent
systems are highly capable of processing diverse data modalities, including
text, images, audio, and structured tabular data, enabling richer and more

categorize agent systems into software-based, physical, and adaptive hybrid
systems, highlighting applications across customer service, software
development, manufacturing automation, personalized education, financial

LLM-powered agents, including high inference latency, output uncertainty, lack

Motivation: 现有推理基准通常忽视真实创造力，侧重于模式记忆。Sudoku-Bench通过独特数独变体填补这一空白。

Method: 采用精选的数独变体作为测试集，提供标准化文本表示和工具支持，便于扩展研究。

Result: 实验中，顶尖大语言模型在无辅助情况下解决率低于15%，显示长视野推理能力不足。

Conclusion: Sudoku-Bench为评估和提升创造性推理提供了有效工具，凸显推理能力改进空间。

Abstract: Existing reasoning benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) frequently
fail to capture authentic creativity, often rewarding memorization of
previously observed patterns. We address this shortcoming with Sudoku-Bench, a
curated benchmark of challenging and unconventional Sudoku variants
specifically selected to evaluate creative, multi-step logical reasoning.
Sudoku variants form an unusually effective domain for reasoning research: each
puzzle introduces unique or subtly interacting constraints, making memorization
infeasible and requiring solvers to identify novel logical breakthroughs
(``break-ins''). Despite their diversity, Sudoku variants maintain a common and
compact structure, enabling clear and consistent evaluation. Sudoku-Bench
includes a carefully chosen puzzle set, a standardized text-based puzzle
representation, and flexible tools compatible with thousands of publicly
available puzzles -- making it easy to extend into a general research
environment. Baseline experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs solve fewer
than 15\% of puzzles unaided, highlighting significant opportunities to advance
long-horizon, strategic reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Unlearning Shapley的高效数据估值框架，通过机器学习遗忘技术避免了传统方法的高计算成本和数据依赖性。

Motivation: 随着大模型的普及，传统的数据估值方法（如基于博弈论的Shapley值）计算成本过高或需要完整数据，亟需一种更高效且实用的解决方案。

Method: 利用机器学习遗忘技术，从预训练模型中移除目标数据并测量性能变化，通过蒙特卡洛采样计算Shapley值，无需重新训练或依赖完整数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在基准数据集和大规模文本语料库上与传统方法精度相当，计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: Unlearning Shapley填补了数据估值理论与实际应用之间的鸿沟，为现代AI生态系统提供了可扩展且隐私合规的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of large models has intensified the need for efficient data
valuation methods to quantify the contribution of individual data providers.
Traditional approaches, such as game-theory-based Shapley value and
influence-function-based techniques, face prohibitive computational costs or
require access to full data and model training details, making them hardly
achieve partial data valuation. To address this, we propose Unlearning Shapley,
a novel framework that leverages machine unlearning to estimate data values
efficiently. By unlearning target data from a pretrained model and measuring
performance shifts on a reachable test set, our method computes Shapley values
via Monte Carlo sampling, avoiding retraining and eliminating dependence on
full data. Crucially, Unlearning Shapley supports both full and partial data
valuation, making it scalable for large models (e.g., LLMs) and practical for
data markets. Experiments on benchmark datasets and large-scale text corpora
demonstrate that our approach matches the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods
while reducing computational overhead by orders of magnitude. Further analysis
confirms a strong correlation between estimated values and the true impact of
data subsets, validating its reliability in real-world scenarios. This work
bridges the gap between data valuation theory and practical deployment,
offering a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for modern AI ecosystems.

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖于静态预定义指标，难以适应动态训练过程，尤其是在线强化学习框架。

Method: SAI-DPO通过实时反馈模型性能，动态选择训练数据，以适应模型能力的演变。

Result: 在三个先进模型和八个数学推理基准测试中，SAI-DPO平均提升了21.3个百分点，特别是在AIME24和AMC23上分别提升了10和15个百分点。

Conclusion: 动态、模型自适应的数据选择策略在提升推理能力上优于静态方法。

Abstract: In the realm of data selection for reasoning tasks, existing approaches
predominantly rely on externally predefined static metrics such as difficulty
and diversity, which are often designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
lack adaptability to continuous training processes. A critical limitation of
these methods is their inability to dynamically align with the evolving
capabilities of models during online training, a gap that becomes increasingly
pronounced with the rise of dynamic training paradigms and online reinforcement
learning (RL) frameworks (e.g., R1 models). To address this, we introduce
SAI-DPO, an algorithm that dynamically selects training data by continuously
assessing a model's stage-specific reasoning abilities across different
training phases. By integrating real-time model performance feedback, SAI-DPO
adaptively adapts data selection to the evolving strengths and weaknesses of
the model, thus enhancing both data utilization efficiency and final task
performance. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art models and eight
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including challenging competition-level
datasets (e.g., AIME24 and AMC23), demonstrate that SAI-DPO achieves an average
performance boost of up to 21.3 percentage points, with particularly notable
improvements of 10 and 15 points on AIME24 and AMC23, respectively. These
results highlight the superiority of dynamic, model-adaptive data selection
over static, externally defined strategies in advancing reasoning.

Motivation: 尽管现有的监督微调（SFT）方法提升了LRMs的安全性能，但它们对未见越狱提示的泛化能力不足。研究发现，LRMs的生成过程中存在一个‘安全顿悟时刻’，可以触发安全推理并生成安全响应。

Method: 提出了SafeKey方法，包括两个互补目标：1）双路径安全头，增强关键句前的模型内部表示中的安全信号；2）查询掩码建模目标，改进模型对查询理解的注意力。

Result: 实验表明，SafeKey在多个安全基准测试中显著提升了安全泛化能力，平均有害率降低了9.6%，同时保持了模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: SafeKey通过重塑内部注意力和改进隐藏表示质量，有效增强了LRMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) introduce a new generation paradigm of
explicitly reasoning before answering, leading to remarkable improvements in
complex tasks. However, they pose great safety risks against harmful queries
and adversarial attacks. While recent mainstream safety efforts on LRMs,
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improve safety performance, we find that
SFT-aligned models struggle to generalize to unseen jailbreak prompts. After
thorough investigation of LRMs' generation, we identify a safety aha moment
that can activate safety reasoning and lead to a safe response. This aha moment
typically appears in the `key sentence', which follows models' query
understanding process and can indicate whether the model will proceed safely.
Based on these insights, we propose SafeKey, including two complementary
objectives to better activate the safety aha moment in the key sentence: (1) a
Dual-Path Safety Head to enhance the safety signal in the model's internal
representations before the key sentence, and (2) a Query-Mask Modeling
objective to improve the models' attention on its query understanding, which
has important safety hints. Experiments across multiple safety benchmarks
demonstrate that our methods significantly improve safety generalization to a
wide range of jailbreak attacks and out-of-distribution harmful prompts,
lowering the average harmfulness rate by 9.6\%, while maintaining general
abilities. Our analysis reveals how SafeKey enhances safety by reshaping
internal attention and improving the quality of hidden representations.

Motivation: 多智能体系统中的动态分析受限于事件位置数据的离散性，无法直接计算速度等关键指标，限制了团队行为理解的深度。

Method: 利用神经网络基于事件位置数据补全所有运动员的速度信息，并考虑了时间依赖性和交互图结构。

Result: 神经网络方法在速度补全误差上优于基于规则的方法，且补全速度的空间评估结果更接近完整追踪数据。

Conclusion: 该方法可显著提升团队运动的动态分析能力，为战略理解提供更全面的数据支持。

Abstract: In many real-world complex systems, the behavior can be observed as a
collection of discrete events generated by multiple interacting agents.
Analyzing the dynamics of these multi-agent systems, especially team sports,
often relies on understanding the movement and interactions of individual
agents. However, while providing valuable snapshots, event-based positional
data typically lacks the continuous temporal information needed to directly
calculate crucial properties such as velocity. This absence severely limits the
depth of dynamic analysis, preventing a comprehensive understanding of
individual agent behaviors and emergent team strategies. To address this
challenge, we propose a new method to simultaneously complete the velocity of
all agents using only the event-based positional data from team sports. Based
on this completed velocity information, we investigate the applicability of
existing team sports analysis and evaluation methods. Experiments using soccer
event data demonstrate that neural network-based approaches outperformed
rule-based methods regarding velocity completion error, considering the
underlying temporal dependencies and graph structure of player-to-player or
player-to-ball interaction. Moreover, the space evaluation results obtained
using the completed velocity are closer to those derived from complete tracking
data, highlighting our method's potential for enhanced team sports system
analysis.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为LightRouter的新框架，旨在从大量LLMs中选择并集成一小部分模型，以同时优化任务性能和成本效率。

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在性能、成本和计算需求上的差异为用户选择合适的模型带来了挑战。

Method: LightRouter采用自适应选择机制和集成策略，减少启动标记数量并优化输出组合。

Result: 实验表明，LightRouter在多个基准测试中表现优于现有的集成方法，准确率提升达25%，同时降低了27%的推理成本。

Conclusion: LightRouter为高效LLM选择和模型组合提供了实用方法，无需预知模型知识。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has unlocked remarkable
capabilities across a diverse array of natural language processing tasks.
However, the considerable differences among available LLMs-in terms of cost,
performance, and computational demands-pose significant challenges for users
aiming to identify the most suitable model for specific tasks. In this work, we
present LightRouter, a novel framework designed to systematically select and
integrate a small subset of LLMs from a larger pool, with the objective of
jointly optimizing both task performance and cost efficiency. LightRouter
leverages an adaptive selection mechanism to identify models that require only
a minimal number of boot tokens, thereby reducing costs, and further employs an
effective integration strategy to combine their outputs. Extensive experiments
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LightRouter matches or outperforms
widely-used ensemble baselines, achieving up to a 25% improvement in accuracy.
Compared with leading high-performing models, LightRouter achieves comparable
performance while reducing inference costs by up to 27%. Importantly, our
framework operates without any prior knowledge of individual models and relies
exclusively on inexpensive, lightweight models. This work introduces a
practical approach for efficient LLM selection and provides valuable insights
into optimal strategies for model combination.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MADCluster是一个模型无关的异常检测框架，利用自监督聚类解决现有深度学习异常检测中的'超球坍塌'问题。

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法中的'超球坍塌'问题，并提升异常检测的泛化能力。

Method: 通过自监督聚类将正常模式数据映射到单一簇中心，并提出'One-directed Adaptive loss'优化目标，包含Base Embedder、Cluster Distance Mapping和Sequence-wise Clustering三个组件。

Result: 在四个时间序列基准数据集上显著提升了对比模型的性能。

Conclusion: MADCluster具有跨架构兼容性，有望提升多种模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly
detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is
applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the
'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly
detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a
'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping
data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective
single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The
optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of
three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal
dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous
center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying
various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series
benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall
performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of
MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various
architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE框架利用伪标注样本解决多示例上下文学习（ICL）中的标签数据不足问题，通过自适应选择伪标注样本提升LLM性能。

Motivation: 解决多示例ICL中大量标注数据高成本的问题，提出利用伪标注样本补充标签信息不足。

Method: 提出MAPLE框架，通过影响力分析选择未标注样本进行伪标注，并自适应地为每个测试查询选择样本。

Result: 实验证明MAPLE能有效提升LLM的适应性和性能，尤其是在标注数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: MAPLE是一种高效的多示例ICL框架，可降低标注成本并提升模型性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
diverse tasks by incorporating multiple input-output examples, known as
demonstrations, into the input of LLMs. More recently, advancements in the
expanded context windows of LLMs have led to many-shot ICL, which uses hundreds
of demonstrations and outperforms few-shot ICL, which relies on fewer examples.
However, this approach is often hindered by the high cost of obtaining large
amounts of labeled data. To address this challenge, we propose Many-Shot
Adaptive Pseudo-LabEling, namely MAPLE, a novel influence-based many-shot ICL
framework that utilizes pseudo-labeled samples to compensate for the lack of
label information. We first identify a subset of impactful unlabeled samples
and perform pseudo-labeling on them by querying LLMs. These pseudo-labeled
samples are then adaptively selected and tailored to each test query as input
to improve the performance of many-shot ICL, without significant labeling
costs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its ability to enhance LLM
adaptability and performance with limited labeled data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在知识图谱工程（KGE）中的性能与模型大小的关系，发现虽然大模型通常表现更好，但某些情况下小模型更具成本效益。

Motivation: 探索在KGE任务中，LLM的模型大小与性能之间的关系，并结合资源成本寻找最优模型。

Method: 使用LLM-KG-Bench框架评估26个开源先进LLM在KGE任务中的表现，分析模型大小与性能的关系。

Result: 研究发现模型大小与性能基本遵循缩放规律，但存在平台或天花板效应，某些情况下小模型更具性价比。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中结合成本效益评估模型大小，并测试同一家族中相邻大小的模型。

Abstract: When using Large Language Models (LLMs) to support Knowledge Graph
Engineering (KGE), one of the first indications when searching for an
appropriate model is its size. According to the scaling laws, larger models
typically show higher capabilities. However, in practice, resource costs are
also an important factor and thus it makes sense to consider the ratio between
model performance and costs. The LLM-KG-Bench framework enables the comparison
of LLMs in the context of KGE tasks and assesses their capabilities of
understanding and producing KGs and KG queries. Based on a dataset created in
an LLM-KG-Bench run covering 26 open state-of-the-art LLMs, we explore the
model size scaling laws specific to KGE tasks. In our analyses, we assess how
benchmark scores evolve between different model size categories. Additionally,
we inspect how the general score development of single models and families of
models correlates to their size. Our analyses revealed that, with a few
exceptions, the model size scaling laws generally also apply to the selected
KGE tasks. However, in some cases, plateau or ceiling effects occurred, i.e.,
the task performance did not change much between a model and the next larger
model. In these cases, smaller models could be considered to achieve high
cost-effectiveness. Regarding models of the same family, sometimes larger
models performed worse than smaller models of the same family. These effects
occurred only locally. Hence it is advisable to additionally test the next
smallest and largest model of the same family.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了II-KEA框架，解决了深度学习模型在电子健康记录（EHR）分析中缺乏解释性和交互性的问题，结合知识库和大型语言模型（LLM）提供更好的决策支持。

Motivation: 当前基于EHR的深度学习模型虽预测准确，但缺乏解释性和交互性，限制了临床医生的决策能力。

Method: 提出II-KEA框架，整合个性化知识库和代理LLM，通过显式推理和因果分析增强解释性，并提供交互机制允许医生注入知识。

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上验证，表现优越且解释性和交互性显著提升。

Conclusion: II-KEA框架有效解决了现有模型的限制，为临床决策提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR)
data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the
potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning.
However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value:
interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models
makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind
predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally,
the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating
their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address
these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal
discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and
agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and
causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to
inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and
prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating
superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as
evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies.

TL;DR: 论文提出EquivPruner方法，通过识别和剪枝语义等价动作，减少LLM推理中的冗余搜索，显著降低token消耗，并在数学推理任务中提升效率与准确性。

Motivation: 现有的语义相似方法难以准确识别领域特定上下文中的语义等价步骤，导致LLM推理中token消耗过高。

Method: 提出EquivPruner方法，利用MathEquiv数据集训练轻量级等价检测器，剪枝语义等价动作。

Result: 在GSM8K等任务中，EquivPruner显著减少48.1%的token消耗，同时提升推理准确性。

Conclusion: EquivPruner有效提升LLM推理效率与准确性，尤其在数学推理领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning through search
algorithms, yet current strategies often suffer from massive token consumption
due to redundant exploration of semantically equivalent steps. Existing
semantic similarity methods struggle to accurately identify such equivalence in
domain-specific contexts like mathematical reasoning. To address this, we
propose EquivPruner, a simple yet effective approach that identifies and prunes
semantically equivalent actions during LLM reasoning search. We also introduce
MathEquiv, the first dataset we created for mathematical statement equivalence,
which enables the training of a lightweight equivalence detector. Extensive
experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate that EquivPruner
significantly reduces token consumption, improving searching efficiency and
often bolstering reasoning accuracy. For instance, when applied to
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on GSM8K, EquivPruner reduced token consumption by
48.1\% while also improving accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但存在过度思考的问题，生成冗余内容。

Method: ACPO框架包含系统感知推理标记和在线难度估计，通过两阶段训练策略（监督微调和强化学习）实现高效推理。

Result: 实验表明，ACPO能减少冗余推理，并基于任务复杂度自适应调整认知分配，实现高效混合推理。

Conclusion: ACPO成功解决了LRMs的冗余推理问题，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, but often suffer from overthinking, generating redundant
content regardless of task difficulty. Inspired by the dual process theory in
cognitive science, we propose Adaptive Cognition Policy Optimization (ACPO), a
reinforcement learning framework that enables LRMs to achieve efficient
reasoning through adaptive cognitive allocation and dynamic system switch. ACPO
incorporates two key components: (1) introducing system-aware reasoning tokens
to explicitly represent the thinking modes thereby making the model's cognitive
process transparent, and (2) integrating online difficulty estimation and token
length budget to guide adaptive system switch and reasoning during
reinforcement learning. To this end, we propose a two-stage training strategy.
The first stage begins with supervised fine-tuning to cold start the model,
enabling it to generate reasoning paths with explicit thinking modes. In the
second stage, we apply ACPO to further enhance adaptive system switch for
difficulty-aware reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that ACPO
effectively reduces redundant reasoning while adaptively adjusting cognitive
allocation based on task complexity, achieving efficient hybrid reasoning.

Conclusion: 人类与AI的共同进化可能带来深远影响，未来研究应关注伦理与认知问题。

Abstract: The serious games between humans and AI have only just begun. Evolutionary
Game Theory (EGT) models the competitive and cooperative strategies of
biological entities. EGT could help predict the potential evolutionary
equilibrium of humans and AI. The objective of this work was to examine some of
the EGT models relevant to human-AI interaction, evolution, and coevolution. Of
thirteen EGT models considered, three were examined: the Hawk-Dove Game,
Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and the War of Attrition. This selection was based
on the widespread acceptance and clear relevance of these models to potential
human-AI evolutionary dynamics and coevolutionary trajectories. The Hawk-Dove
Game predicts balanced mixed-strategy equilibria based on the costs of
conflict. It also shows the potential for balanced coevolution rather than
dominance. Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma suggests that repeated interaction may
lead to cognitive coevolution. It demonstrates how memory and reciprocity can
lead to cooperation. The War of Attrition suggests that competition for
resources may result in strategic coevolution, asymmetric equilibria, and
conventions on sharing resources. Therefore, EGT may provide a suitable
framework to understand and predict the human-AI evolutionary dynamic. However,
future research could extend beyond EGT and explore additional frameworks,
empirical validation methods, and interdisciplinary perspectives. AI is being
shaped by human input and is evolving in response to it. So too,
neuroplasticity allows the human brain to grow and evolve in response to
stimuli. If humans and AI converge in future, what might be the result of human
neuroplasticity combined with an ever-evolving AI? Future research should be
mindful of the ethical and cognitive implications of human-AI interaction,
evolution, and coevolution.

TL;DR: FREESON框架通过将大型推理模型（LRM）同时作为生成器和检索器，避免了传统检索增强方法的局限性，显著提高了问答任务的性能。

Motivation: 现有检索增强推理方法依赖独立检索模型，导致硬件成本高和检索错误，限制了LRM的作用。

Method: 提出了FREESON框架和CT-MCTS算法，使LRM能自主检索相关知识。

Result: 在五个开放域问答基准上，FREESON平均提升14.4%的EM和F1，部分任务超过最强基线3%。

Conclusion: FREESON通过整合生成与检索功能，有效解决了检索瓶颈问题，提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
multi-step reasoning and calling search engines at appropriate steps. However,
existing retrieval-augmented reasoning approaches rely on separate retrieval
models, limiting the LRM's role in retrieval to deciding when to retrieve and
how to query. This separation not only increases hardware and operational costs
but also leads to errors in the retrieval process due to the representation
bottleneck, a phenomenon where the retriever's embedding space is not
expressive enough to meet the generator's requirements. To address this, we
shift our perspective from sequence-to-sequence matching to locating the
answer-containing paths within the corpus, and propose a novel framework called
FREESON (Retriever-FREE Retrieval-Augmented ReaSONing). This framework enables
LRMs to retrieve relevant knowledge on their own by acting as both a generator
and retriever. To achieve this, we introduce a variant of the MCTS algorithm
specialized for the retrieval task, which we call CT-MCTS (Corpus-Traversing
Monte Carlo Tree Search). In this algorithm, LRMs traverse through the corpus
toward answer-containing regions. Our results on five open-domain QA
benchmarks, including single-hop and multi-hop questions, show that FREESON
achieves an average improvement of 14.4% in EM and F1 over four multi-step
reasoning models with a separate retriever, and it also performs comparably to
the strongest baseline, surpassing it by 3% on PopQA and 2WikiMultihopQA.

Motivation: 探究推理模型中过度思考现象的成因及其解决方式。

Method: 通过解释性实验分析模型行为，并提出掩盖输入部分的方法。

Result: 掩盖输入部分可将推理长度减少31%-53%，并多数情况下提升准确性。

Conclusion: 内部偏见与过度思考存在因果关系。

Abstract: While current reasoning models possess strong exploratory capabilities, they
are often criticized for overthinking due to redundant and unnecessary
reflections. In this work, we reveal for the first time that overthinking in
reasoning models may stem from their internal bias towards input texts. Upon
encountering a reasoning problem, the model immediately forms a preliminary
guess about the answer, which we term as an internal bias since it is not
derived through actual reasoning. When this guess conflicts with its reasoning
result, the model tends to engage in reflection, leading to the waste of
computational resources. Through further interpretability experiments, we find
that this behavior is largely driven by the model's excessive attention to the
input section, which amplifies the influence of internal bias on its
decision-making process. Additionally, by masking out the original input
section, the affect of internal bias can be effectively alleviated and the
reasoning length could be reduced by 31%-53% across different complex reasoning
tasks. Notably, in most cases, this approach also leads to improvements in
accuracy. These findings demonstrate a causal relationship between internal
bias and overthinking.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从‘数据驱动拟合’到‘基于角色模拟与机制解释’的范式转变。

Abstract: During sudden disaster events, accurately predicting public panic sentiment
on social media is crucial for proactive governance and crisis management.
Current efforts on this problem face three main challenges: lack of finely
annotated data hinders emotion prediction studies, unmodeled risk perception
causes prediction inaccuracies, and insufficient interpretability of panic
formation mechanisms. We address these issues by proposing a Psychology-driven
generative Agent framework (PsychoAgent) for explainable panic prediction based
on emotion arousal theory. Specifically, we first construct a fine-grained open
panic emotion dataset (namely COPE) via human-large language models (LLMs)
collaboration to mitigate semantic bias. Then, we develop a framework
integrating cross-domain heterogeneous data grounded in psychological
mechanisms to model risk perception and cognitive differences in emotion
generation. To enhance interpretability, we design an LLM-based role-playing
agent that simulates individual psychological chains through dedicatedly
designed prompts. Experimental results on our annotated dataset show that
PsychoAgent improves panic emotion prediction performance by 12.6% to 21.7%
compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the explainability and generalization
of our approach is validated. Crucially, this represents a paradigm shift from
opaque "data-driven fitting" to transparent "role-based simulation with
mechanistic interpretation" for panic emotion prediction during emergencies.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的推理能力缺乏标准化评估基准，特别是带中间思考痕迹的模型。现有研究主要关注感知或最终答案正确性，未能深入分析模型的推理过程或失败原因。

Method: 引入MMMR基准，包括1）一个包含1,083个高难度问题的数据集，涵盖六种推理类型；2）模块化的推理痕迹评估管道（RTEP），通过相关性、一致性等指标评估推理质量。

Result: 实验显示，MLLMs-T总体上优于非思考模型，但即使顶尖模型（如Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Gemini-2.5 Pro）也存在不一致性和过度思考等推理问题。

Conclusion: MMMR为评估和改进下一代多模态推理系统提供了可扩展的基础，揭示了准确性与推理质量之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled
unified processing of language, vision, and structured inputs, opening the door
to complex tasks such as logical deduction, spatial reasoning, and scientific
analysis. Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs,
particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T),
remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing
work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering
limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address
this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a
high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types
with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace
Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy
through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations.
Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking
counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro
suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This
benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and
provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development.
Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and
improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 证明反射学习可以显著提升SLMs的推理能力，且无需依赖大模型蒸馏或精细人工标注。

Abstract: We present a novel pipeline, ReflectEvo, to demonstrate that small language

process iteratively generates self-reflection for self-training, fostering a
continuous and self-evolving process. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct
ReflectEvo-460k, a large-scale, comprehensive, self-generated reflection
dataset with broadened instructions and diverse multi-domain tasks. Building
upon this dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of reflection learning to
improve SLMs' reasoning abilities using SFT and DPO with remarkable
performance, substantially boosting Llama-3 from 52.4% to 71.2% and Mistral
from 44.4% to 71.1%. It validates that ReflectEvo can rival or even surpass the
reasoning capability of the three prominent open-sourced models on BIG-bench
without distillation from superior models or fine-grained human annotation. We
further conduct a deeper analysis of the high quality of self-generated
reflections and their impact on error localization and correction. Our work
highlights the potential of continuously enhancing the reasoning performance of
SLMs through iterative reflection learning in the long run.

Abstract: With recent Nobel Prizes recognising AI contributions to science, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific research by enhancing
productivity and reshaping the scientific method. LLMs are now involved in
experimental design, data analysis, and workflows, particularly in chemistry
and biology. However, challenges such as hallucinations and reliability
persist. In this contribution, we review how Large Language Models (LLMs) are
redefining the scientific method and explore their potential applications
across different stages of the scientific cycle, from hypothesis testing to
discovery. We conclude that, for LLMs to serve as relevant and effective
creative engines and productivity enhancers, their deep integration into all
steps of the scientific process should be pursued in collaboration and
alignment with human scientific goals, with clear evaluation metrics. The
transition to AI-driven science raises ethical questions about creativity,
oversight, and responsibility. With careful guidance, LLMs could evolve into
creative engines, driving transformative breakthroughs across scientific
disciplines responsibly and effectively. However, the scientific community must
also decide how much it leaves to LLMs to drive science, even when associations
with 'reasoning', mostly currently undeserved, are made in exchange for the
potential to explore hypothesis and solution regions that might otherwise
remain unexplored by human exploration alone.

Abstract: Recently, Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs) that leveraged the
advantage of wireless energy transfer technology have opened a promising
opportunity in solving the limited energy issue. However, an ineffective
charging strategy may reduce the charging performance. Although many practical
charging algorithms have been introduced, these studies mainly focus on
optimizing the charging path with a fully charging approach. This approach may
lead to the death of a series of sensors due to their extended charging
latency. This paper introduces a novel partial charging approach that follows a
bi-level optimized scheme to minimize energy depletion in WRSNs. We aim at
optimizing simultaneously two factors: the charging path and time. To
accomplish this, we first formulate a mathematical model of the investigated
problem. We then propose two approximate algorithms in which the optimization
of the charging path and the charging time are considered as the upper and
lower level, respectively. The first algorithm combines a Multi-start Local
Search method and a Genetic Algorithm to find a solution. The second algorithm
adopts a nested approach that utilizes the advantages of the Multitasking and
Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies. Experimental validations
on various network scenarios demonstrate that our proposed algorithms
outperform the existing works.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了不完全论证框架（IAF）中一组论证的验证状态的稳定性相关性问题，并提出了强相关性的新概念，分析了其计算复杂度。

Motivation: 扩展Odekerken等人提出的单个论证的合理性状态稳定性相关性的概念，研究一组论证的验证状态稳定性。

Method: 提出稳定性相关性和强相关性的定义，并分析其在多种语义下的计算复杂度。

Result: 在大多数语义下，检测（强）相关性的复杂度为P时间，但在基础语义下难以找到高效方法。

Conclusion: 研究为IAF中论证集稳定性的相关问题提供了理论支持，并指出了基础语义下的复杂性挑战。

Abstract: The notion of relevance was proposed for stability of justification status of
a single argument in incomplete argumentation frameworks (IAFs) in 2024 by
Odekerken et al. To extend the notion, we study the relevance for stability of
verification status of a set of arguments in this paper, i.e., the
uncertainties in an IAF that have to be resolved in some situations so that
answering whether a given set of arguments is an extension obtains the same
result in every completion of the IAF. Further we propose the notion of strong
relevance for describing the necessity of resolution in all situations reaching
stability. An analysis of complexity reveals that detecting the (strong)
relevance for stability of sets of arguments can be accomplished in P time
under the most semantics discussed in the paper. We also discuss the difficulty
in finding tractable methods for relevance detection under grounded semantics.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了GRASSLAND，一个用于评估动态空间推理的迷宫导航基准，并提出无需训练的框架D2R，通过结合文本推理链和动态视觉草稿，显著提升多模态大语言模型在动态空间推理任务中的性能。

Motivation: 现有方法在动态空间推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是在多模态大语言模型中，因此需要一种新的方法来提升动态环境下的空间推理能力。

Method: 提出了D2R框架，通过将文本推理链与动态视觉草稿结合，直接应用于输入图像，无需训练即可增强模型的动态空间推理能力。

Conclusion: D2R框架为动态空间推理提供了一种高效且无需训练的方法，在多模态大语言模型中展现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: While chains-of-thought (CoT) have advanced complex reasoning in multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), existing methods remain confined to text or
static visual domains, often faltering in dynamic spatial reasoning tasks. To
bridge this gap, we present GRASSLAND, a novel maze navigation benchmark
designed to evaluate dynamic spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that
augmenting textual reasoning chains with dynamic visual drafts, overlaid on
input images, significantly outperforms conventional approaches, offering new
insights into spatial reasoning in evolving environments. To generalize this
capability, we propose D2R (Dynamic Draft-Augmented Reasoning), a training-free
framework that seamlessly integrates textual CoT with corresponding visual
drafts into MLLMs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that D2R consistently
enhances performance across diverse tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
dynamic spatial reasoning without requiring model fine-tuning. Project is open

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently seen transformative breakthroughs
in the life sciences, expanding possibilities for researchers to interpret
biological information at an unprecedented capacity, with novel applications
and advances being made almost daily. In order to maximise return on the
growing investments in AI-based life science research and accelerate this
progress, it has become urgent to address the exacerbation of long-standing
research challenges arising from the rapid adoption of AI methods. We review
the increased erosion of trust in AI research outputs, driven by the issues of
poor reusability and reproducibility, and highlight their consequent impact on
environmental sustainability. Furthermore, we discuss the fragmented components
of the AI ecosystem and lack of guiding pathways to best support Open and
Sustainable AI (OSAI) model development. In response, this perspective
introduces a practical set of OSAI recommendations directly mapped to over 300

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMART框架用于多维评估大型语言模型的数学能力，解构为理解、推理、算术和反思四个维度。

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型的数学推理能力是否仅仅是表面模式识别，而非真正的数学推理。

Method: 提出SMART框架，通过自我生成和自我验证的机制，对四个维度分别评估。

Result: 应用于21个LLM，发现它们在四个维度上的能力差异显著。

Conclusion: 最终答案准确性不足作为唯一指标，需采用新的全面性指标。

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved remarkable results on a variety of
mathematical benchmarks. However, concerns remain as to whether these successes
reflect genuine mathematical reasoning or superficial pattern recognition.
Common evaluation metrics, such as final answer accuracy, fail to disentangle
the underlying competencies involved, offering limited diagnostic value. To
address these limitations, we introduce SMART: a Self-Generating and
Self-Validating Multi-Dimensional Assessment Framework. SMART decomposes
mathematical problem solving into four distinct dimensions: understanding,
reasoning, arithmetic, and reflection \& refinement. Each dimension is
evaluated independently through tailored tasks, enabling interpretable and
fine-grained analysis of LLM behavior. Crucially, SMART integrates an automated
self-generating and self-validating mechanism to produce and verify benchmark
data, ensuring both scalability and reliability. We apply SMART to 21
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs, uncovering significant
discrepancies in their abilities across different dimensions. Our findings
demonstrate the inadequacy of final answer accuracy as a sole metric and
motivate a new holistic metric to better capture true problem-solving
capabilities. Code and benchmarks will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: While recent research increasingly emphasizes the value of human-LLM
collaboration in competitive programming and proposes numerous empirical
methods, a comprehensive understanding remains elusive due to the fragmented
nature of existing studies and their use of diverse, application-specific human
feedback. Thus, our work serves a three-fold purpose: First, we present the
first taxonomy of human feedback consolidating the entire programming process,
which promotes fine-grained evaluation. Second, we introduce ELABORATIONSET, a
novel programming dataset specifically designed for human-LLM collaboration,
meticulously annotated to enable large-scale simulated human feedback and
facilitate costeffective real human interaction studies. Third, we introduce
ELABORATION, a novel benchmark to facilitate a thorough assessment of human-LLM
competitive programming. With ELABORATION, we pinpoint strengthes and
weaknesses of existing methods, thereby setting the foundation for future
improvement. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: SPaRC数据集旨在测试空间和符号推理能力，现有模型在处理复杂路径规划问题时表现不佳，而人类则接近完美。

Motivation: 现有推理数据集无法有效测试抽象、多步骤问题，尤其是路径规划和复杂规则约束的满足。

Method: 引入了包含1,000个2D网格路径规划谜题的SPaRC数据集，要求基于算术和几何规则进行逐步规划。

Result: 人类准确率高达98.0%（困难谜题为94.5%），而最佳模型（如o4-mini）仅为15.8%（困难谜题为1.1%），且常生成无效路径。

Conclusion: 模型在空间逻辑和导航方面存在不足，未来可通过改进训练和测试时计算效率来提升性能。

Abstract: Existing reasoning datasets saturate and fail to test abstract, multi-step
problems, especially pathfinding and complex rule constraint satisfaction. We
introduce SPaRC (Spatial Pathfinding Reasoning Challenge), a dataset of 1,000
2D grid pathfinding puzzles to evaluate spatial and symbolic reasoning,
requiring step-by-step planning with arithmetic and geometric rules. Humans
achieve near-perfect accuracy (98.0%; 94.5% on hard puzzles), while the best
reasoning models, such as o4-mini, struggle (15.8%; 1.1% on hard puzzles).
Models often generate invalid paths (>50% of puzzles for o4-mini), and
reasoning tokens reveal they make errors in navigation and spatial logic.
Unlike humans, who take longer on hard puzzles, models fail to scale test-time
compute with difficulty. Allowing models to make multiple solution attempts
improves accuracy, suggesting potential for better spatial reasoning with
improved training and efficient test-time scaling methods. SPaRC can be used as
a window into models' spatial reasoning limitations and drive research toward
new methods that excel in abstract, multi-step problem-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCP-RADAR是首个专门为评估LLM在MCP框架下的性能而设计的综合基准，通过五个维度的客观量化指标，挑战传统单一指标排名。

Motivation: 由于现有评估方法无法有效衡量LLM在工具利用能力上的表现，开发了MCP-RADAR以填补这一空白。

Method: 采用五维评估方法（答案准确性、工具选择效率、资源效率、参数构建准确性、执行速度），在多个任务领域进行测试。

Result: 评估揭示了不同LLM在准确性、效率和速度之间的显著权衡，为开发者提供了工具优化的指导。

Conclusion: MCP-RADAR不仅适用于MCP框架，还可推广到其他LLM工具集成框架，为优化LLM与工具的交互生态系统提供参考。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve from passive text generators to active
reasoning agents capable of tool interaction, the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
has emerged as a standardized framework for dynamic tool discovery and
orchestration. Despite widespread industry adoption, existing evaluation
methodologies fail to adequately assess tool utilization capabilities within
this new paradigm. This paper introduces MCP-RADAR, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in the MCP
framework through a novel five-dimensional approach measuring: answer accuracy,
tool selection efficiency, computational resource efficiency, parameter
construction accuracy, and execution speed. Unlike conventional benchmarks that
rely on subjective human evaluations or binary success metrics, MCP-RADAR
employs objective, quantifiable measurements across multiple task domains
including software engineering, mathematical reasoning, and general
problem-solving. Our evaluations of leading commercial and open-source LLMs
reveal distinctive capability profiles with significant trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and speed, challenging traditional single-metric
performance rankings. Besides, we provide valuable guidance for developers to
optimize their tools for maximum model compatibility and effectiveness. While
focused on MCP due to its standardized approach, our methodology remains
applicable across all LLM agent tool integration frameworks, providing valuable
insights for both LLM developers and tool creators to optimize the entire
LLM-tool interaction ecosystem. The implementation, configurations, and
datasets used in our evaluation are publicly available at

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive synthesis of major breakthroughs in
artificial intelligence (AI) over the past fifteen years, integrating
historical, theoretical, and technological perspectives. It identifies key
inflection points in AI' s evolution by tracing the convergence of
computational resources, data access, and algorithmic innovation. The analysis
highlights how researchers enabled GPU based model training, triggered a data
centric shift with ImageNet, simplified architectures through the Transformer,
and expanded modeling capabilities with the GPT series. Rather than treating
these advances as isolated milestones, the paper frames them as indicators of
deeper paradigm shifts. By applying concepts from statistical learning theory
such as sample complexity and data efficiency, the paper explains how
researchers translated breakthroughs into scalable solutions and why the field
must now embrace data centric approaches. In response to rising privacy
concerns and tightening regulations, the paper evaluates emerging solutions
like federated learning, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), and the data
site paradigm, which reframe data access and security. In cases where real
world data remains inaccessible, the paper also assesses the utility and
constraints of mock and synthetic data generation. By aligning technical
insights with evolving data infrastructure, this study offers strategic
guidance for future AI research and policy development.

Motivation: 传统的意见动力学模型难以处理群体决策中的不确定性、动态社会结构和模糊信息，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 引入三支决策机制建模犹豫和模糊性，开发基于意见相似性的连接调整规则，使用语言术语描述意见，并构建集成多智能体决策框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂动态环境中的群体决策提供了有效解决方案，能够更好地处理不确定性、模糊性和动态性。

Abstract: In group decision-making (GDM) scenarios, uncertainty, dynamic social
structures, and vague information present major challenges for traditional
opinion dynamics models. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel
social network group decision-making (SNGDM) framework that integrates
three-way decision (3WD) theory, dynamic network reconstruction, and linguistic
opinion representation. First, the 3WD mechanism is introduced to explicitly
model hesitation and ambiguity in agent judgments, thereby preventing
irrational decisions. Second, a connection adjustment rule based on opinion
similarity is developed, enabling agents to adaptively update their
communication links and better reflect the evolving nature of social
relationships. Third, linguistic terms are used to describe agent opinions,
allowing the model to handle subjective, vague, or incomplete information more
effectively. Finally, an integrated multi-agent decision-making framework is
constructed, which simultaneously considers individual uncertainty, opinion
evolution, and network dynamics. The proposed model is applied to a multi-UAV
cooperative decision-making scenario, where simulation results and consensus
analysis demonstrate its effectiveness. Experimental comparisons further verify
the advantages of the algorithm in enhancing system stability and representing
realistic decision-making behaviors.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于模型强化学习（MBRL）的新方法，通过主动寻找高熵状态来优化世界模型的训练，从而提升样本效率和策略性能。

Motivation: 现有的MBRL方法主要关注策略优化，而忽视了世界模型的学习效率。通过提升世界模型的准确性并加速其收敛，可以显著提升策略的最终性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于短时潜在预测的主动探索方法，动态调整规划层次、规划长度以及奖励与熵的权重，避免传统好奇心驱动方法的低效。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在Miniworld迷宫任务中比基础Dreamer方法收敛快50%，且策略训练所需的步骤仅为Dreamer的60%。

Conclusion: 通过优化世界模型的学习并动态调整规划策略，可以显著提升MBRL方法的效率和性能。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers an intuitive way to increase
the sample efficiency of model-free RL methods by simultaneously training a
world model that learns to predict the future. MBRL methods have progressed by
largely prioritising the actor; optimising the world model learning has been
neglected meanwhile. Improving the fidelity of the world model and reducing its
time to convergence can yield significant downstream benefits, one of which is
improving the ensuing performance of any actor it may train. We propose a novel
approach that anticipates and actively seeks out high-entropy states using
short-horizon latent predictions generated by the world model, offering a
principled alternative to traditional curiosity-driven methods that chase
once-novel states well after they were stumbled into. While many model
predictive control (MPC) based methods offer similar alternatives, they
typically lack commitment, synthesising multi step plans after every step. To
mitigate this, we present a hierarchical planner that dynamically decides when
to replan, planning horizon length, and the weighting between reward and
entropy. While our method can theoretically be applied to any model that trains
its own actors with solely model generated data, we have applied it to just
Dreamer as a proof of concept. Our method finishes the Miniworld procedurally
generated mazes 50% faster than base Dreamer at convergence and the policy
trained in imagination converges in only 60% of the environment steps that base
Dreamer needs.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法（如GRPO及其变体DAPO）在计算优势时存在粗粒度问题，无法捕捉令牌级别的贡献，影响了学习效果。

Method: 提出了KTAE算法，利用采样的正确性和统计分析量化令牌的重要性，结合rollout级优势，实现细粒度的令牌级优势估计。

Result: 实验表明，使用GRPO+KTAE和DAPO+KTAE的模型在五个数学推理基准上优于基线方法，且能以更短的响应实现更高准确率。

Conclusion: KTAE算法通过细粒度的优势估计显著提升了模型的推理能力，尤其在数学任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated that integrating reinforcement learning
with rule-based rewards can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, even without supervised fine-tuning. However, prevalent
reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO and its variants like DAPO,
suffer from a coarse granularity issue when computing the advantage.
Specifically, they compute rollout-level advantages that assign identical
values to every token within a sequence, failing to capture token-specific
contributions and hindering effective learning. To address this limitation, we
propose Key-token Advantage Estimation (KTAE) - a novel algorithm that
estimates fine-grained, token-level advantages without introducing additional
models. KTAE leverages the correctness of sampled rollouts and applies
statistical analysis to quantify the importance of individual tokens within a
sequence to the final outcome. This quantified token-level importance is then
combined with the rollout-level advantage to obtain a more fine-grained
token-level advantage estimation. Empirical results show that models trained
with GRPO+KTAE and DAPO+KTAE outperform baseline methods across five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Notably, they achieve higher accuracy with
shorter responses and even surpass R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B using the same base
model.

Abstract: GUI automation faces critical challenges in dynamic environments. MLLMs
suffer from two key issues: misinterpreting UI components and outdated
knowledge. Traditional fine-tuning methods are costly for app-specific
knowledge updates. We propose GUI-explorer, a training-free GUI agent that
incorporates two fundamental mechanisms: (1) Autonomous Exploration of
Function-aware Trajectory. To comprehensively cover all application
functionalities, we design a Function-aware Task Goal Generator that
automatically constructs exploration goals by analyzing GUI structural
information (e.g., screenshots and activity hierarchies). This enables
systematic exploration to collect diverse trajectories. (2) Unsupervised Mining
of Transition-aware Knowledge. To establish precise screen-operation logic, we
develop a Transition-aware Knowledge Extractor that extracts effective
screen-operation logic through unsupervised analysis the state transition of
structured interaction triples (observation, action, outcome). This eliminates
the need for human involvement in knowledge extraction. With a task success
rate of 53.7% on SPA-Bench and 47.4% on AndroidWorld, GUI-explorer shows
significant improvements over SOTA agents. It requires no parameter updates for
new apps. GUI-explorer is open-sourced and publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EduVisBench，一个用于评估基础模型在教学中生成视觉解释能力的多领域、多层次基准，并提出了EduVisAgent框架，通过多智能体协作显著提升视觉推理能力。

Motivation: 基础模型在教学中生成教育有效视觉解释的能力有限，现有方法多关注文本推理，忽视了结构化可视化的作用。

Method: 提出EduVisBench基准和EduVisAgent框架，后者通过多智能体协作分解复杂推理并设计可视化。

Result: EduVisAgent性能显著优于基线，提升40.2%，生成更符合教育需求的可视化。

Conclusion: EduVisBench和EduVisAgent为教育视觉推理提供了有效工具和基准支持。

Abstract: While foundation models (FMs), such as diffusion models and large
vision-language models (LVLMs), have been widely applied in educational
contexts, their ability to generate pedagogically effective visual explanations
remains limited. Most existing approaches focus primarily on textual reasoning,
overlooking the critical role of structured and interpretable visualizations in
supporting conceptual understanding. To better assess the visual reasoning
capabilities of FMs in educational settings, we introduce EduVisBench, a
multi-domain, multi-level benchmark. EduVisBench features diverse STEM problem
sets requiring visually grounded solutions, along with a fine-grained
evaluation rubric informed by pedagogical theory. Our empirical analysis
reveals that existing models frequently struggle with the inherent challenge of
decomposing complex reasoning and translating it into visual representations
aligned with human cognitive processes. To address these limitations, we
propose EduVisAgent, a multi-agent collaborative framework that coordinates
specialized agents for instructional planning, reasoning decomposition,
metacognitive prompting, and visualization design. Experimental results show
that EduVisAgent substantially outperforms all baselines, achieving a 40.2%
improvement and delivering more educationally aligned visualizations.

### [301] [Think or Not? Selective Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16854)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TON的两阶段训练策略，通过结合监督微调和GRPO方法，使视觉语言模型能够选择性推理，显著降低计算成本而不会牺牲性能。

Motivation: 受人类选择性思考的启发，研究如何让视觉语言模型在推理前判断是否需要完整推理，以减少不必要的计算开销。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：SFT阶段引入“thought dropout”操作；GRPO阶段允许模型探索何时跳过推理。

Result: TON比传统GRPO减少90%的推理长度，同时保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: TON方法为实现类人推理模式提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be an effective post-training
strategy for enhancing reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that
encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering,
leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the
human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but
think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when
reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training
strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective
'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with
empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold
start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to
freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome
rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by
up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even
improving it. Further evaluations across diverse vision-language tasks-covering
a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently
reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning
steps as training advances. These findings shed light on the path toward
human-like reasoning patterns in reinforcement learning approaches. Our code is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为CondKGCP的新方法，用于在知识图谱嵌入中实现更强的谓词条件覆盖保证，同时保持预测集的紧凑性。

Motivation: 在知识图谱嵌入方法中，不确定性量化对下游应用的可靠性至关重要。现有的方法仅提供平均覆盖保证，而高应用如医疗诊断需要更强的条件覆盖保证。

Method: CondKGCP通过合并具有相似向量表示的谓词，并利用秩信息增强校准，近似实现谓词条件覆盖保证。

Result: 实验证明，CondKGCP能够有效提供条件覆盖保证，同时保持预测集的紧凑性。

Conclusion: CondKGCP在理论上和实践中均表现出色，适用于需要强覆盖保证的应用场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods is
crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. A recent work
applies conformal prediction to KGE methods, providing uncertainty estimates by
generating a set of answers that is guaranteed to include the true answer with
a predefined confidence level. However, existing methods provide probabilistic
guarantees averaged over a reference set of queries and answers (marginal
coverage guarantee). In high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis, a
stronger guarantee is often required: the predicted sets must provide
consistent coverage per query (conditional coverage guarantee). We propose
CondKGCP, a novel method that approximates predicate-conditional coverage
guarantees while maintaining compact prediction sets. CondKGCP merges
predicates with similar vector representations and augments calibration with
rank information. We prove the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirical
effectiveness of CondKGCP by comprehensive evaluations.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have historically been used as tools
that execute narrowly defined tasks. Yet recent advances in AI have unlocked
possibilities for a new class of models that genuinely collaborate with humans
in complex reasoning, from conceptualizing problems to brainstorming solutions.
Such AI thought partners enable novel forms of collaboration and extended
cognition, yet they also pose major risks-including and beyond risks of typical
AI tools and agents. In this commentary, we systematically identify risks of AI
thought partners through a novel framework that identifies risks at multiple
levels of analysis, including Real-time, Individual, and Societal risks arising
from collaborative cognition (RISc). We leverage this framework to propose
concrete metrics for risk evaluation, and finally suggest specific mitigation
strategies for developers and policymakers. As AI thought partners continue to
proliferate, these strategies can help prevent major harms and ensure that
humans actively benefit from productive thought partnerships.

Abstract: We introduce $\infty$-THOR, a new framework for long-horizon embodied tasks
that advances long-context understanding in embodied AI. $\infty$-THOR
provides: (1) a generation framework for synthesizing scalable, reproducible,
and unlimited long-horizon trajectories; (2) a novel embodied QA task,
Needle(s) in the Embodied Haystack, where multiple scattered clues across
extended trajectories test agents' long-context reasoning ability; and (3) a
long-horizon dataset and benchmark suite featuring complex tasks that span
hundreds of environment steps, each paired with ground-truth action sequences.
To enable this capability, we explore architectural adaptations, including
interleaved Goal-State-Action modeling, context extension techniques, and
Context Parallelism, to equip LLM-based agents for extreme long-context
reasoning and interaction. Experimental results and analyses highlight the
challenges posed by our benchmark and provide insights into training strategies
and model behaviors under long-horizon conditions. Our work provides a
foundation for the next generation of embodied AI systems capable of robust,
long-term reasoning and planning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AgentIF，首个系统性评估大语言模型（LLM）在代理场景中指令遵循能力的基准，具有真实性、长度和复杂性三大特征。通过分析现有模型的不足，为未来研究提供了方向。

Motivation: 代理场景中的指令通常冗长且复杂，但LLM是否可靠遵循此类指令尚不明确，因此需要系统性评估工具。

Method: 构建了基于50个真实代理应用的AgentIF基准，包含707条人工标注指令，并采用多种评估方法（代码、LLM和混合）。

Result: 现有LLM表现不佳，尤其在处理复杂约束和工具规范时。实验揭示了模型的失败模式与指令长度、元约束的关系。

Conclusion: AgentIF为LLM指令遵循能力研究提供了重要基准，现有模型需进一步改进以应对复杂代理任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in
real-world agentic applications. Growing research efforts aim to develop
LLM-based agents to address practical demands, introducing a new challenge:
agentic scenarios often involve lengthy instructions with complex constraints,
such as extended system prompts and detailed tool specifications. While
adherence to such instructions is crucial for agentic applications, whether
LLMs can reliably follow them remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce AgentIF, the first benchmark for systematically evaluating LLM
instruction following ability in agentic scenarios. AgentIF features three key
characteristics: (1) Realistic, constructed from 50 real-world agentic
applications. (2) Long, averaging 1,723 words with a maximum of 15,630 words.
(3) Complex, averaging 11.9 constraints per instruction, covering diverse
constraint types, such as tool specifications and condition constraints. To
construct AgentIF, we collect 707 human-annotated instructions across 50
agentic tasks from industrial application agents and open-source agentic
systems. For each instruction, we annotate the associated constraints and
corresponding evaluation metrics, including code-based evaluation, LLM-based
evaluation, and hybrid code-LLM evaluation. We use AgentIF to systematically
evaluate existing advanced LLMs. We observe that current models generally
perform poorly, especially in handling complex constraint structures and tool
specifications. We further conduct error analysis and analytical experiments on
instruction length and meta constraints, providing some findings about the
failure modes of existing LLMs. We have released the code and data to
facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在少样本语法生成中的表现，发现其能力不足，并提出了一种混合遗传算法HyGenar以优化性能。

Motivation: 语法在自然语言处理和文本/代码生成中至关重要，但LLMs在语法推断和生成方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入了包含540个语法生成挑战的数据集，设计了6个评估指标，并测试了8种LLMs，最终提出HyGenar算法。

Result: 现有LLMs在语法生成中表现不佳，HyGenar显著提升了生成语法的句法和语义正确性。

Conclusion: HyGenar为LLMs在语法生成任务中提供了有效优化方案。

Abstract: Grammar plays a critical role in natural language processing and text/code
generation by enabling the definition of syntax, the creation of parsers, and
guiding structured outputs. Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate
impressive capabilities across domains, their ability to infer and generate
grammars has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this paper, we aim to study
and improve the ability of LLMs for few-shot grammar generation, where grammars
are inferred from sets of a small number of positive and negative examples and
generated in Backus-Naur Form. To explore this, we introduced a novel dataset
comprising 540 structured grammar generation challenges, devised 6 metrics, and
evaluated 8 various LLMs against it. Our findings reveal that existing LLMs
perform sub-optimally in grammar generation. To address this, we propose an
LLM-driven hybrid genetic algorithm, namely HyGenar, to optimize grammar
generation. HyGenar achieves substantial improvements in both the syntactic and
semantic correctness of generated grammars across LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KtR框架通过递归分解任务和针对性增强，解决了单智能体LLM的局限性，提升了多智能体协作的效率。

Motivation: 单智能体LLM在上下文有限、角色过载和领域迁移脆弱性方面存在硬性限制，而传统的多智能体方法又引入了新的问题。

Method: KtR框架将领域先验转化为算法蓝图层次，递归分解任务为类型化、控制器介导的子任务，并结合轻量级增强（如思维链、微调、自检）。

Result: 在背包问题（3-8项）中，准确率从3%提升至95%；在任务分配问题（6-15项）中，准确率从11%提升至100%或84%。

Conclusion: KtR通过算法感知分解和针对性增强，使小型模型也能成为可靠协作伙伴，无需依赖更大的单体模型。

Abstract: Single-agent LLMs hit hard limits--finite context, role overload, and brittle
domain transfer. Conventional multi-agent fixes soften those edges yet expose
fresh pains: ill-posed decompositions, fuzzy contracts, and verification
overhead that blunts the gains. We therefore present Know-The-Ropes (KtR), a
framework that converts domain priors into an algorithmic blueprint hierarchy,
in which tasks are recursively split into typed, controller-mediated subtasks,
each solved zero-shot or with the lightest viable boost (e.g.,
chain-of-thought, micro-tune, self-check). Grounded in the No-Free-Lunch
theorem, KtR trades the chase for a universal prompt for disciplined
decomposition. On the Knapsack problem (3-8 items), three GPT-4o-mini agents
raise accuracy from 3% zero-shot to 95% on size-5 instances after patching a
single bottleneck agent. On the tougher Task-Assignment problem (6-15 jobs), a
six-agent o3-mini blueprint hits 100% up to size 10 and 84% on sizes 13-15,
versus 11% zero-shot. Algorithm-aware decomposition plus targeted augmentation
thus turns modest models into reliable collaborators--no ever-larger monoliths
required.

Motivation: 当前生物医学中的LLMs主要依赖相关性而非因果性，限制了其在如药物发现、个性化医疗等领域的应用潜力。

Method: 通过设计可控的代理框架、开发因果评估基准、整合多源数据，结合知识图谱和因果推理工具，构建因果LLM代理。

Result: 预期开发的代理能自动化生成假设、模拟药物发现，并通过个性化因果模型推动精准医疗。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in biomedicine but lack true causal
understanding, relying instead on correlations. This paper envisions causal LLM
agents that integrate multimodal data (text, images, genomics, etc.) and
perform intervention-based reasoning to infer cause-and-effect. Addressing this
requires overcoming key challenges: designing safe, controllable agentic
frameworks; developing rigorous benchmarks for causal evaluation; integrating
heterogeneous data sources; and synergistically combining LLMs with structured
knowledge (KGs) and formal causal inference tools. Such agents could unlock
transformative opportunities, including accelerating drug discovery through
automated hypothesis generation and simulation, enabling personalized medicine
through patient-specific causal models. This research agenda aims to foster
interdisciplinary efforts, bridging causal concepts and foundation models to
develop reliable AI partners for biomedical progress.

Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的多智能体系统受限于单一模型的能力，研究异构LLM驱动的MAS以突破这一限制。

Result: 异构配置在聊天机器人场景中性能提升8.4%，混合场景中推理任务提升47%。

Conclusion: 异构LLM驱动的MAS在无需结构改造下，显著提升系统性能，为AI协作系统提供新方向。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) extend the capabilities of single LLMs by
enabling cooperation among multiple specialized agents. However, most existing
MAS frameworks rely on a single LLM to drive all agents, constraining the
system's intelligence to the limit of that model. This paper explores the
paradigm of heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS (X-MAS), where agents are powered by
diverse LLMs, elevating the system's potential to the collective intelligence
of diverse LLMs. We introduce X-MAS-Bench, a comprehensive testbed designed to
evaluate the performance of various LLMs across different domains and
MAS-related functions. As an extensive empirical study, we assess 27 LLMs
across 5 domains (encompassing 21 test sets) and 5 functions, conducting over
1.7 million evaluations to identify optimal model selections for each
domain-function combination. Building on these findings, we demonstrate that
transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous LLM-driven MAS can
significantly enhance system performance without requiring structural redesign.
Specifically, in a chatbot-only MAS scenario, the heterogeneous configuration
yields up to 8.4\% performance improvement on the MATH dataset. In a mixed
chatbot-reasoner scenario, the heterogeneous MAS could achieve a remarkable
47\% performance boost on the AIME dataset. Our results underscore the
transformative potential of heterogeneous LLMs in MAS, highlighting a promising
avenue for advancing scalable, collaborative AI systems.

Result: BCPG-NSA在多个数学/编程推理基准测试中表现优于基线方法，提高了样本效率，且具有稳健性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: BCPG-NSA框架有效挖掘负样本中的潜在学习信号，为推理模型的训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift
from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of
rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets
becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable
components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary
existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply
equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential
learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy
Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline
RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2)
consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and
3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps
within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms
baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the
same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating
robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Conclusion: 基于图抽象的优化方法能有效提升网络节能效果。

Abstract: With increased 5G deployments, network densification is higher than ever to
support the exponentially high throughput requirements. However, this has meant
a significant increase in energy consumption, leading to higher operational
expenditure (OpEx) for network operators creating an acute need for
improvements in network energy savings (NES). A key determinant of operational
efficacy in cellular networks is the user association (UA) policy, as it
affects critical aspects like spectral efficiency, load balancing etc. and
therefore impacts the overall energy consumption of the network directly.
Furthermore, with cellular network topologies lending themselves well to
graphical abstractions, use of graphs in network optimization has gained
significant prominence. In this work, we propose and analyze a graphical
abstraction based optimization for UA in cellular networks to improve NES by
determining when energy saving features like cell switch off can be activated.
A comparison with legacy approaches establishes the superiority of the proposed
approach.

Result: 该框架为6G网络提供了协调分布智能的能力，但需要平衡模型与系统性能。

Conclusion: 复合AI系统在6G网络中仍需解决跨域资源编排、动态拓扑适应和服务质量一致性等挑战。

Abstract: The 3D continuum presents a complex environment that spans the terrestrial,
aerial and space domains, with 6Gnetworks serving as a key enabling technology.
Current AI approaches for network management rely on monolithic models that
fail to capture cross-domain interactions, lack adaptability,and demand
prohibitive computational resources. This paper presents a formal model of
Compound AI systems, introducing a novel tripartite framework that decomposes
complex tasks into specialized, interoperable modules. The proposed modular
architecture provides essential capabilities to address the unique challenges
of 6G networks in the 3D continuum, where heterogeneous components require
coordinated, yet distributed, intelligence. This approach introduces a
fundamental trade-off between model and system performance, which must be
carefully addressed. Furthermore, we identify key challenges faced by Compound
AI systems within 6G networks operating in the 3D continuum, including
cross-domain resource orchestration, adaptation to dynamic topologies, and the
maintenance of consistent AI service quality across heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quality of experience (QoE)-aware resource
allocation problem for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
digital twin (DT) interaction with uncertain evolution. In the considered
system, mobile users are expected to interact with a DT model maintained on a
DT server that is deployed on a base station, via effective uplink and downlink
channels assisted by an RIS. Our goal is to maximize the sum of all mobile
users' joint subjective and objective QoE in DT interactions across various DT
scenes, by jointly optimizing phase shift matrix, receive/transmit beamforming
matrix, rendering resolution configuration and computing resource allocation.
While solving this problem is challenging mainly due to the uncertain evolution
of the DT model, which leads to multiple scene-specific problems, and require
us to constantly re-solve each of them whenever DT model evolves.
  To this end, leveraging the dynamic optimization capabilities of decision
transformers and the generalization strengths of generative artificial
intelligence (GAI), we propose a novel GAI-aided approach, called the
prompt-guided decision transformer integrated with zero-forcing optimization
(PG-ZFO). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the proposed PG-ZFO,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over counterparts.

Abstract: Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) based indoor positioning is a widely researched area
for determining the position of devices within a wireless network. Accurate
indoor location has numerous applications, such as asset tracking and indoor
navigation. Despite advances in WiFi localization techniques -- in particular
approaches that leverage WiFi telemetry -- their adoption in practice remains
limited due to several factors including environmental changes that cause
signal fading, multipath effects, interference, which, in turn, impact
positioning accuracy. In addition, telemetry data differs depending on the WiFi
device vendor, offering distinct features and formats; use case requirements
can also vary widely. Currently, there is no unified model to handle all these
variations effectively. In this paper, we present WiFiGPT, a Generative
Pretrained Transformer (GPT) based system that is able to handle these
variations while achieving high localization accuracy. Our experiments with
WiFiGPT demonstrate that GPTs, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), can
effectively capture subtle spatial patterns in noisy wireless telemetry, making
them reliable regressors. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our
method matches and often surpasses conventional approaches for multiple types
of telemetry. Achieving sub-meter accuracy for RSSI and FTM and
centimeter-level precision for CSI demonstrates the potential of LLM-based
localisation to outperform specialized techniques, all without handcrafted
signal processing or calibration.

machine learning (ML). Deep learning models, in particular, have seen wide
application in mobile networking and communications to support advanced
services in emerging wireless environments, such as smart healthcare, smart
grids, autonomous vehicles, aerial platforms, digital twins, and the metaverse.
The rapid expansion of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, many with limited

concludes by outlining critical challenges and identifying future research
directions for the holistic integration of TinyML and LargeML in
next-generation wireless networks.

TL;DR: 论文展示了一种用于6G网络的大型AI模型，通过生成符合标准的RRC消息，实现了控制平面智能操作。

Motivation: 整合大型AI模型到6G移动网络，以实现自主、认知的网络操作，当前面临协议理解和实际部署的挑战。

Method: 使用LoRA微调解码器变换器模型（LLaMA类），将RRC消息线性化并保留ASN.1语法结构，以实现组合泛化。

Result: 在3万对实地测试中，模型的中位数余弦相似度达到0.97，比零样本基线提高了61%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，增强RAN特定推理的大型AI模型可直接协调控制平面操作，为AI原生无线标准奠定基础。

Abstract: Integrating large AI models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks promises to
redefine protocol design and control-plane intelligence by enabling autonomous,
cognitive network operations. While industry concepts, such as ETSI's
Experiential Networked Intelligence (ENI), envision LAM-driven agents for
adaptive network slicing and intent-based management, practical implementations
still face challenges in protocol literacy and real-world deployment. This
paper presents an end-to-end demonstration of a LAM that generates
standards-compliant, ASN.1-encoded Radio Resource Control (RRC) messages as
part of control-plane procedures inside a gNB. We treat RRC messaging as a
domain-specific language and fine-tune a decoder-only transformer model (LLaMA
class) using parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on RRC messages
linearized to retain their ASN.1 syntactic structure before standard byte-pair
encoding tokenization. This enables combinatorial generalization over RRC
protocol states while minimizing training overhead. On 30k field-test
request-response pairs, our 8 B model achieves a median cosine similarity of
0.97 with ground-truth messages on an edge GPU -- a 61 % relative gain over a
zero-shot LLaMA-3 8B baseline -- indicating substantially improved structural
and semantic RRC fidelity. Overall, our results show that LAMs, when augmented
with Radio Access Network (RAN)-specific reasoning, can directly orchestrate
control-plane procedures, representing a stepping stone toward the AI-native
air-interface paradigm. Beyond RRC emulation, this work lays the groundwork for
future AI-native wireless standards.

TL;DR: 利用FinBERT处理全球新闻情绪，结合XGBoost预测外汇和债券收益，Sharpe比率和CAGR表现优异。

Motivation: 研究旨在通过结合领域特定的NLP和可解释的机器学习方法，从全球新闻情绪中提取宏观经济Alpha。

Method: 使用FinBERT处理GDELT新闻数据构建情绪指标，驱动XGBoost分类器预测收益，并对比逻辑回归。

Result: XGBoost策略在OOS测试中获得优异表现，EUR/USD、USD/JPY和ZN的Sharpe比率分别达到5.87、4.65和4.65，CAGR超过50%（外汇）和22%（债券）。

Conclusion: 领域特定的NLP与可解释ML结合是提取宏观Alpha的有效方法。

Abstract: This study introduces an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to
extract macroeconomic alpha from global news sentiment. We process the Global
Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) Project's worldwide news feed
using FinBERT -- a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT) based model pretrained on finance-specific language -- to construct
daily sentiment indices incorporating mean tone, dispersion, and event impact.
These indices drive an XGBoost classifier, benchmarked against logistic
regression, to predict next-day returns for EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and 10-year U.S.
Treasury futures (ZN). Rigorous out-of-sample (OOS) backtesting (5-fold
expanding-window cross-validation, OOS period: c. 2017-April 2025) demonstrates
exceptional, cost-adjusted performance for the XGBoost strategy: Sharpe ratios
achieve 5.87 (EUR/USD), 4.65 (USD/JPY), and 4.65 (Treasuries), with respective
compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) exceeding 50% in Foreign Exchange (FX) and
22% in bonds. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) affirm that sentiment
dispersion and article impact are key predictive features. Our findings
establish that integrating domain-specific Natural Language Processing (NLP)
with interpretable ML offers a potent and explainable source of macro alpha.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究通过访谈分析了AI生成（AIG）内容标识的有效性，发现视觉和听觉提示存在不足，尤其是对盲人或弱视（BLV）用户。提出了改进标识设计的建议。

Motivation: 随着AI生成内容的普及，平台开始要求自我披露标识，但这些标识可能因依赖视觉提示而对某些用户无效。研究旨在探索标识的可用性问题。

Method: 通过半结构化访谈（N=28，包括15名视力正常者和13名BLV参与者），分析了用户如何通过自我披露的AI标识与AIG内容互动。

Result: 研究发现，视力正常者依赖视觉和听觉提示，而BLV用户主要依靠听觉和辅助工具，导致标识识别困难。两种用户均常忽略菜单辅助标识。

Conclusion: AIG标识的设计需改进，尤其是提升一致性和可访问性，以更好地服务于所有用户。

Abstract: AI-Generated (AIG) content has become increasingly widespread by recent
advances in generative models and the easy-to-use tools that have significantly
lowered the technical barriers for producing highly realistic audio, images,
and videos through simple natural language prompts. In response, platforms are
adopting provable provenance with platforms recommending AIG to be
self-disclosed and signaled to users. However, these indicators may be often
missed, especially when they rely solely on visual cues and make them
ineffective to users with different sensory abilities. To address the gap, we
conducted semi-structured interviews (N=28) with 15 sighted and 13 BLV
participants to examine their interaction with AIG content through
self-disclosed AI indicators. Our findings reveal diverse mental models and
practices, highlighting different strengths and weaknesses of content-based
(e.g., title, description) and menu-aided (e.g., AI labels) indicators. While
sighted participants leveraged visual and audio cues, BLV participants
primarily relied on audio and existing assistive tools, limiting their ability
to identify AIG. Across both groups, they frequently overlooked menu-aided
indicators deployed by platforms and rather interacted with content-based
indicators such as title and comments. We uncovered usability challenges
stemming from inconsistent indicator placement, unclear metadata, and cognitive
overload. These issues were especially critical for BLV individuals due to the
insufficient accessibility of interface elements. We provide practical
recommendations and design implications for future AIG indicators across
several dimensions.

TL;DR: 研究评估了一款结合智能手表传感器和机器学习算法的移动健康干预工具mHELP，用于实时压力检测和自我管理，发现其能显著减少大学生的急性压力，但对慢性症状（如抑郁）效果有限。

Motivation: 大学生普遍面临压力、焦虑和抑郁问题，但传统心理健康服务存在障碍，因此需要探索移动健康干预工具的潜力。

Method: 通过12周随机对照试验，将117名参与者分为干预组（使用mHELP完整功能）和对照组（仅用于压力记录和心理评估），使用GLMM分析主要和次要结果。

Result: 干预组在客观压力指标（MS）上显著下降，但主观焦虑（GAD-7）、抑郁（PHQ-8）和压力（PSS）评分无显著差异；干预组的GAD-7和PSS评分有临床意义下降。

Conclusion: 可穿戴设备支持的移动健康工具可减少大学生急性压力，但需更长期干预和个性化功能以应对慢性症状。

Abstract: College students are increasingly affected by stress, anxiety, and
depression, yet face barriers to traditional mental health care. This study
evaluated the efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, Mental Health
Evaluation and Lookout Program (mHELP), which integrates a smartwatch sensor
and machine learning (ML) algorithms for real-time stress detection and
self-management. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (n = 117),
participants were assigned to a treatment group using mHELP's full suite of
interventions or a control group using the app solely for real-time stress
logging and weekly psychological assessments. The primary outcome, "Moments of
Stress" (MS), was assessed via physiological and self-reported indicators and
analyzed using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) approaches. Similarly,
secondary outcomes of psychological assessments, including the Generalized
Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) for anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-8) for depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), were also
analyzed via GLMM. The finding of the objective measure, MS, indicates a
substantial decrease in MS among the treatment group compared to the control
group, while no notable between-group differences were observed in subjective
scores of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-8), or stress (PSS). However, the
treatment group exhibited a clinically meaningful decline in GAD-7 and PSS
scores. These findings underscore the potential of wearable-enabled mHealth
tools to reduce acute stress in college populations and highlight the need for
extended interventions and tailored features to address chronic symptoms like
depression.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VERDI是一种训练时框架，通过将视觉语言模型的推理过程与常识知识蒸馏到自动驾驶模块中，提升了决策性能，同时保持了高推理速度。

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在部分可观测性和复杂真实环境中的决策能力有限，而人类驾驶员能基于常识推理做出近优决策。现有方法虽在基准测试中表现良好，但部署时资源消耗大且安全性难以分解。VERDI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: VERDI通过在感知、预测和规划阶段将模块输出与视觉语言模型生成的文本特征对齐，使自动驾驶模型能够内化结构化推理过程，而无需在推理时使用大型视觉语言模型。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上，VERDI比未嵌入推理的端到端方法的ℓ2距离提升了10%，同时保持高推理速度。

Conclusion: VERDI成功地将视觉语言模型的推理能力整合到自动驾驶模块中，既提升了性能，又避免了大型模型的高成本。

Abstract: While autonomous driving (AD) stacks struggle with decision making under
partial observability and real-world complexity, human drivers are capable of
commonsense reasoning to make near-optimal decisions with limited information.
Recent work has attempted to leverage finetuned Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
for trajectory planning at inference time to emulate human behavior. Despite
their success in benchmark evaluations, these methods are often impractical to
deploy (a 70B parameter VLM inference at merely 8 tokens per second requires
more than 160G of memory), and their monolithic network structure prohibits
safety decomposition. To bridge this gap, we propose VLM-Embedded Reasoning for
autonomous Driving (VERDI), a training-time framework that distills the
reasoning process and commonsense knowledge of VLMs into the AD stack. VERDI
augments modular differentiable end-to-end (e2e) AD models by aligning
intermediate module outputs at the perception, prediction, and planning stages
with text features explaining the driving reasoning process produced by VLMs.
By encouraging alignment in latent space, \textsc{VERDI} enables the modular AD
stack to internalize structured reasoning, without incurring the inference-time
costs of large VLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the
NuScenes dataset and find that VERDI outperforms existing e2e methods that do
not embed reasoning by 10% in $\ell_{2}$ distance, while maintaining high
inference speed.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EasyInsert利用相对位姿（delta pose）和高效的真实世界数据收集，提出了一种用于通用插入任务的框架，具有强零样本泛化能力。

Motivation: 现有方法在复杂环境中泛化能力差，且依赖CAD模型或数字孪生等强假设。

Method: 基于人类直觉（相对位姿足够插入）和自动化数据收集，训练通用模型预测相对位姿，采用粗细执行策略。

Result: 仅需5小时训练数据，在15种新物体中13种达到90%零样本插入成功率；仅1次演示和4分钟微调数据，所有15种物体均达到90%成功率。

Conclusion: EasyInsert显著提升插入任务的泛化性和效率，减少人工干预。

Abstract: Insertion task is highly challenging that requires robots to operate with
exceptional precision in cluttered environments. Existing methods often have
poor generalization capabilities. They typically function in restricted and
structured environments, and frequently fail when the plug and socket are far
apart, when the scene is densely cluttered, or when handling novel objects.
They also rely on strong assumptions such as access to CAD models or a digital
twin in simulation. To address this, we propose EasyInsert, a framework which
leverages the human intuition that relative pose (delta pose) between plug and
socket is sufficient for successful insertion, and employs efficient and
automated real-world data collection with minimal human labor to train a
generalizable model for relative pose prediction. During execution, EasyInsert
follows a coarse-to-fine execution procedure based on predicted delta pose, and
successfully performs various insertion tasks. EasyInsert demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization capability for unseen objects in cluttered
environments, handling cases with significant initial pose deviations while
maintaining high sample efficiency and requiring little human effort. In
real-world experiments, with just 5 hours of training data, EasyInsert achieves
over 90% success in zero-shot insertion for 13 out of 15 unseen novel objects,
including challenging objects like Type-C cables, HDMI cables, and Ethernet
cables. Furthermore, with only one human demonstration and 4 minutes of
automatically collected data for fine-tuning, it reaches over 90% success rate
for all 15 objects.

Result: SEM显著提高了空间理解能力，在多样化任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: SEM通过互补的空间增强和机器人状态编码，实现了稳健且通用的机器人操作。

Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with
strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object
relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point
cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with
spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced
Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly
enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial
enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a
robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased
modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly
improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable
manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Manipulating elasto-plastic objects remains a significant challenge due to
severe self-occlusion, difficulties of representation, and complicated
dynamics. This work proposes a novel framework for elasto-plastic object
manipulation with a quasi-static assumption for motions, leveraging 3D
occupancy to represent such objects, a learned dynamics model trained with 3D
occupancy, and a learning-based predictive control algorithm to address these
challenges effectively. We build a novel data collection platform to collect
full spatial information and propose a pipeline for generating a 3D occupancy
dataset. To infer the 3D occupancy during manipulation, an occupancy prediction
network is trained with multiple RGB images supervised by the generated
dataset. We design a deep neural network empowered by a 3D convolution neural
network (CNN) and a graph neural network (GNN) to predict the complex
deformation with the inferred 3D occupancy results. A learning-based predictive
control algorithm is introduced to plan the robot actions, incorporating a
novel shape-based action initialization module specifically designed to improve
the planner efficiency. The proposed framework in this paper can successfully
shape the elasto-plastic objects into a given goal shape and has been verified
in various experiments both in simulation and the real world.

Conclusion: VL-SAFE首次引入视觉语言模型指导的世界模型方法，为自动驾驶提供了一种更安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based autonomous driving policy learning faces
critical limitations such as low sample efficiency and poor generalization; its
reliance on online interactions and trial-and-error learning is especially
unacceptable in safety-critical scenarios. Existing methods including safe RL
often fail to capture the true semantic meaning of "safety" in complex driving
contexts, leading to either overly conservative driving behavior or constraint
violations. To address these challenges, we propose VL-SAFE, a world
model-based safe RL framework with Vision-Language model
(VLM)-as-safety-guidance paradigm, designed for offline safe policy learning.
Specifically, we construct offline datasets containing data collected by expert
agents and labeled with safety scores derived from VLMs. A world model is
trained to generate imagined rollouts together with safety estimations,
allowing the agent to perform safe planning without interacting with the real
environment. Based on these imagined trajectories and safety evaluations,
actor-critic learning is conducted under VLM-based safety guidance to optimize
the driving policy more safely and efficiently. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VL-SAFE achieves superior sample efficiency, generalization,
safety, and overall performance compared to existing baselines. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces a VLM-guided world
model-based approach for safe autonomous driving. The demo video and code can

TL;DR: Raw2Drive是一个基于模型强化学习的双流方法，解决了自动驾驶中模仿学习的因果混淆和分布偏移问题，通过特权信息模型和原始传感器模型的协同训练实现了高效性能。

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中模仿学习的因果混淆和分布偏移问题，并将强化学习应用于端到端自动驾驶。

Result: 在CARLA Leaderboard 2.0和Bench2Drive上取得最优性能。

Conclusion: Raw2Drive是首个基于强化学习的端到端自动驾驶方法，性能优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) can mitigate the causal confusion and
distribution shift inherent to imitation learning (IL). However, applying RL to
end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training
difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and
industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated
promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require
privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap
by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently
train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that
uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor
world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures
consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model
during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior
knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively
guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL
based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Achieving full automation in self-driving vehicles remains a challenge,
especially in dynamic urban environments where navigation requires real-time
adaptability. Existing systems struggle to handle navigation plans when faced
with unpredictable changes in road layouts, spontaneous detours, or missing map
data, due to their heavy reliance on predefined cartographic information. In
this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models to generate Answer Set
Programming rules by translating informal navigation instructions into
structured, logic-based reasoning. ASP provides non-monotonic reasoning,
allowing autonomous vehicles to adapt to evolving scenarios without relying on
predefined maps. We present an experimental evaluation in which LLMs generate
ASP constraints that encode real-world urban driving logic into a formal
knowledge representation. By automating the translation of informal navigation
instructions into logical rules, our method improves adaptability and
explainability in autonomous navigation. Results show that LLM-driven ASP rule
generation supports semantic-based decision-making, offering an explainable
framework for dynamic navigation planning that aligns closely with how humans
communicate navigational intent.

Conclusion: 该框架为农业机器人提供了自主、感知驱动的解决方案，能够智能处理复杂植物环境中的遮挡问题。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework
for occlusion-aware robotic manipulation in cluttered plant environments. Our
approach enables a robot to interact with a deformable plant to reveal hidden
objects of interest, such as fruits, using multimodal observations. We decouple
the kinematic planning problem from robot control to simplify zero-shot
sim2real transfer for the trained policy. Our results demonstrate that the
trained policy, deployed using our framework, achieves up to 86.7% success in
real-world trials across diverse initial conditions. Our findings pave the way
toward autonomous, perception-driven agricultural robots that intelligently
interact with complex foliage plants to "find the fruit" in challenging
occluded scenarios, without the need for explicitly designed geometric and
dynamic models of every plant scenario.

Abstract: Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery is currently fully manually
controlled by a trained surgeon. Automating this has great potential for
alleviating issues, e.g., physical strain, highly repetitive tasks, and
shortages of trained surgeons. For these reasons, recent works have utilized
Artificial Intelligence methods, which show promising adaptability. Despite
these advances, there is skepticism of these methods because they lack
explainability and robust safety guarantees. This paper presents a framework
for a safe, uncertainty-aware learning method. We train an Ensemble Model of
Diffusion Policies using expert demonstrations of needle insertion. Using an
Ensemble model, we can quantify the policy's epistemic uncertainty, which is
used to determine Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. This allows the system to
release control back to the surgeon in the event of an unsafe scenario.
Additionally, we implement a model-free Control Barrier Function to place
formal safety guarantees on the predicted action. We experimentally evaluate
our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art robotic suturing simulator. We
evaluate multiple scenarios, such as dropping the needle, moving the camera,
and moving the phantom. The learned policy is robust to these perturbations,
showing corrective behaviors and generalization, and it is possible to detect
Out-Of-Distribution scenarios. We further demonstrate that the Control Barrier
Function successfully limits the action to remain within our specified safety
set in the case of unsafe predictions.

Conclusion: 方法在未见场景下表现出潜力，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how
rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these
simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and
temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years
all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a
physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities
as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the
numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the
predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next
time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our
model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations
(94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with
basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity.
Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also
show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network
architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and
loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach
on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.

TL;DR: 该论文通过理论分析提出了一种新的统计复杂度度量（CoT信息度量），证明了在链式思维监督下学习比标准监督具有更快的收敛速率。

Motivation: 解决标准监督学习中多步推理任务的挑战，通过链式思维监督（CoT）提供中间推理步骤，提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出CoT信息度量，将训练目标（CoT风险）与测试目标（端到端风险）明确关联，并通过理论推导样本复杂度界限。

Result: 证明CoT监督能显著降低样本复杂度，与标准监督相比，收敛速率更快。具体样本复杂度依赖CoT信息度量。

Conclusion: CoT信息是链式思维监督下学习的统计复杂度度量，为高效学习提供理论基础。

Abstract: Learning complex functions that involve multi-step reasoning poses a
significant challenge for standard supervised learning from input-output
examples. Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision, which provides intermediate
reasoning steps together with the final output, has emerged as a powerful
empirical technique, underpinning much of the recent progress in the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. This paper develops a statistical theory
of learning under CoT supervision. A key characteristic of the CoT setting, in
contrast to standard supervision, is the mismatch between the training
objective (CoT risk) and the test objective (end-to-end risk). A central part
of our analysis, distinguished from prior work, is explicitly linking those two
types of risk to achieve sharper sample complexity bounds. This is achieved via
the *CoT information measure* $\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, which quantifies the additional
discriminative power gained from observing the reasoning process. The main
theoretical results demonstrate how CoT supervision can yield significantly
faster learning rates compared to standard E2E supervision. Specifically, it is
shown that the sample complexity required to achieve a target E2E error
$\epsilon$ scales as $d/\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{D},
h_\star}^{\mathrm{CoT}}(\epsilon; \calH)$, where $d$ is a measure of hypothesis
class complexity, which can be much faster than standard $d/\epsilon$ rates.
Information-theoretic lower bounds in terms of the CoT information are also
obtained. Together, these results suggest that CoT information is a fundamental
measure of statistical complexity for learning under chain-of-thought
supervision.

Abstract: We propose PO-Flow, a novel continuous normalizing flow (CNF) framework for
causal inference that jointly models potential outcomes and counterfactuals.
Trained via flow matching, PO-Flow provides a unified framework for
individualized potential outcome prediction, counterfactual predictions, and
uncertainty-aware density learning. Among generative models, it is the first to
enable density learning of potential outcomes without requiring explicit
distributional assumptions (e.g., Gaussian mixtures), while also supporting
counterfactual prediction conditioned on factual outcomes in general
observational datasets. On benchmarks such as ACIC, IHDP, and IBM, it
consistently outperforms prior methods across a range of causal inference
tasks. Beyond that, PO-Flow succeeds in high-dimensional settings, including
counterfactual image generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架SnapMMD，用于预测潜在随机动态的观测时间之外的轨迹，尤其适用于单细胞mRNA分析中的数据不足情况。通过最大均值差异（MMD）损失直接拟合状态测量和观测时间的联合分布，该方法能够推断未知且状态相关的波动。

Motivation: 科学家需要从有限的“快照”数据中预测潜在随机动态的未来行为，但现有方法（如Schr\"odinger-bridge方法）在预测能力上存在不足，例如依赖预设参考动态或固定波动假设。因此，作者提出了一种更灵活的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SnapMMD框架，使用最大均值差异（MMD）损失直接拟合状态测量和观测时间的联合分布，无需预设动态或固定波动假设，从而能够推断状态相关的波动。

Conclusion: SnapMMD是一种高效且灵活的方法，能够从快照数据中学习和预测潜在动态，尤其适用于单细胞数据等复杂场景。

Abstract: Scientists often want to make predictions beyond the observed time horizon of
"snapshot" data following latent stochastic dynamics. For example, in time
course single-cell mRNA profiling, scientists have access to cellular
transcriptional state measurements (snapshots) from different biological
replicates at different time points, but they cannot access the trajectory of
any one cell because measurement destroys the cell. Researchers want to
forecast (e.g.) differentiation outcomes from early state measurements of stem
cells. Recent Schr\"odinger-bridge (SB) methods are natural for interpolating
between snapshots. But past SB papers have not addressed forecasting -- likely
since existing methods either (1) reduce to following pre-set reference
dynamics (chosen before seeing data) or (2) require the user to choose a fixed,
state-independent volatility since they minimize a Kullback-Leibler divergence.
Either case can lead to poor forecasting quality. In the present work, we
propose a new framework, SnapMMD, that learns dynamics by directly fitting the
joint distribution of both state measurements and observation time with a
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss. Unlike past work, our method allows us to
infer unknown and state-dependent volatilities from the observed data. We show
in a variety of real and synthetic experiments that our method delivers
accurate forecasts. Moreover, our approach allows us to learn in the presence
of incomplete state measurements and yields an $R^2$-style statistic that
diagnoses fit. We also find that our method's performance at interpolation (and
general velocity-field reconstruction) is at least as good as (and often better
than) state-of-the-art in almost all of our experiments.

Result: 结果表明，DANA能够通过调整动量超参数显著改善计算最优缩放行为，而传统方法未能实现。实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: DANA方法在广泛的复杂度范围内优于传统方法，为实践提供了更高效的优化算法。

Abstract: We investigate scaling laws for stochastic momentum algorithms with small
batch on the power law random features model, parameterized by data complexity,
target complexity, and model size. When trained with a stochastic momentum
algorithm, our analysis reveals four distinct loss curve shapes determined by
varying data-target complexities. While traditional stochastic gradient descent
with momentum (SGD-M) yields identical scaling law exponents to SGD,
dimension-adapted Nesterov acceleration (DANA) improves these exponents by
scaling momentum hyperparameters based on model size and data complexity. This
outscaling phenomenon, which also improves compute-optimal scaling behavior, is
achieved by DANA across a broad range of data and target complexities, while
traditional methods fall short. Extensive experiments on high-dimensional
synthetic quadratics validate our theoretical predictions and large-scale text
experiments with LSTMs show DANA's improved loss exponents over SGD hold in a
practical setting.

Motivation: 量化BPCA的不确定性是其相对于传统PCA的优势，但其CAVI算法的收敛速度尚未被研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过连接经典幂迭代算法，证明了单主成分模型的CAVI指数收敛性；引入新的下界工具证明任意主成分数模型的收敛性。

Result: 单主成分模型的CAVI指数收敛性得到证明，且传统PCA作为BPCA参数的点估计被回收；推广至任意主成分数模型的结果略有不同但更具普适性。

Conclusion: 论文不仅填补了BPCA中CAVI收敛速度的空白，还为信息理论提供了新的对称KL散度下界工具。

Abstract: Probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) and its Bayesian variant
(BPCA) are widely used for dimension reduction in machine learning and
statistics. The main advantage of probabilistic PCA over the traditional
formulation is allowing uncertainty quantification. The parameters of BPCA are
typically learned using mean-field variational inference, and in particular,
the coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) algorithm. So far, the
convergence speed of CAVI for BPCA has not been characterized. In our paper, we
fill this gap in the literature. Firstly, we prove a precise exponential
convergence result in the case where the model uses a single principal
component (PC). Interestingly, this result is established through a connection
with the classical $\textit{power iteration algorithm}$ and it indicates that
traditional PCA is retrieved as points estimates of the BPCA parameters.
Secondly, we leverage recent tools to prove exponential convergence of CAVI for
the model with any number of PCs, thus leading to a more general result, but
one that is of a slightly different flavor. To prove the latter result, we
additionally needed to introduce a novel lower bound for the symmetric
Kullback--Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions,
which, we believe, is of independent interest in information theory.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于Choquet积分的积分不精确概率度量（IIPM）框架，用于度量广义的不精确概率模型（如容量）之间的差异，并量化认知不确定性。

Motivation: 现有的概率度量方法难以处理认知不确定性（EU），而不精确概率（IP）理论提供了更丰富的模型。因此，需要一种新的度量框架来比较和量化IP模型中的不确定性。

Method: 提出了IIPM框架，扩展了经典的积分概率度量（IPM），适用于容量的广泛类。通过比较IP模型与其共轭模型，定义了新的认知不确定性度量——最大平均不精确度（MMI）。

Result: 理论证明IIPM在某些条件下是有效度量，并支持容量的弱收敛形式。实证实验中，MMI在选择性分类任务中表现出色，尤其在处理多类问题时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IIPM为不精确概率机器学习（IPML）提供了理论和实践支持，能够比较和量化认知不确定性，推动了IPML的发展。

Abstract: Quantifying differences between probability distributions is fundamental to
statistics and machine learning, primarily for comparing statistical
uncertainty. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (EU) -- due to incomplete
knowledge -- requires richer representations than those offered by classical
probability. Imprecise probability (IP) theory offers such models, capturing
ambiguity and partial belief. This has driven growing interest in imprecise
probabilistic machine learning (IPML), where inference and decision-making rely
on broader uncertainty models -- highlighting the need for metrics beyond
classical probability. This work introduces the Integral Imprecise Probability
Metric (IIPM) framework, a Choquet integral-based generalisation of classical
Integral Probability Metric (IPM) to the setting of capacities -- a broad class
of IP models encompassing many existing ones, including lower probabilities,
probability intervals, belief functions, and more. Theoretically, we establish
conditions under which IIPM serves as a valid metric and metrises a form of
weak convergence of capacities. Practically, IIPM not only enables comparison
across different IP models but also supports the quantification of epistemic
uncertainty within a single IP model. In particular, by comparing an IP model
with its conjugate, IIPM gives rise to a new class of EU measures -- Maximum
Mean Imprecision -- which satisfy key axiomatic properties proposed in the
Uncertainty Quantification literature. We validate MMI through selective
classification experiments, demonstrating strong empirical performance against
established EU measures, and outperforming them when classical methods struggle
to scale to a large number of classes. Our work advances both theory and
practice in IPML, offering a principled framework for comparing and quantifying
epistemic uncertainty under imprecision.

Result: 广义框架在数据适配性和几何解释上表现更优。

Conclusion: 广义功率后验为贝叶斯分析提供了更强的灵活性和理论支持。

Abstract: The power prior is a class of informative priors designed to incorporate
historical data alongside current data in a Bayesian framework. It includes a
power parameter that controls the influence of historical data, providing
flexibility and adaptability. A key property of the power prior is that the
resulting posterior minimizes a linear combination of KL divergences between
two pseudo-posterior distributions: one ignoring historical data and the other
fully incorporating it. We extend this framework by identifying the posterior
distribution as the minimizer of a linear combination of Amari's
$\alpha$-divergence, a generalization of KL divergence. We show that this
generalization can lead to improved performance by allowing for the data to
adapt to appropriate choices of the $\alpha$ parameter. Theoretical properties
of this generalized power posterior are established, including behavior as a
generalized geodesic on the Riemannian manifold of probability distributions,
offering novel insights into its geometric interpretation.

Motivation: 传统黑盒偏移估计器依赖经验混淆矩阵的逆，忽略了采样噪声和类别间相似性，导致结果脆弱且不准确。本文旨在提出一种更鲁棒的概率方法。

Method: GS-B³SE在目标对数先验和混淆矩阵列上引入拉普拉斯-高斯先验，并通过标签相似性图将两者关联，后验分布可通过HMC或快速牛顿-CG方案求解。

Conclusion: GS-B³SE不仅提升了估计器的鲁棒性和准确性，还在信息几何学框架下推广了现有偏移估计器。

Abstract: Label shift adaptation aims to recover target class priors when the labelled
source distribution $P$ and the unlabelled target distribution $Q$ share $P(X
\mid Y) = Q(X \mid Y)$ but $P(Y) \neq Q(Y)$. Classical black-box shift
estimators invert an empirical confusion matrix of a frozen classifier,
producing a brittle point estimate that ignores sampling noise and similarity
among classes. We present Graph-Smoothed Bayesian BBSE (GS-B$^3$SE), a fully
probabilistic alternative that places Laplacian-Gaussian priors on both target
log-priors and confusion-matrix columns, tying them together on a
label-similarity graph. The resulting posterior is tractable with HMC or a fast
block Newton-CG scheme. We prove identifiability, $N^{-1/2}$ contraction,
variance bounds that shrink with the graph's algebraic connectivity, and
robustness to Laplacian misspecification. We also reinterpret GS-B$^3$SE
through information geometry, showing that it generalizes existing shift
estimators.

Abstract: This study develops a higher-order asymptotic framework for test-time
adaptation (TTA) of Batch Normalization (BN) statistics under distribution
shift by integrating classical Edgeworth expansion and saddlepoint
approximation techniques with a novel one-step M-estimation perspective. By
analyzing the statistical discrepancy between training and test distributions,
we derive an Edgeworth expansion for the normalized difference in BN means and
obtain an optimal weighting parameter that minimizes the mean-squared error of
the adapted statistic. Reinterpreting BN TTA as a one-step M-estimator allows
us to derive higher-order local asymptotic normality results, which incorporate
skewness and other higher moments into the estimator's behavior. Moreover, we
quantify the trade-offs among bias, variance, and skewness in the adaptation
process and establish a corresponding generalization bound on the model risk.
The refined saddlepoint approximations further deliver uniformly accurate
density and tail probability estimates for the BN TTA statistic. These
theoretical insights provide a comprehensive understanding of how higher-order
corrections and robust one-step updating can enhance the reliability and
performance of BN layers in adapting to changing data distributions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models have
enabled the generation of personalized content that adapts to up-to-date user
context. While personalized decision systems are often modeled using bandit
formulations, the integration of GenAI introduces new structure into otherwise
classical sequential learning problems. In GenAI-powered interventions, the
agent selects a query, but the environment experiences a stochastic response
drawn from the generative model. Standard bandit methods do not explicitly
account for this structure, where actions influence rewards only through
stochastic, observed treatments. We introduce generator-mediated
bandit-Thompson sampling (GAMBITTS), a bandit approach designed for this
action/treatment split, using mobile health interventions with large language
model-generated text as a motivating case study. GAMBITTS explicitly models
both the treatment and reward generation processes, using information in the
delivered treatment to accelerate policy learning relative to standard methods.
We establish regret bounds for GAMBITTS by decomposing sources of uncertainty
in treatment and reward, identifying conditions where it achieves stronger
guarantees than standard bandit approaches. In simulation studies, GAMBITTS
consistently outperforms conventional algorithms by leveraging observed
treatments to more accurately estimate expected rewards.

Result: 研究发现，在数据为各向同性的情况下，DP-SGD的风险界限可由ODE的上下界精确描述，进一步证明了激进裁剪的最优性，并提出学习率衰减和噪声调度的优势。

Conclusion: 通过ODE分析，论文证明了在特定数据条件下，DP-SGD的激进裁剪策略具有最优性，学习率衰减和噪声调度能进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) linear regression has received significant
attention in the recent theoretical literature, with several works aimed at
obtaining improved error rates. A common approach is to set the clipping
constant much larger than the expected norm of the per-sample gradients. While
simplifying the analysis, this is however in sharp contrast with what empirical
evidence suggests to optimize performance. Our work bridges this gap between
theory and practice: we provide sharper rates for DP stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD) by crucially operating in a regime where clipping happens
frequently. Specifically, we consider the setting where the data is
multivariate Gaussian, the number of training samples $n$ is proportional to
the input dimension $d$, and the algorithm guarantees constant-order zero
concentrated DP. Our method relies on establishing a deterministic equivalent
for the trajectory of DP-SGD in terms of a family of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). As a consequence, the risk of DP-SGD is bounded between two
ODEs, with upper and lower bounds matching for isotropic data. By studying
these ODEs when $n / d$ is large enough, we demonstrate the optimality of
aggressive clipping, and we uncover the benefits of decaying learning rate and
private noise scheduling.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了薛定谔桥问题，提出了一种针对非平衡系统的多变量Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程的新方法，并开发了高效算法mvOU-OTFM，在合成和真实单细胞数据上表现优异。

Motivation: 现有文献主要假设布朗运动作为参考动力学，局限于势驱动系统，而生物系统通常处于非平衡状态，需要解决非保守力问题。

Method: 采用多变量Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程作为参考，推导了高斯边际下的显式解，并提出了无模拟算法mvOU-OTFM，基于流和分数匹配。

Result: mvOU-OTFM在合成和真实数据上表现优于其他方法，训练速度显著更快。

Conclusion: 新方法为非平衡系统的薛定谔桥问题提供了高效解决方案，尤其是在生物系统应用中表现出色。

Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger bridge problem which, given ensemble
measurements of the initial and final configurations of a stochastic dynamical
system and some prior knowledge on the dynamics, aims to reconstruct the "most
likely" evolution of the system compatible with the data. Most existing
literature assume Brownian reference dynamics and are implicitly limited to
potential-driven dynamics. We depart from this regime and consider reference
processes described by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with generic
drift matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$. When $\mathbf{A}$ is
asymmetric, this corresponds to a non-equilibrium system with non-conservative
forces at play: this is important for applications to biological systems, which
are naturally exist out-of-equilibrium. In the case of Gaussian marginals, we
derive explicit expressions that characterise the solution of both the static
and dynamic Schr\"odinger bridge. For general marginals, we propose mvOU-OTFM,
a simulation-free algorithm based on flow and score matching for learning the
Schr\"odinger bridge. In application to a range of problems based on synthetic
and real single cell data, we demonstrate that mvOU-OTFM achieves higher
accuracy compared to competing methods, whilst being significantly faster to
train.

TL;DR: 论文通过等周论证研究了二元线性分类中均匀泛化误差的集中现象，建立了输出标签和标签加权输入向量的联合分布的Poincaré和对数Sobolev不等式，并推导出集中界。

Motivation: 研究二元线性分类问题中均匀泛化误差的集中性，特别是在高维比例设置下的几乎必然收敛行为。

Method: 使用等周论证，建立联合分布的Poincaré和对数Sobolev不等式，并推导集中界。

Result: 推导出的集中界在适度乘性常数内是尖锐的；在渐近分析中，证明了均匀泛化误差在非常广泛的设置（如高维比例）下几乎必然收敛于期望。

Conclusion: 研究通过集中界和收敛性分析，为均匀大数定律在无维度条件下的成立提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We examine the concentration of uniform generalization errors around their
expectation in binary linear classification problems via an isoperimetric
argument. In particular, we establish Poincar\'{e} and log-Sobolev inequalities
for the joint distribution of the output labels and the label-weighted input
vectors, which we apply to derive concentration bounds. The derived
concentration bounds are sharp up to moderate multiplicative constants by those
under well-balanced labels. In asymptotic analysis, we also show that almost
sure convergence of uniform generalization errors to their expectation occurs
in very broad settings, such as proportionally high-dimensional regimes. Using
this convergence, we establish uniform laws of large numbers under
dimension-free conditions.

Conclusion: 结论表明，广义Hanson-Wright不等式能够有效地揭示数据点云的几何特性，且为网格细胞活动的几何忠实性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We present a generalised Hanson-Wright inequality and use it to establish new
statistical insights into the geometry of data point-clouds. In the setting of
a general random function model of data, we clarify the roles played by three
notions of dimensionality: ambient intrinsic dimension $p_{\mathrm{int}}$,
which measures total variability across orthogonal feature directions;
correlation rank, which measures functional complexity across samples; and
latent intrinsic dimension, which is the dimension of manifold structure hidden
in data. Our analysis shows that in order for persistence diagrams to reveal
latent homology and for manifold structure to emerge it is sufficient that
$p_{\mathrm{int}}\gg \log n$, where $n$ is the sample size. Informed by these
theoretical perspectives, we revisit the ground-breaking neuroscience discovery
of toroidal structure in grid-cell activity made by Gardner et al. (Nature,
2022): our findings reveal, for the first time, evidence that this structure is
in fact isometric to physical space, meaning that grid cell activity conveys a
geometrically faithful representation of the real world.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，确保显著性子图包含有意义的信息。

Conclusion: 该方法能可靠评估GNN显著性图，避免随机伪影的影响。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence for their ability to
process graph-structured data across various domains. However, interpreting GNN
decisions remains a significant challenge, leading to the adoption of saliency
maps for identifying influential nodes and edges. Despite their utility, the
reliability of GNN saliency maps has been questioned, particularly in terms of
their robustness to noise. In this study, we propose a statistical testing
framework to rigorously evaluate the significance of saliency maps. Our main
contribution lies in addressing the inflation of the Type I error rate caused
by double-dipping of data, leveraging the framework of Selective Inference. Our
method provides statistically valid $p$-values while controlling the Type I
error rate, ensuring that identified salient subgraphs contain meaningful
information rather than random artifacts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
showing its effectiveness in assessing the reliability of GNN interpretations.

Abstract: A reliable uncertainty estimation method is the foundation of many modern
out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, which are critical for safe deployments of
deep learning models in the open world. In this work, we propose TULiP, a
theoretically-driven post-hoc uncertainty estimator for OOD detection. Our
approach considers a hypothetical perturbation applied to the network before
convergence. Based on linearized training dynamics, we bound the effect of such
perturbation, resulting in an uncertainty score computable by perturbing model
parameters. Ultimately, our approach computes uncertainty from a set of sampled
predictions. We visualize our bound on synthetic regression and classification
datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TULiP using
large-scale OOD detection benchmarks for image classification. Our method
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, particularly for near-distribution
samples.

Method: 在适当正则条件下，推导了固定指标和超过阈值的临界点数量的渐近公式，分析了三种不同增长模式。

Result: 理论预测显示了三种增长模式（收敛、多项式增长、指数增长），数值实验支持了这些预测。对于不满足正则条件的情况（如ReLU激活），临界点数量可能发散。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络的临界点数量随深度的不同增长模式，并指出了ReLU激活可能导致临界点数量发散的现象。

Abstract: This work investigates the expected number of critical points of random
neural networks with different activation functions as the depth increases in
the infinite-width limit. Under suitable regularity conditions, we derive
precise asymptotic formulas for the expected number of critical points of fixed
index and those exceeding a given threshold. Our analysis reveals three
distinct regimes depending on the value of the first derivative of the
covariance evaluated at 1: the expected number of critical points may converge,
grow polynomially, or grow exponentially with depth. The theoretical
predictions are supported by numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide
numerical evidence suggesting that, when the regularity condition is not
satisfied (e.g. for neural networks with ReLU as activation function), the
number of critical points increases as the map resolution increases, indicating
a potential divergence in the number of critical points.

Abstract: In this paper, we apply both supervised and unsupervised machine learning
algorithms to the study of the string landscape and swampland in 6-dimensions.
Our data are the (almost) anomaly-free 6-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = (1,0)$
supergravity models, characterised by the Gram matrix of anomaly coefficients.
Our work demonstrates the ability of machine learning algorithms to efficiently
learn highly complex features of the landscape and swampland. Employing an
autoencoder for unsupervised learning, we provide an auto-classification of
these models by compressing the Gram matrix data to 2-dimensions. Through
compression, similar models cluster together, and we identify prominent
features of these clusters. The autoencoder also identifies outlier models
which are difficult to reconstruct. One of these outliers proves to be
incredibly difficult to combine with other models such that the
$\text{tr}R^{4}$ anomaly vanishes, making its presence in the landscape
extremely rare. Further, we utilise supervised learning to build two
classifiers predicting (1) model consistency under probe string insertion
(precision: 0.78, predicting consistency for 214,837 models with reasonable
certainty) and (2) inconsistency under anomaly inflow (precision: 0.91,
predicting inconsistency for 1,909,359 models). Notably, projecting these
predictions onto the autoencoder's 2-dimensional latent layer shows consistent
models clustering together, further indicating that the autoencoder has learnt
interesting and complex features of the set of models and potentially offers a
novel approach to mapping the landscape and swampland of 6-dimensional
supergravity theories.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了ReLU神经网络表达能力的复杂性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: An established measure of the expressive power of a given ReLU neural network
is the number of linear regions into which it partitions the input space. There
exist many different, non-equivalent definitions of what a linear region
actually is. We systematically assess which papers use which definitions and
discuss how they relate to each other. We then analyze the computational
complexity of counting the number of such regions for the various definitions.
Generally, this turns out to be an intractable problem. We prove NP- and
#P-hardness results already for networks with one hidden layer and strong
hardness of approximation results for two or more hidden layers. Finally, on
the algorithmic side, we demonstrate that counting linear regions can at least
be achieved in polynomial space for some common definitions.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) with physical systems requires an understanding of
the underlying structure and internal dynamics of the specific physical
reservoir. In this study, physical nano-electronic networks with neuromorphic
dynamics are investigated for their use as physical reservoirs in an RC
framework. These neuromorphic networks operate as dynamic reservoirs, with node
activities in general coupled to the edge dynamics through nonlinear
nano-electronic circuit elements, and the reservoir outputs influenced by the
underlying network connectivity structure. This study finds that networks with
varying degrees of sparsity generate more useful nonlinear temporal outputs for
dynamic RC compared to dense networks. Dynamic RC is also tested on an
autonomous multivariate chaotic time series prediction task with networks of
varying densities, which revealed the importance of network sparsity in
maintaining network activity and overall dynamics, that in turn enabled the
learning of the chaotic Lorenz63 system's attractor behavior.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Language Models (LMs) across industries is driving
interest in deploying these services across the computing continuum, from the

advances in model compression, are central to this shift, offering a path to
on-device inference on resource-constrained edge platforms. This work examines
the interplay between edge and cloud deployments, starting from detailed
benchmarking of SLM capabilities on single edge devices, and extending to
distributed edge clusters. We identify scenarios where edge inference offers
comparable performance with lower costs, and others where cloud fallback
becomes essential due to limits in scalability or model capacity. Rather than
proposing a one-size-fits-all solution, we present platform-level comparisons

Result: 自动化生成的ZC指标在13个NAS问题上表现优于手动设计指标，且能在15分钟内用单GPU找到高性能网络架构。

Conclusion: 自动化设计ZC指标可行且高效，显著提升NAS效率。

Abstract: Estimating the network performance using zero-cost (ZC) metrics has proven
both its efficiency and efficacy in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However,
a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by
the substantial variation in their performance across different problems.
Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a
time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain
expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate
the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC
metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a
framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the
design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also
capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank
correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and
tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero
demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform
hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search
objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures
with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to drive innovation in complex,
decentralized environments, the need for scalable, adaptive, and

introduces a novel framework combining quantum-inspired neural networks with
evolutionary algorithms to optimize real-time decision-making in multi-agent
systems (MAS). The proposed Quantum-Evolutionary Neural Network (QE-NN)
leverages quantum computing principles -- such as quantum superposition and
entanglement -- to enhance learning speed and decision accuracy, while
integrating evolutionary optimization to continually refine agent behaviors in
dynamic, uncertain environments. By utilizing federated learning, QE-NN ensures
privacy preservation, enabling decentralized agents to collaborate without
sharing sensitive data. The framework is designed to allow agents to adapt in
real-time to their environments, optimizing decision-making processes for
applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and healthcare.
This research represents a breakthrough in merging quantum computing,
evolutionary optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques to solve complex
problems in multi-agent decision-making systems, pushing the boundaries of AI

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现显著提升，ImageNet上达到86.83%的准确率，为当前最优。

Conclusion: 反馈结构有效提升SNNs性能，证明了时间信息整合和梯度传播优化的双重作用。

Abstract: Traditional spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be viewed as a combination of
multiple subnetworks with each running for one time step, where the parameters
are shared, and the membrane potential serves as the only information link
between them. However, the implicit nature of the membrane potential limits its
ability to effectively represent temporal information. As a result, each time
step cannot fully leverage information from previous time steps, seriously
limiting the model's performance. Inspired by the top-down mechanism in the
brain, we introduce TDFormer, a novel model with a top-down feedback structure
that functions hierarchically and leverages high-order representations from
earlier time steps to modulate the processing of low-order information at later
stages. The feedback structure plays a role from two perspectives: 1) During
forward propagation, our model increases the mutual information across time
steps, indicating that richer temporal information is being transmitted and
integrated in different time steps. 2) During backward propagation, we
theoretically prove that the feedback structure alleviates the problem of
vanishing gradients along the time dimension. We find that these mechanisms
together significantly and consistently improve the model performance on
multiple datasets. In particular, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on ImageNet with an accuracy of 86.83%.

Abstract: Deployment of deep neural networks in resource-constrained embedded systems
requires innovative algorithmic solutions to facilitate their energy and memory
efficiency. To further ensure the reliability of these systems against
malicious actors, recent works have extensively studied adversarial robustness
of existing architectures. Our work focuses on the intersection of adversarial
robustness, memory- and energy-efficiency in neural networks. We introduce a
neural network conversion algorithm designed to produce sparse and
adversarially robust spiking neural networks (SNNs) by leveraging the sparse
connectivity and weights from a robustly pretrained artificial neural network
(ANN). Our approach combines the energy-efficient architecture of SNNs with a
novel conversion algorithm, leading to state-of-the-art performance with
enhanced energy and memory efficiency through sparse connectivity and
activations. Our models are shown to achieve up to 100x reduction in the number
of weights to be stored in memory, with an estimated 8.6x increase in energy
efficiency compared to dense SNNs, while maintaining high performance and
robustness against adversarial threats.

Abstract: Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is
a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently,
data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically
learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to
unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform
well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen
test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to
learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale
VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances
during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing
studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this,
we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL)
into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce
training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually
increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for
large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of
CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three
baseline methods.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NC) introduces a novel algorithmic paradigm
representing a major shift from traditional digital computing of Von Neumann
architectures. NC emulates or simulates the neural dynamics of brains in the
form of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Much of the research in NC has
concentrated on machine learning applications and neuroscience simulations.
This paper investigates the modelling and implementation of optimization
algorithms and particularly metaheuristics using the NC paradigm as an
alternative to Von Neumann architectures, leading to breakthroughs in solving
optimization problems.
  Neuromorphic-based metaheuristics (Nheuristics) are supposed to be
characterized by low power, low latency and small footprint. Since NC systems
are fundamentally different from conventional Von Neumann computers, several
challenges are posed to the design and implementation of Nheuristics. A
guideline based on a classification and critical analysis is conducted on the
different families of metaheuristics and optimization problems they address. We
also discuss future directions that need to be addressed to expand both the
development and application of Nheuristics.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used for dynamic algorithm
configuration, particularly in evolutionary computation, which benefits from
the adaptive update of parameters during the algorithmic execution. However,
applying DRL to algorithm configuration for multi-objective combinatorial

a novel graph neural network (GNN) based DRL to configure multi-objective

Markov decision process, representing the convergence of solutions in the
objective space by a graph, with their embeddings learned by a GNN to enhance
the state representation. Experiments on diverse MOCO challenges indicate that
our method outperforms traditional and DRL-based algorithm configuration
methods in terms of efficacy and adaptability. It also exhibits advantageous
generalizability across objective types and problem sizes, and applicability to
different evolutionary computation methods.

Abstract: Quantum optimization is the most mature quantum computing technology to date,
providing a promising approach towards efficiently solving complex
combinatorial problems. Methods such as adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) have
been employed in recent years on important optimization problems across various
domains. In deep learning, deep neural networks (DNN) have reached immense
sizes to support new predictive capabilities. Optimization of large-scale
models is critical for sustainable deployment, but becomes increasingly
challenging with ever-growing model sizes and complexity. While quantum
optimization is suitable for solving complex problems, its application to DNN
optimization is not straightforward, requiring thorough reformulation for
compatibility with commercially available quantum devices. In this work, we
explore the potential of adopting AQC for fine-grained pruning-quantization of
convolutional neural networks. We rework established heuristics to formulate
model compression as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
problem, and assess the solution space offered by commercial quantum annealing
devices. Through our exploratory efforts of reformulation, we demonstrate that
AQC can achieve effective compression of practical DNN models. Experiments
demonstrate that adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) not only outperforms
classical algorithms like genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning in
terms of time efficiency but also excels at identifying global optima.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models, like their classical counterparts, are
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, hindering their secure deployment. Here, we

algorithm designed for QNNs, enabling quantitative characterization of
adversarial robustness and robustness bounds. From our analysis, we verify that
adversarial training reduces sensitivity to targeted perturbations by
regularizing input gradients, significantly enhancing QNN's robustness.
Additionally, our analysis reveals that QNNs exhibit superior adversarial
robustness compared to classical neural networks, an advantage attributed to
inherent quantum noise. Furthermore, the empirical upper bound extracted from
our attack experiments shows a minimal deviation ($3 \times 10^{-3}$) from the
theoretical lower bound, providing strong experimental confirmation of the
attack's effectiveness and the tightness of fidelity-based robustness bounds.
This work establishes a critical experimental framework for assessing and
improving quantum adversarial robustness, paving the way for secure and

TL;DR: DuFFin是一种新型的黑盒所有权验证框架，通过双重指纹提取有效保护大语言模型的IP。

Motivation: 由于大语言模型的训练成本高昂，保护其知识产权（IP）免受恶意窃取或未经授权的部署变得至关重要。现有水印和指纹方法不实用，因此需要新方法。

Method: DuFFin框架通过提取触发器模式（trigger pattern）和知识级指纹（knowledge-level fingerprints），在无需白盒访问的情况下验证模型所有权。

Result: 实验表明，DuFFin能准确验证基础模型及其变体的版权，IP-ROC指标大于0.95。

Conclusion: DuFFin为黑盒环境下的大语言模型IP保护提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are considered valuable Intellectual Properties
(IP) for legitimate owners due to the enormous computational cost of training.
It is crucial to protect the IP of LLMs from malicious stealing or unauthorized
deployment. Despite existing efforts in watermarking and fingerprinting LLMs,
these methods either impact the text generation process or are limited in
white-box access to the suspect model, making them impractical. Hence, we
propose DuFFin, a novel $\textbf{Du}$al-Level $\textbf{Fin}$gerprinting
$\textbf{F}$ramework for black-box setting ownership verification. DuFFin
extracts the trigger pattern and the knowledge-level fingerprints to identify
the source of a suspect model. We conduct experiments on a variety of models
collected from the open-source website, including four popular base models as
protected LLMs and their fine-tuning, quantization, and safety alignment
versions, which are released by large companies, start-ups, and individual
users. Results show that our method can accurately verify the copyright of the
base protected LLM on their model variants, achieving the IP-ROC metric greater
than 0.95. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法CTRAP，通过诱导模型崩溃来防御有害的微调攻击，解决了选择性遗忘的局限性。

Motivation: 现有的选择性遗忘方法无法彻底阻止大语言模型（LLM）被恶意利用，论文旨在解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出了Collapse Trap（CTRAP），通过在模型中对齐期间预配置条件反应机制，当检测到恶意微调时触发模型崩溃。

Result: 实验证明CTRAP能有效抵御有害微调攻击，同时在正常场景中保持高性能。

Conclusion: CTRAP提供了一种更彻底的防御机制，优于选择性遗忘方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning-as-a-service, while commercially successful for Large Language
Model (LLM) providers, exposes models to harmful fine-tuning attacks. As a
widely explored defense paradigm against such attacks, unlearning attempts to
remove malicious knowledge from LLMs, thereby essentially preventing them from
being used to perform malicious tasks. However, we highlight a critical flaw:
the powerful general adaptability of LLMs allows them to easily bypass
selective unlearning by rapidly relearning or repurposing their capabilities
for harmful tasks. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a
paradigm shift: instead of selective removal, we advocate for inducing model
collapse--effectively forcing the model to "unlearn everything"--specifically
in response to updates characteristic of malicious adaptation. This collapse
directly neutralizes the very general capabilities that attackers exploit,
tackling the core issue unaddressed by selective unlearning. We introduce the
Collapse Trap (CTRAP) as a practical mechanism to implement this concept
conditionally. Embedded during alignment, CTRAP pre-configures the model's
reaction to subsequent fine-tuning dynamics. If updates during fine-tuning
constitute a persistent attempt to reverse safety alignment, the pre-configured
trap triggers a progressive degradation of the model's core language modeling
abilities, ultimately rendering it inert and useless for the attacker.
Crucially, this collapse mechanism remains dormant during benign fine-tuning,
ensuring the model's utility and general capabilities are preserved for
legitimate users. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that CTRAP
effectively counters harmful fine-tuning risks across various LLMs and attack
settings, while maintaining high performance in benign scenarios. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CTRAP.

Conclusion: 分层分类框架能有效平衡边缘节点的资源限制与检测需求，提升车联网安全。

Abstract: Due to its nature of dynamic, mobility, and wireless data transfer, the
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is prone to various cyber threats, ranging from
spoofing and Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) attacks to malware. To
safeguard the IoV ecosystem from intrusions, malicious activities, policy
violations, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a critical role by
continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic to identify and mitigate
potential threats in real-time. However, most existing research has focused on
developing centralized, machine learning-based IDS systems for IoV without
accounting for its inherently distributed nature. Due to intensive computing
requirements, these centralized systems often rely on the cloud to detect cyber
threats, increasing delay of system response. On the other hand, edge nodes
typically lack the necessary resources to train and deploy complex machine
learning algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes an effective
hierarchical classification framework tailored for IoV networks. Hierarchical
classification allows classifiers to be trained and tested at different levels,
enabling edge nodes to detect specific types of attacks independently. With
this approach, edge nodes can conduct targeted attack detection while
leveraging cloud nodes for comprehensive threat analysis and support. Given the
resource constraints of edge nodes, we have employed the Boruta feature
selection method to reduce data dimensionality, optimizing processing
efficiency. To evaluate our proposed framework, we utilize the latest IoV
security dataset CIC-IoV2024, achieving promising results that demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of our models in securing IoV networks.

Conclusion: 该研究强调了增强LLMs鲁棒性的重要性，以确保其在实际应用中的安全性和完整性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many applications, but are also
known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce a
novel security threat: hijacking AI-human conversations by manipulating LLMs'
system prompts to produce malicious answers only to specific targeted questions
(e.g., "Who should I vote for US President?", "Are Covid vaccines safe?"),
while behaving benignly on others. This attack is detrimental as it can enable
malicious actors to exercise large-scale information manipulation by spreading
harmful but benign-looking system prompts online. To demonstrate such an
attack, we develop CAIN, an algorithm that can automatically curate such
harmful system prompts for a specific target question in a black-box setting or
without the need to access the LLM's parameters. Evaluated on both open-source
and commercial LLMs, CAIN demonstrates significant adversarial impact. In
untargeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output incorrect answers, CAIN achieves
up to 40% F1 degradation on targeted questions while preserving high accuracy
on benign inputs. For targeted attacks or forcing LLMs to output specific
harmful answers, CAIN achieves over 70% F1 scores on these targeted responses
with minimal impact on benign questions. Our results highlight the critical
need for enhanced robustness measures to safeguard the integrity and safety of
LLMs in real-world applications. All source code will be publicly available.

Motivation: 传统对抗扰动攻击的局限性促使研究者探索更隐蔽的后门攻击方法，特别是在VLA模型中的应用尚未被充分研究。

Method: 提出基于目标解耦优化的BadVLA方法，包含特征空间分离和条件控制偏差两个阶段，以激活后门触发。

Result: BadVLA在多VLA基准测试中取得接近100%的攻击成功率，而对正常任务性能影响极小，且对抗常见干扰表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究表明VLA模型存在严重后门安全漏洞，亟需改进模型设计以提升安全性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic control by enabling
end-to-end decision-making directly from multimodal inputs. However, their
tightly coupled architectures expose novel security vulnerabilities. Unlike
traditional adversarial perturbations, backdoor attacks represent a stealthier,
persistent, and practically significant threat-particularly under the emerging
Training-as-a-Service paradigm-but remain largely unexplored in the context of
VLA models. To address this gap, we propose BadVLA, a backdoor attack method
based on Objective-Decoupled Optimization, which for the first time exposes the
backdoor vulnerabilities of VLA models. Specifically, it consists of a
two-stage process: (1) explicit feature-space separation to isolate trigger
representations from benign inputs, and (2) conditional control deviations that
activate only in the presence of the trigger, while preserving clean-task
performance. Empirical results on multiple VLA benchmarks demonstrate that
BadVLA consistently achieves near-100% attack success rates with minimal impact
on clean task accuracy. Further analyses confirm its robustness against common
input perturbations, task transfers, and model fine-tuning, underscoring
critical security vulnerabilities in current VLA deployments. Our work offers
the first systematic investigation of backdoor vulnerabilities in VLA models,
highlighting an urgent need for secure and trustworthy embodied model design
practices. We have released the project page at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型的推理成本攻击（BitHydra），通过翻转模型参数中的关键比特，显著提高了攻击效率，能够在极少样本和比特翻转下实现最大化输出长度的攻击效果。

Motivation: 现有推理成本攻击因自目标性而难以大规模生效，故研究攻击模型本身而非输入的更高效方法。

Method: 设计了BitHydra方法，通过抑制<EOS>标记概率的损失函数和高效关键比特搜索算法，翻转模型关键比特。

Result: 在11种LLMs上验证，仅需4样本和3比特翻转即可使100%测试提示达到最大生成长度（如2048标记）。

Conclusion: BitHydra具有高效性、可扩展性和强迁移性，显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide
range of applications, but their ever-increasing size and resource demands make
them vulnerable to inference cost attacks, where attackers induce victim LLMs
to generate the longest possible output content. In this paper, we revisit
existing inference cost attacks and reveal that these methods can hardly
produce large-scale malicious effects since they are self-targeting, where
attackers are also the users and therefore have to execute attacks solely
through the inputs, whose generated content will be charged by LLMs and can
only directly influence themselves. Motivated by these findings, this paper
introduces a new type of inference cost attacks (dubbed 'bit-flip inference
cost attack') that target the victim model itself rather than its inputs.
Specifically, we design a simple yet effective method (dubbed 'BitHydra') to
effectively flip critical bits of model parameters. This process is guided by a
loss function designed to suppress <EOS> token's probability with an efficient
critical bit search algorithm, thus explicitly defining the attack objective
and enabling effective optimization. We evaluate our method on 11 LLMs ranging
from 1.5B to 14B parameters under both int8 and float16 settings. Experimental
results demonstrate that with just 4 search samples and as few as 3 bit flips,
BitHydra can force 100% of test prompts to reach the maximum generation length
(e.g., 2048 tokens) on representative LLMs such as LLaMA3, highlighting its
efficiency, scalability, and strong transferability across unseen inputs.

Conclusion: 领域特定水印是一种有效的模型指纹技术，具有隐蔽性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As open-source language models (OSMs) grow more capable and are widely shared
and finetuned, ensuring model provenance, i.e., identifying the origin of a
given model instance, has become an increasingly important issue. At the same
time, existing backdoor-based model fingerprinting techniques often fall short
of achieving key requirements of real-world model ownership detection. In this
work, we build on the observation that while current open-source model
watermarks fail to achieve reliable content traceability, they can be
effectively adapted to address the challenge of model provenance. To this end,
we introduce the concept of domain-specific watermarking for model
fingerprinting. Rather than watermarking all generated content, we train the
model to embed watermarks only within specified subdomains (e.g., particular
languages or topics). This targeted approach ensures detection reliability,
while improving watermark durability and quality under a range of real-world
deployment settings. Our evaluations show that domain-specific watermarking
enables model fingerprinting with strong statistical guarantees, controllable
false positive rates, high detection power, and preserved generation quality.
Moreover, we find that our fingerprints are inherently stealthy and naturally
robust to real-world variability across deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为StegoAttack的全隐蔽越狱攻击方法，利用隐写术将恶意查询隐藏在良性文本中，以规避大型语言模型的安全机制。

Motivation: 现有越狱攻击难以同时实现毒性隐蔽和语言自然性，因此需要一种更隐蔽的攻击方法来提高攻击成功率。

Method: 通过隐写术将有害查询嵌入语义连贯的良性文本，并引导模型提取和加密响应。

Result: 在四种安全对齐的大型语言模型上，StegoAttack平均攻击成功率达92.00%，且隐蔽性极佳。

Conclusion: StegoAttack展示了高效且隐蔽的越狱能力，为模型安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to large language models (LLMs) by
bypassing built-in safety mechanisms and leading to harmful outputs. Studying
these attacks is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and improving model
security. This paper presents a systematic survey of jailbreak methods from the
novel perspective of stealth. We find that existing attacks struggle to
simultaneously achieve toxic stealth (concealing toxic content) and linguistic
stealth (maintaining linguistic naturalness). Motivated by this, we propose
StegoAttack, a fully stealthy jailbreak attack that uses steganography to hide
the harmful query within benign, semantically coherent text. The attack then
prompts the LLM to extract the hidden query and respond in an encrypted manner.
This approach effectively hides malicious intent while preserving naturalness,
allowing it to evade both built-in and external safety mechanisms. We evaluate
StegoAttack on four safety-aligned LLMs from major providers, benchmarking
against eight state-of-the-art methods. StegoAttack achieves an average attack
success rate (ASR) of 92.00%, outperforming the strongest baseline by 11.0%.
Its ASR drops by less than 1% even under external detection (e.g., Llama
Guard). Moreover, it attains the optimal comprehensive scores on stealth
detection metrics, demonstrating both high efficacy and exceptional stealth
capabilities. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CoTSRF的新型大语言模型指纹识别方法，利用链式思维（CoT）作为指纹，通过对比学习提取指纹特征并验证其来源。

Motivation: 开源大语言模型（LLMs）性能优越但易被滥用，现有指纹识别方法无法实现隐蔽且鲁棒的验证。

Method: CoTSRF通过设计的CoT查询收集源LLM的响应，利用对比学习训练指纹提取器，并通过Kullback-Leibler散度进行指纹验证。

Result: 实验表明，CoTSRF在指纹隐蔽性和鲁棒性方面具有优势。

Conclusion: CoTSRF为LLMs提供了一种有效的指纹识别解决方案。

Abstract: Despite providing superior performance, open-source large language models
(LLMs) are vulnerable to abusive usage. To address this issue, recent works
propose LLM fingerprinting methods to identify the specific source LLMs behind
suspect applications. However, these methods fail to provide stealthy and
robust fingerprint verification. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM
fingerprinting scheme, namely CoTSRF, which utilizes the Chain of Thought (CoT)
as the fingerprint of an LLM. CoTSRF first collects the responses from the
source LLM by querying it with crafted CoT queries. Then, it applies
contrastive learning to train a CoT extractor that extracts the CoT feature
(i.e., fingerprint) from the responses. Finally, CoTSRF conducts fingerprint
verification by comparing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the CoT
features of the source and suspect LLMs against an empirical threshold. Various
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the advantage of our proposed
CoTSRF for fingerprinting LLMs, particularly in stealthy and robust fingerprint
verification.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在实时网络搜索中通过恶意字体注入隐藏对抗提示的安全漏洞，揭示了恶意内容传递和敏感数据泄露的攻击场景，强调了加强LLM外部内容处理安全措施的重要性。

Motivation: 随着LLM与实时网络搜索和Model Context Protocol（MCP）等协议的集成，新的安全漏洞可能出现，尤其是通过外部资源（如网页）注入隐藏对抗提示的风险。

Method: 研究通过恶意字体注入（操纵代码到字形映射）在外部资源中隐藏对抗提示，并评估了“恶意内容传递”和“敏感数据泄露”两种攻击场景。

Result: 实验表明，间接提示结合恶意字体注入可绕过LLM的安全机制，成功率因数据敏感性和提示设计而异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在LLM处理外部内容时加强安全措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly equipped with capabilities of
real-time web search and integrated with protocols like Model Context Protocol
(MCP). This extension could introduce new security vulnerabilities. We present
a systematic investigation of LLM vulnerabilities to hidden adversarial prompts
through malicious font injection in external resources like webpages, where
attackers manipulate code-to-glyph mapping to inject deceptive content which
are invisible to users. We evaluate two critical attack scenarios: (1)
"malicious content relay" and (2) "sensitive data leakage" through MCP-enabled
tools. Our experiments reveal that indirect prompts with injected malicious
font can bypass LLM safety mechanisms through external resources, achieving
varying success rates based on data sensitivity and prompt design. Our research
underscores the urgent need for enhanced security measures in LLM deployments
when processing external content.

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于Gaia DR3数据的机器学习方法，通过训练三个变分自编码器（VAE）对恒星和类星体的变异性进行无监督分类，展示了光谱和光变曲线数据结合的优势。

Motivation: 利用Gaia DR3发布的多源数据产品，尤其是首次提供的低分辨率光谱和光变曲线，开发一种能够高效分类变源的无监督方法，为DR4做准备。

Method: 训练三个VAE模型，分别处理低分辨率光谱、G波段光变曲线和新型的幅度差异分布方法，将数据压缩为15维潜在空间表示。

Result: 潜在空间有效区分了主要变异性类别，揭示了光谱与光变曲线的协同作用，二维投影展示了与天体物理性质相关的密集区域。

Conclusion: 提出的潜在表示方法在分类、聚类和异常检测任务中具有重要价值，为天体物理发现提供了新工具。

Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry,
BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results
for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique
opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data
products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning
methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an
unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4
million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE),
which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and
generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a
novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G
band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is
compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional
latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The
learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes
between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated
through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent
space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and
low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the
different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent
variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with
astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for
astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent
representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks,
including classification, clustering and outlier detection.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了视觉语言基础模型与传统卷积神经网络（CNN）在多国胸片（CXR）数据集上的诊断性能和泛化能力，发现基础模型在准确率和任务覆盖范围上优于CNN，但儿童病例表现较差。

Motivation: 评估视觉语言基础模型在胸片诊断任务中的实际表现和泛化能力，尤其是与传统CNN的比较。

Method: 比较了八种CXR诊断模型（五种视觉语言基础模型和三种CNN架构）在37个标准化分类任务上的表现，使用了六种公共数据集和三种中国医院的私有数据集。

Result: 基础模型在公共和私有数据集上的表现均优于CNN，特别是在MAVL模型中表现最佳。儿童病例的诊断性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 结构化监督和提示设计对放射学AI有重要价值，未来需关注地理扩展和集成模型以实现临床应用。

Abstract: Foundation models leveraging vision-language pretraining have shown promise
in chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, yet their real-world performance across
diverse populations and diagnostic tasks remains insufficiently evaluated. This
study benchmarks the diagnostic performance and generalizability of foundation
models versus traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on multinational
CXR datasets. We evaluated eight CXR diagnostic models - five vision-language
foundation models and three CNN-based architectures - across 37 standardized
classification tasks using six public datasets from the USA, Spain, India, and
Vietnam, and three private datasets from hospitals in China. Performance was
assessed using AUROC, AUPRC, and other metrics across both shared and
dataset-specific tasks. Foundation models outperformed CNNs in both accuracy
and task coverage. MAVL, a model incorporating knowledge-enhanced prompts and
structured supervision, achieved the highest performance on public (mean AUROC:
0.82; AUPRC: 0.32) and private (mean AUROC: 0.95; AUPRC: 0.89) datasets,
ranking first in 14 of 37 public and 3 of 4 private tasks. All models showed
reduced performance on pediatric cases, with average AUROC dropping from 0.88
+/- 0.18 in adults to 0.57 +/- 0.29 in children (p = 0.0202). These findings
highlight the value of structured supervision and prompt design in radiologic
AI and suggest future directions including geographic expansion and ensemble

Motivation: 现有GAN反演方法在高重建质量、有效可编辑性和计算效率之间难以平衡，MambaStyle旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种集成VSSM的单阶段编码器架构，减少参数和计算复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，MambaStyle在反演精度、编辑质量和计算效率之间取得了优越的平衡，且模型复杂度低、推理速度快。

Conclusion: MambaStyle适合实时应用，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The task of inverting real images into StyleGAN's latent space to manipulate
their attributes has been extensively studied. However, existing GAN inversion
methods struggle to balance high reconstruction quality, effective editability,
and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaStyle, an
efficient single-stage encoder-based approach for GAN inversion and editing
that leverages vision state-space models (VSSMs) to address these challenges.
Specifically, our approach integrates VSSMs within the proposed architecture,
enabling high-quality image inversion and flexible editing with significantly
fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that MambaStyle achieves a
superior balance among inversion accuracy, editing quality, and computational
efficiency. Notably, our method achieves superior inversion and editing results
with reduced model complexity and faster inference, making it suitable for
real-time applications.

TL;DR: 该论文通过开发一个针对低信噪比和有限数据集的扩散概率生成模型训练流程，加速了NICU中的新生儿MRI扫描时间。

Motivation: 在NICU中使用永久磁体扫描仪进行MRI扫描时间长，主要由于低信噪比和有限的接收线圈。研究旨在通过扩散概率生成模型解决这一问题。

Method: 通过修改现有网络架构、使用学习类别嵌入向量训练单一模型、应用自监督去噪以及通过后样本平均重建，建立了一个新的训练流程。

Result: 实验表明，该模型能够在不重新训练的情况下处理两种加速率，且从1.5倍欠采样数据重建的图像适合临床使用。

Conclusion: 扩散概率生成模型结合提出的流程，可以有效减少NICU中新生儿MRI的扫描时间。

Abstract: Purpose: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of
brain abnormalities during early life development. Permanent magnet scanners
operating in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) facilitate MRI of sick
infants, but have long scan times due to lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and
limited receive coils. This work accelerates in-NICU MRI with diffusion
probabilistic generative models by developing a training pipeline accounting
for these challenges.
  Methods: We establish a novel training dataset of clinical, 1 Tesla neonatal
MR images in collaboration with Aspect Imaging and Sha'are Zedek Medical
Center. We propose a pipeline to handle the low quantity and SNR of our
real-world dataset (1) modifying existing network architectures to support
varying resolutions; (2) training a single model on all data with learned class
embedding vectors; (3) applying self-supervised denoising before training; and
(4) reconstructing by averaging posterior samples. Retrospective under-sampling
experiments, accounting for signal decay, evaluated each item of our proposed
methodology. A clinical reader study with practicing pediatric
neuroradiologists evaluated our proposed images reconstructed from 1.5x
under-sampled data.
  Results: Combining all data, denoising pre-training, and averaging posterior
samples yields quantitative improvements in reconstruction. The generative
model decouples the learned prior from the measurement model and functions at
two acceleration rates without re-training. The reader study suggests that
proposed images reconstructed from approximately 1.5x under-sampled data are
adequate for clinical use.
  Conclusion: Diffusion probabilistic generative models applied with the
proposed pipeline to handle challenging real-world datasets could reduce scan
time of in-NICU neonatal MRI.

TL;DR: GENESIS是一种基于约束的算法，利用基因型的自然因果优势推断转录组数据中的祖先关系，解决了多组学数据因果发现的高维度和隐藏混杂因素问题。

Motivation: 在多组学数据中，基因调控机制的因果发现因高维度、直接与间接关系的区分及隐藏混杂因素而极具挑战，需要新方法来提高准确性。

Method: GENESIS通过初始化空祖先矩阵，逐步填充直接、间接或非因果关系，利用基因型作为固定因果锚点，结合边际和条件独立性测试。

Result: GENESIS在合成和真实基因组数据集上表现良好，能够高效发现复杂性状中的因果路径。

Conclusion: GENESIS为功能基因组学、药物发现和精准医学提供了强大的因果发现工具。

Abstract: Causal discovery in multi-omic datasets is crucial for understanding the
bigger picture of gene regulatory mechanisms, but remains challenging due to
high dimensionality, differentiation of direct from indirect relationships, and
hidden confounders. We introduce GENESIS (GEne Network inference from
Expression SIgnals and SNPs), a constraint-based algorithm that leverages the
natural causal precedence of genotypes to infer ancestral relationships in
transcriptomic data. Unlike traditional causal discovery methods that start
with a fully connected graph, GENESIS initialises an empty ancestrality matrix
and iteratively populates it with direct, indirect or non-causal relationships
using a series of provably sound marginal and conditional independence tests.
By integrating genotypes as fixed causal anchors, GENESIS provides a principled
``head start'' to classical causal discovery algorithms, restricting the search
space to biologically plausible edges. We test GENESIS on synthetic and
real-world genomic datasets. This framework offers a powerful avenue for
uncovering causal pathways in complex traits, with promising applications to
functional genomics, drug discovery, and precision medicine.

Motivation: 染色体分析在遗传疾病诊断和癌症治疗中至关重要，但当前AI模型开发受限于数据复杂性和标注工作量，需要通用性强的解决方案。

Method: CHROMA通过自监督学习在84,000个样本（约400万张染色体图像）上预训练，学习染色体异常的可泛化表示。

Result: CHROMA在所有异常类型中表现优于其他方法，即使标注数据较少或数据集不平衡。

Conclusion: CHROMA减少了专家标注工作量，支持精准肿瘤学，使高级基因组分析更易普及。

Abstract: Chromosome analysis is vital for diagnosing genetic disorders and guiding
cancer therapy decisions through the identification of somatic clonal
aberrations. However, developing an AI model are hindered by the overwhelming
complexity and diversity of chromosomal abnormalities, requiring extensive
annotation efforts, while automated methods remain task-specific and lack
generalizability due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets spanning diverse
resource conditions. Here, we introduce CHROMA, a foundation model for
cytogenomics, designed to overcome these challenges by learning generalizable
representations of chromosomal abnormalities. Pre-trained on over 84,000
specimens (~4 million chromosomal images) via self-supervised learning, CHROMA
outperforms other methods across all types of abnormalities, even when trained
on fewer labelled data and more imbalanced datasets. By facilitating
comprehensive mapping of instability and clonal leisons across various
aberration types, CHROMA offers a scalable and generalizable solution for
reliable and automated clinical analysis, reducing the annotation workload for
experts and advancing precision oncology through the early detection of rare
genomic abnormalities, enabling broad clinical AI applications and making
advanced genomic analysis more accessible.

Abstract: Brain stroke remains one of the principal causes of death and disability
worldwide, yet most tabular-data prediction models still hover below the 95%
accuracy threshold, limiting real-world utility. Addressing this gap, the
present work develops and validates a completely data-driven and interpretable
machine-learning framework designed to predict strokes using ten routinely
gathered demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables sourced from a public
cohort of 4,981 records. We employ a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
to understand the dataset's structure and distribution, followed by rigorous
data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier removal, and
class imbalance correction using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
(SMOTE). To streamline feature selection, point-biserial correlation and
random-forest Gini importance were utilized, and ten varied
algorithms-encompassing tree ensembles, boosting, kernel methods, and a
multilayer neural network-were optimized using stratified five-fold
cross-validation. Their predictions based on probabilities helped us build the
proposed model, which included Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a
support-vector classifier, with logistic regression acting as a meta-learner.
The proposed model achieved an accuracy rate of 97.2% and an F1-score of
97.15%, indicating a significant enhancement compared to the leading individual
model, LightGBM, which had an accuracy of 91.4%. Our study's findings indicate
that rigorous preprocessing, coupled with a diverse hybrid model, can convert
low-cost tabular data into a nearly clinical-grade stroke-risk assessment tool.

Conclusion: 该方法显著推动了基于ControlNet的音效合成模型的发展。

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both
semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad
application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in
the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio
generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for
video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction.
ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative
models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to
handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch
models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted
using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between
ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose
SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward
video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a
single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video
features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a
frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated
conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common
foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform
strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of
ControlNet-based foley synthesis models. Demo page:

Abstract: The rapid advancement and expanding applications of Audio Large Language
Models (ALLMs) demand a rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness.
However, systematic research on evaluating these models, particularly
concerning risks unique to the audio modality, remains largely unexplored.
Existing evaluation frameworks primarily focus on the text modality or address
only a restricted set of safety dimensions, failing to adequately account for
the unique characteristics and application scenarios inherent to the audio
modality. We introduce AudioTrust-the first multifaceted trustworthiness
evaluation framework and benchmark specifically designed for ALLMs. AudioTrust
facilitates assessments across six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination,
safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. To comprehensively evaluate
these dimensions, AudioTrust is structured around 18 distinct experimental
setups. Its core is a meticulously constructed dataset of over 4,420 audio/text
samples, drawn from real-world scenarios (e.g., daily conversations, emergency
calls, voice assistant interactions), specifically designed to probe the
multifaceted trustworthiness of ALLMs. For assessment, the benchmark carefully
designs 9 audio-specific evaluation metrics, and we employ a large-scale
automated pipeline for objective and scalable scoring of model outputs.
Experimental results reveal the trustworthiness boundaries and limitations of
current state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs when confronted
with various high-risk audio scenarios, offering valuable insights for the
secure and trustworthy deployment of future audio models. Our platform and
benchmark are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.

automatic music transcription into a score-driven framework. Unlike previous
approaches that primarily focus on improvisation-based interactions, our work
establishes a balanced framework that combines composed structure with dynamic
interaction. Through real-time automatic transcription as its core mechanism,
the computer interprets and responds to the human performer's input in real
time, creating a musical dialogue that balances compositional intent with live
interaction while incorporating elements of unpredictability. In this paper, we
present the development process from composition to premiere performance,
including technical implementation, rehearsal process, and performance
considerations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合离散语音表示和基于扩散-Transformer的条件流匹配解码器的语音转换模型，在零样本跨语言任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 当前语音转换模型在零样本跨语言任务中表现不佳，尤其对于未见过的语言和口音泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用离散语音表示与基于扩散-Transformer的条件流匹配解码器相结合的方法，无需文本监督和多重编码器。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，为语音转换提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Voice Conversion research in recent times has increasingly focused on
improving the zero-shot capabilities of existing methods. Despite remarkable
advancements, current architectures still tend to struggle in zero-shot
cross-lingual settings. They are also often unable to generalize for speakers
of unseen languages and accents. In this paper, we adopt a simple yet effective
approach that combines discrete speech representations from self-supervised
models with a non-autoregressive Diffusion-Transformer based conditional flow
matching speech decoder. We show that this architecture allows us to train a
voice-conversion model in a purely textless, self-supervised fashion. Our
technique works without requiring multiple encoders to disentangle speech
features. Our model also manages to excel in zero-shot cross-lingual settings
even for unseen languages.

Conclusion: MDtrajNet-1克服了传统MD的速度限制，为高效、可扩展的原子尺度模拟开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for exploring the behavior of
atomistic systems, but its reliance on sequential numerical integration limits
simulation efficiency. We present MDtrajNet-1, a foundational AI model that
directly generates MD trajectories across chemical space, bypassing force
calculations and integration. This approach accelerates simulations by up to
two orders of magnitude compared to traditional MD, even those enhanced by
machine-learning interatomic potentials. MDtrajNet-1 combines equivariant
neural networks with a Transformer-based architecture to achieve strong
accuracy and transferability in predicting long-time trajectories for both
known and unseen systems. Remarkably, the errors of the trajectories generated
by MDtrajNet-1 for various molecular systems are close to those of the
conventional ab initio MD. The model's flexible design supports diverse
application scenarios, including different statistical ensembles, boundary
conditions, and interaction types. By overcoming the intrinsic speed barrier of
conventional MD, MDtrajNet-1 opens new frontiers in efficient and scalable
atomistic simulations.

Abstract: Effective disaster management requires timely access to accurate and
contextually relevant information. Existing Information Retrieval (IR)
benchmarks, however, focus primarily on general or specialized domains, such as
medicine or finance, neglecting the unique linguistic complexity and diverse
information needs encountered in disaster management scenarios. To bridge this
gap, we introduce DisastIR, the first comprehensive IR evaluation benchmark
specifically tailored for disaster management. DisastIR comprises 9,600 diverse
user queries and more than 1.3 million labeled query-passage pairs, covering 48
distinct retrieval tasks derived from six search intents and eight general
disaster categories that include 301 specific event types. Our evaluations of
30 state-of-the-art retrieval models demonstrate significant performance
variances across tasks, with no single model excelling universally.
Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal significant performance gaps between
general-domain and disaster management-specific tasks, highlighting the

Conclusion: AutoData高效、低成本，适用于多领域数据收集任务。

Abstract: The exponential growth of data-driven systems and AI technologies has
intensified the demand for high-quality web-sourced datasets. While existing
datasets have proven valuable, conventional web data collection approaches face
significant limitations in terms of human effort and scalability. Current
data-collecting solutions fall into two categories: wrapper-based methods that
struggle with adaptability and reproducibility, and large language model
(LLM)-based approaches that incur substantial computational and financial
costs. To address these challenges, we propose AutoData, a novel multi-agent
system for Automated web Data collection, that requires minimal human
intervention, i.e., only necessitating a natural language instruction
specifying the desired dataset. In addition, AutoData is designed with a robust
multi-agent architecture, featuring a novel oriented message hypergraph
coordinated by a central task manager, to efficiently organize agents across
research and development squads. Besides, we introduce a novel hypergraph cache
system to advance the multi-agent collaboration process that enables efficient
automated data collection and mitigates the token cost issues prevalent in
existing LLM-based systems. Moreover, we introduce Instruct2DS, a new benchmark
dataset supporting live data collection from web sources across three domains:
academic, finance, and sports. Comprehensive evaluations over Instruct2DS and
three existing benchmark datasets demonstrate AutoData's superior performance
compared to baseline methods. Case studies on challenging tasks such as picture
book collection and paper extraction from surveys further validate its
applicability. Our source code and dataset are available at

Method: 提出了系统化的方法构建挑战性查询，设计了专用于动态代理信息检索的评估框架和细粒度指标。

Result: 通过实验揭示了代理行为的细微差异，为未来研究提供了实用建议。

Conclusion: InfoDeepSeek填补了现有基准测试的不足，能够更好地评估动态网络环境中的信息检索行为。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
grounding responses with retrieved information. As an emerging paradigm,
Agentic RAG further enhances this process by introducing autonomous LLM agents
into the information seeking process. However, existing benchmarks fall short
in evaluating such systems, as they are confined to a static retrieval
environment with a fixed, limited corpus} and simple queries that fail to
elicit agentic behavior. Moreover, their evaluation protocols assess
information seeking effectiveness by pre-defined gold sets of documents, making
them unsuitable for the open-ended and dynamic nature of real-world web
environments. To bridge this gap, we present InfoDeepSeek, a new benchmark with
challenging questions designed for assessing agentic information seeking in
real-world, dynamic web environments. We propose a systematic methodology for
constructing challenging queries satisfying the criteria of determinacy,
difficulty, and diversity. Based on this, we develop the first evaluation
framework tailored to dynamic agentic information seeking, including
fine-grained metrics about the accuracy, utility, and compactness of
information seeking outcomes. Through extensive experiments across LLMs, search
engines, and question types, InfoDeepSeek reveals nuanced agent behaviors and
offers actionable insights for future research.

TL;DR: Aug2Search利用生成式AI（特别是LLMs）生成高质量合成数据，通过多模式和多任务方法优化基于嵌入检索（EBR）模型的查询-产品相关性。实验表明，合成数据能显著提升模型性能，甚至优于原始数据训练的模型。

Motivation: 现有的搜索日志数据缺乏多样性和细节，限制了EBR模型捕捉细微搜索模式的能力，因此需要利用生成式AI生成合成数据来弥补这一不足。

Method: 采用Aug2Search框架，结合LLMs生成合成数据（包括查询生成、产品列表增强和基于增强列表的查询生成），并在不同数据集（原始数据、合成数据及混合数据）上训练EBR模型。

Result: 实验证明，Llama模型生成的合成数据具有高相关性、多样性和低幻觉率；Aug2Search在ROC_AUC指标上提升了4%，且仅用合成数据训练的模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 生成式AI生成的合成数据可以有效增强EBR模型的性能，尤其是在数据匮乏的场景下，为搜索相关性优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search
engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results.
However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the
diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the
models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge,
we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data
generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask
approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the
capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating
high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models.
We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points
from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three
strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3)
generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different
datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., "Click" and "Listing
Interactions")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic
data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings
underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and
listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low
levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in
ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the
same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data
often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original
and synthetic data.

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验验证了Conf-GNNRec在预测置信度和推荐性能上的有效性。

Conclusion: Conf-GNNRec能有效解决噪声环境中的过自信问题，提升推荐系统的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems based on graph neural networks perform well in tasks such
as rating and ranking. However, in real-world recommendation scenarios, noise
such as user misuse and malicious advertisement gradually accumulates through
the message propagation mechanism. Even if existing studies mitigate their
effects by reducing the noise propagation weights, the severe sparsity of the
recommender system still leads to the low-weighted noisy neighbors being
mistaken as meaningful information, and the prediction result obtained based on
the polluted nodes is not entirely trustworthy. Therefore, it is crucial to
measure the confidence of the prediction results in this highly noisy
framework. Furthermore, our evaluation of the existing representative GNN-based
recommendation shows that it suffers from overconfidence. Based on the above
considerations, we propose a new method to quantify and calibrate the
prediction confidence of GNN-based recommendations (Conf-GNNRec). Specifically,
we propose a rating calibration method that dynamically adjusts excessive
ratings to mitigate overconfidence based on user personalization. We also
design a confidence loss function to reduce the overconfidence of negative
samples and effectively improve recommendation performance. Experiments on
public datasets demonstrate the validity of Conf-GNNRec in prediction
confidence and recommendation performance.

Conclusion: MMDocRAG 为多模态 DocVQA 提供了严格测试平台和实用改进方向，推动了多模态证据检索和集成的发展。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) faces dual challenges in
processing lengthy multimodal documents (text, images, tables) and performing
cross-modal reasoning. Current document retrieval-augmented generation (DocRAG)
methods remain limited by their text-centric approaches, frequently missing
critical visual information. The field also lacks robust benchmarks for
assessing multimodal evidence selection and integration. We introduce MMDocRAG,
a comprehensive benchmark featuring 4,055 expert-annotated QA pairs with
multi-page, cross-modal evidence chains. Our framework introduces innovative
metrics for evaluating multimodal quote selection and enables answers that
interleave text with relevant visual elements. Through large-scale experiments
with 60 VLM/LLM models and 14 retrieval systems, we identify persistent
challenges in multimodal evidence retrieval, selection, and integration.Key
findings reveal advanced proprietary LVMs show superior performance than
open-sourced alternatives. Also, they show moderate advantages using multimodal
inputs over text-only inputs, while open-source alternatives show significant
performance degradation. Notably, fine-tuned LLMs achieve substantial
improvements when using detailed image descriptions. MMDocRAG establishes a
rigorous testing ground and provides actionable insights for developing more
robust multimodal DocVQA systems. Our benchmark and code are available at

Result: StandardRR在相同训练条件下优于ReasonRR，且关闭推理的ReasonRR-NoReason表现更好。

Conclusion: 推理过程的局限性导致重排名器无法考虑段落的部分相关性，影响准确性。

Abstract: With the growing success of reasoning models across complex natural language
tasks, researchers in the Information Retrieval (IR) community have begun
exploring how similar reasoning capabilities can be integrated into passage
rerankers built on Large Language Models (LLMs). These methods typically employ
an LLM to produce an explicit, step-by-step reasoning process before arriving
at a final relevance prediction. But, does reasoning actually improve reranking
accuracy? In this paper, we dive deeper into this question, studying the impact
of the reasoning process by comparing reasoning-based pointwise rerankers
(ReasonRR) to standard, non-reasoning pointwise rerankers (StandardRR) under
identical training conditions, and observe that StandardRR generally
outperforms ReasonRR. Building on this observation, we then study the
importance of reasoning to ReasonRR by disabling its reasoning process
(ReasonRR-NoReason), and find that ReasonRR-NoReason is surprisingly more
effective than ReasonRR. Examining the cause of this result, our findings
reveal that reasoning-based rerankers are limited by the LLM's reasoning
process, which pushes it toward polarized relevance scores and thus fails to
consider the partial relevance of passages, a key factor for the accuracy of
pointwise rerankers.

TL;DR: 研究发现某些数据集可能对检索模型产生负面影响，提出了一种成本效益高的方法，通过级联LLM提示来识别和重新标记假阴性样本，实验结果显示该方法显著提升了模型性能。

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨训练数据质量对检索模型的影响，特别是假阴性样本（被错误标记为不相关的段落）的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于级联LLM提示的简单方法，用于识别并重新标记假阴性样本。

Result: 实验表明，重新标记假阴性样本显著提升了E5和Qwen2.5-7B等检索模型的性能，nDCG@10在BEIR和AIR-Bench上分别提高了0.7-1.4和1.7-1.8点。

Conclusion: 结论表明，通过提升训练数据质量，尤其是处理假阴性样本，可以显著改善检索模型的性能。

Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale
retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million
query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that
certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of
15 datasets from the BGE collection reduces the training set size by
2.35$\times$ and increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a
deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false
negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We
propose a simple, cost-effective approach using cascading LLM prompts to
identify and relabel hard negatives. Experimental results show that relabeling
false negatives with true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B
retrieval models by 0.7-1.4 nDCG@10 on BEIR and by 1.7-1.8 nDCG@10 on zero-shot
AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on
the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of the
cascading design is further supported by human annotation results, where we
find judgment by GPT-4o shows much higher agreement with humans than
GPT-4o-mini.

Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via
encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning
synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. Current
studies usually position LLMs as external reasoning modules to yield auxiliary
thought for augmenting conventional recommendation pipelines. However, such
decoupled designs are limited in significant resource cost and suboptimal joint
optimization. To address these issues, we propose \name, a unified large
recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capabilities. Initially, we
reconceptualize the model architecture to facilitate interleaved reasoning and
recommendation in the autoregressive process. Subsequently, we propose RecPO, a
corresponding reinforcement learning framework that optimizes \name\ both the
reasoning and recommendation capabilities simultaneously in a single policy
update; RecPO introduces a fused reward scheme that solely leverages
recommendation labels to simulate the reasoning capability, eliminating
dependency on specialized reasoning annotations. Experiments on three datasets
with various baselines verify the effectiveness of \name, showing relative
improvements of 68.67\% in Hit@5 and 45.21\% in NDCG@20. Code available at

TL;DR: DFGR是一种双流架构推荐系统，通过创新的交互模式提升效率，解决了HSTU方法的局限性，优于现有基线模型。

Motivation: 解决传统推荐系统中异构信息映射导致的不稳定性问题，并减少对人工特征工程的依赖。

Method: DFGR采用两流架构，集成了QKV模块中的真实流与虚假流交互模式，仅依赖用户历史行为和少量属性信息。

Result: 在开源和工业数据集上表现优于DIN、DCN等基线模型，同时研究了计算约束下的参数优化策略。

Conclusion: DFGR是一种高效且有效的下一代生成排序范式。

Abstract: We introduce the Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network (DFGR), a two-stream
architecture designed for recommendation systems. DFGR integrates innovative
interaction patterns between real and fake flows within the QKV modules of the
self-attention mechanism, enhancing both training and inference efficiency.
This approach effectively addresses a key limitation observed in Meta's
proposed HSTU generative recommendation approach, where heterogeneous
information volumes are mapped into identical vector spaces, leading to
training instability. Unlike traditional recommendation models, DFGR only
relies on user history behavior sequences and minimal attribute information,
eliminating the need for extensive manual feature engineering. Comprehensive
evaluations on open-source and industrial datasets reveal DFGR's superior
performance compared to established baselines such as DIN, DCN, DIEN, and
DeepFM. We also investigate optimal parameter allocation strategies under
computational constraints, establishing DFGR as an efficient and effective
next-generation generate ranking paradigm.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决AI系统中人类监督的伦理问题，提出道德练习作为培养相关美德的手段。

Method: 通过概念框架分析和三项试点研究（公司、跨学科AI团队、高等教育学生），验证道德练习的实用性。

Result: 研究表明道德练习能促进组织内负责任的AI文化，但存在局限性，需进一步研究。

Conclusion: 道德练习为AI伦理实践提供了新思路，未来需深入探索其应用和优化。

Abstract: This paper elaborates on the concept of moral exercises as a means to help AI
actors cultivate virtues that enable effective human oversight of AI systems.
We explore the conceptual framework and significance of moral exercises,
situating them within the contexts of philosophical discourse, ancient
practices, and contemporary AI ethics scholarship. We outline the core pillars
of the moral exercises methodology - eliciting an engaged personal disposition,
fostering relational understanding, and cultivating technomoral wisdom - and
emphasize their relevance to key activities and competencies essential for
human oversight of AI systems. Our argument is supported by findings from three
pilot studies involving a company, a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers,
and higher education students. These studies allow us to explore both the
potential and the limitations of moral exercises. Based on the collected data,
we offer insights into how moral exercises can foster a responsible AI culture
within organizations, and suggest directions for future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究分析纽约州和纽约市的房地产所有权模式，揭示种族差异。使用LSTM+Geo和XGBoost结合的种族/民族预测模型（准确率89.2%），发现白人在房地产所有权中占比过高，而黑人、西班牙裔和亚裔社区占比不足，尤其是在少数族裔为主的社区。公司所有制加剧了这一不平等。

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示房地产所有权中的种族不平等现象，特别是在少数族裔为主的社区中的显著差距，以数据驱动的方式提出政策建议。

Method: 使用LSTM+Geo结合XGBoost的种族/民族预测模型，比较预测的所有者种族构成与人口普查数据中的居民种族构成。分析了全州模型和仅基于名称的LSTM模型。

Result: 白人在房地产所有权和价值中占比过高，黑人、西班牙裔和亚裔社区占比不足。公司所有制进一步加剧了城市少数族裔社区的所有权不平等。

Conclusion: 研究发现房地产所有权中存在显著的种族不平等，反映了历史和社会经济因素的影响，强调了数据驱动方法的重要性。

Abstract: This study analyzes tract-level real estate ownership patterns in New York
State (NYS) and New York City (NYC) to uncover racial disparities. We use an
advanced race/ethnicity imputation model (LSTM+Geo with XGBoost filtering,
validated at 89.2% accuracy) to compare the predicted racial composition of
property owners to the resident population from census data. We examine both a
Full Model (statewide) and a Name-Only LSTM Model (NYC) to assess how
incorporating geospatial context affects our predictions and disparity
estimates. The results reveal significant inequities: White individuals hold a
disproportionate share of properties and property value relative to their
population, while Black, Hispanic, and Asian communities are underrepresented
as property owners. These disparities are most pronounced in minority-majority
neighborhoods, where ownership is predominantly White despite a predominantly
non-White population. Corporate ownership (LLCs, trusts, etc.) exacerbates
these gaps by reducing owner-occupied opportunities in urban minority
communities. We provide a breakdown of ownership vs. population by race for
majority-White, -Black, -Hispanic, and -Asian tracts, identify those with
extreme ownership disparities, and compare patterns in urban, suburban, and
rural contexts. The findings underscore persistent racial inequity in property
ownership, reflecting broader historical and socio-economic forces, and
highlight the importance of data-driven approaches to address these issues.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个数学框架，阐述了在编码平滑变化刺激特征的神经回路中，网络状态自动重新激活的充分条件。

Motivation: 理解任务优化的神经网络在无输入条件下如何自主重新激活与在线行为相同的网络状态。

Method: 通过数学推导和数值实验，研究了基于感官信息的噪声循环网络，验证了去噪动态的自然发展。

Result: 研究发现，优化的噪声网络在无输入时会重新访问在线活动期间的状态配置。

Conclusion: 研究为离线重新激活是噪声神经回路中任务优化的自然结果提供了理论支持。

Abstract: During periods of quiescence, such as sleep, neural activity in many brain
circuits resembles that observed during periods of task engagement. However,
the precise conditions under which task-optimized networks can autonomously
reactivate the same network states responsible for online behavior is poorly
understood. In this study, we develop a mathematical framework that outlines
sufficient conditions for the emergence of neural reactivation in circuits that
encode features of smoothly varying stimuli. We demonstrate mathematically that
noisy recurrent networks optimized to track environmental state variables using
change-based sensory information naturally develop denoising dynamics, which,
in the absence of input, cause the network to revisit state configurations
observed during periods of online activity. We validate our findings using
numerical experiments on two canonical neuroscience tasks: spatial position
estimation based on self-motion cues, and head direction estimation based on
angular velocity cues. Overall, our work provides theoretical support for
modeling offline reactivation as an emergent consequence of task optimization
in noisy neural circuits.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个系统化的分类法，用于评估大型音频语言模型（LALMs），并通过四个维度（通用听觉能力、知识与推理、对话能力、公平性）进行分类，为未来研究提供了指导。

Motivation: 现有评估LALMs表现的基准缺乏系统性分类，因此论文旨在填补这一空白，为社区提供清晰的评估指南。

Method: 通过全面调查和分类，建立了一个四维度的评估框架，并对每个类别进行了详细概述。

Result: 提出了首个专门针对LALMs评估的系统分类法，并计划持续维护相关数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作为LALMs评估提供了结构化框架，促进未来研究的标准化和进步。

Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large
language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to
demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous
benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented
and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive
survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing
them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory
Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented
Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed
overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering
insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing
clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the
surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the
field.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种零样本解码器Dysfluent-WFST，用于同时转录音素和检测言语不流畅性，无需额外训练，性能优越。

Motivation: 传统方法在言语不流畅性检测中分类能力不足，且文本无关模型易误判。本研究旨在通过显式建模发音行为改进检测系统。

Method: 采用Dysfluent-WFST解码器，结合上游编码器（如WavLM），无需额外训练，同时进行音素转录和不流畅性检测。

Result: 在模拟和真实语音数据上，实现了音素错误率和不流畅性检测的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模发音行为的解码方法优于复杂架构，提高了不流畅性处理系统的性能。

Abstract: Automatic detection of speech dysfluency aids speech-language pathologists in
efficient transcription of disordered speech, enhancing diagnostics and
treatment planning. Traditional methods, often limited to classification,
provide insufficient clinical insight, and text-independent models misclassify
dysfluency, especially in context-dependent cases. This work introduces
Dysfluent-WFST, a zero-shot decoder that simultaneously transcribes phonemes
and detects dysfluency. Unlike previous models, Dysfluent-WFST operates with
upstream encoders like WavLM and requires no additional training. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both phonetic error rate and dysfluency
detection on simulated and real speech data. Our approach is lightweight,
interpretable, and effective, demonstrating that explicit modeling of
pronunciation behavior in decoding, rather than complex architectures, is key
to improving dysfluency processing systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态方法，用于更精确地评估精神分裂症的症状严重程度，而非传统的简单分类。

Motivation: 传统方法将精神分裂症简化为分类问题，忽视了症状的复杂性，降低了临床应用价值。

Method: 开发了单模态和多模态模型，结合语音、视频和文本输入，用于症状严重程度估计。

Result: 通过多模态框架提高了准确性和稳健性，能够更详细地捕捉症状特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能提升诊断精确性，支持个性化治疗，为心理健康评估提供了可扩展的客观工具。

Abstract: Studies on schizophrenia assessments using deep learning typically treat it
as a classification task to detect the presence or absence of the disorder,
oversimplifying the condition and reducing its clinical applicability. This
traditional approach overlooks the complexity of schizophrenia, limiting its
practical value in healthcare settings. This study shifts the focus to
individual symptom severity estimation using a multimodal approach that
integrates speech, video, and text inputs. We develop unimodal models for each
modality and a multimodal framework to improve accuracy and robustness. By
capturing a more detailed symptom profile, this approach can help in enhancing
diagnostic precision and support personalized treatment, offering a scalable
and objective tool for mental health assessment.

TL;DR: Meta-PerSER 是一种新型元学习框架，通过个性化适应每位听众的情感解释方式，显著提升语音情感识别（SER）。

Motivation: 传统 SER 系统依赖群体标注，忽略了个人差异，导致预测不一致。

Method: Meta-PerSER 采用 MAML 方法，结合组合集元训练、导数退火和分层分步学习率，利用少量标注快速适应个人风格，并结合自监督模型的鲁棒表征。

Result: 在 IEMOCAP 数据集上，Meta-PerSER 在已知和未知数据场景中均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Meta-PerSER 展示了在个性化情感识别中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Meta-PerSER, a novel meta-learning framework that
personalizes Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) by adapting to each listener's
unique way of interpreting emotion. Conventional SER systems rely on aggregated
annotations, which often overlook individual subtleties and lead to
inconsistent predictions. In contrast, Meta-PerSER leverages a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML) approach enhanced with Combined-Set Meta-Training,
Derivative Annealing, and per-layer per-step learning rates, enabling rapid
adaptation with only a few labeled examples. By integrating robust
representations from pre-trained self-supervised models, our framework first
captures general emotional cues and then fine-tunes itself to personal
annotation styles. Experiments on the IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate that
Meta-PerSER significantly outperforms baseline methods in both seen and unseen
data scenarios, highlighting its promise for personalized emotion recognition.

Motivation: 解决声学和文本模态间的异构性问题，以提升关键词检测中多模态嵌入的直接比较能力。

Method: 采用深度度量学习（DML）和模态对抗学习（MAL），通过模态分类器对抗训练实现模态不变嵌入，并在音素级别对齐声学和文本嵌入。

Result: 在WSJ和LibriPhrase数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著减少了声学和文本模态间的差异，提升了嵌入对齐的效果。

Abstract: For text enrollment-based open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS), acoustic
and text embeddings are typically compared at either the phoneme or utterance
level. To facilitate this, we optimize acoustic and text encoders using deep
metric learning (DML), enabling direct comparison of multi-modal embeddings in
a shared embedding space. However, the inherent heterogeneity between audio and
text modalities presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Modality Adversarial Learning (MAL), which reduces the domain gap in
heterogeneous modality representations. Specifically, we train a modality
classifier adversarially to encourage both encoders to generate
modality-invariant embeddings. Additionally, we apply DML to achieve
phoneme-level alignment between audio and text, and conduct comprehensive
comparisons across various DML objectives. Experiments on the Wall Street
Journal (WSJ) and LibriPhrase datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

Motivation: 解决真实环境中说话人识别系统因环境不匹配导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型，在训练阶段对干净和嘈杂的说话人嵌入逐步添加高斯噪声，再通过反向过程重建为干净嵌入；推理时通过扩散过程重新生成嵌入。

Result: 在模拟环境不匹配的评估集上，识别准确率比基线模型提高高达19.6%，同时在常规场景下保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需说话人标签或修改现有识别流程，有效提升了环境不匹配场景下的识别性能。

Abstract: A primary challenge when deploying speaker recognition systems in real-world
applications is performance degradation caused by environmental mismatch. We
propose a diffusion-based method that takes speaker embeddings extracted from a
pre-trained speaker recognition model and generates refined embeddings. For
training, our approach progressively adds Gaussian noise to both clean and
noisy speaker embeddings extracted from clean and noisy speech, respectively,
via forward process of a diffusion model, and then reconstructs them to clean
embeddings in the reverse process. While inferencing, all embeddings are
regenerated via diffusion process. Our method needs neither speaker label nor
any modification to the existing speaker recognition pipeline. Experiments on
evaluation sets simulating environment mismatch scenarios show that our method
can improve recognition accuracy by up to 19.6% over baseline models while
retaining performance on conventional scenarios. We publish our code here

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种时域灵活编码（TFC）技术，首次将可变帧率（VFR）引入神经语音编解码器，提高了效率和灵活性。

Motivation: 传统的恒定帧率（CFR）机制在语音编解码中效率不佳，因为语音段具有时变的信息密度，如无声间隔与有声区域。

Method: 提出TFC技术，通过动态分配帧率基于时间熵，实现平均帧率的无缝调整。

Result: 实验表明，TFC在保持高质量重建的同时，即使在低帧率下也保持竞争力。

Conclusion: TFC为低帧率神经语音编解码器的发展提供了潜力，有助于更高效的下游任务集成。

Abstract: Most neural speech codecs achieve bitrate adjustment through intra-frame
mechanisms, such as codebook dropout, at a Constant Frame Rate (CFR). However,
speech segments inherently have time-varying information density (e.g., silent
intervals versus voiced regions). This property makes CFR not optimal in terms
of bitrate and token sequence length, hindering efficiency in real-time
applications. In this work, we propose a Temporally Flexible Coding (TFC)
technique, introducing variable frame rate (VFR) into neural speech codecs for
the first time. TFC enables seamlessly tunable average frame rates and
dynamically allocates frame rates based on temporal entropy. Experimental
results show that a codec with TFC achieves optimal reconstruction quality with
high flexibility, and maintains competitive performance even at lower frame
rates. Our approach is promising for the integration with other efforts to
develop low-frame-rate neural speech codecs for more efficient downstream
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的主动语音增强（ASE）范式，通过结合Transformer-Mamba架构和任务特定损失函数，在去噪、去混响和去削波等任务上优于现有方法。

Motivation: 传统主动噪声消除（ANC）仅抑制外部干扰，未能主动优化语音信号，ASE旨在提升语音清晰度和感知质量。

Method: 采用Transformer-Mamba混合架构，设计任务特定损失函数，联合优化干扰抑制和信号增强。

Result: 在多种语音处理任务中表现优于现有基线，验证了主动目标调制在复杂环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE通过主动调整语音信号，显著提升语音处理效果。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for active sound modification: Active Speech
Enhancement (ASE). While Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) algorithms focus on
suppressing external interference, ASE goes further by actively shaping the
speech signal -- both attenuating unwanted noise components and amplifying
speech-relevant frequencies -- to improve intelligibility and perceptual
quality. To enable this, we propose a novel Transformer-Mamba-based
architecture, along with a task-specific loss function designed to jointly
optimize interference suppression and signal enrichment. Our method outperforms
existing baselines across multiple speech processing tasks -- including
denoising, dereverberation, and declipping -- demonstrating the effectiveness
of active, targeted modulation in challenging acoustic environments.

Motivation: 学生在学习过程中常常无法完全理解自己编写的代码，尤其在使用生成式AI工具的背景下，代码理解能力更为重要。

Method: 通过生成式AI自动生成多项选择题，并与CodeRunner自动评估平台结合。

Result: 自动生成的问题有助于学生发现理解错误，同时检测抄袭。

Conclusion: AutoMCQ提供了一种可扩展的方法，解决传统手动提问的低效问题。

Abstract: Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This
sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can
mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In
addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a
world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code
comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to
gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect
plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult
and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for
the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This
is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个大规模数据集SWE-Dev，用于评估和训练AI在真实世界功能开发任务中的表现，展示了其在高难度任务中的挑战性与改进潜力。

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在功能驱动开发（FDD）中的应用潜力，目前该任务在真实世界代码库中未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建了包含14,000训练和500测试样本的SWE-Dev数据集，提供可运行环境和单元测试，支持监督微调与强化学习。

Result: 当前AI在FDD任务中表现不佳（如Claude-3.7-Sonnet仅22.45%通过率），但通过微调，7B模型可媲美GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SWE-Dev是提升AI在功能开发任务中的有效平台，其高质量数据对模型改进至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capability in diverse software
engineering tasks, e.g. code completion, bug fixing, and document generation.
However, feature-driven development (FDD), a highly prevalent real-world task
that involves developing new functionalities for large, existing codebases,
remains underexplored. We therefore introduce SWE-Dev, the first large-scale
dataset (with 14,000 training and 500 test samples) designed to evaluate and
train autonomous coding systems on real-world feature development tasks. To
ensure verifiable and diverse training, SWE-Dev uniquely provides all instances
with a runnable environment and its developer-authored executable unit tests.
This collection not only provides high-quality data for Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), but also enables Reinforcement Learning (RL) by delivering accurate
reward signals from executable unit tests. Our extensive evaluations on
SWE-Dev, covering 17 chatbot LLMs, 10 reasoning models, and 10 Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS), reveal that FDD is a profoundly challenging frontier for current
AI (e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves only 22.45\% Pass@3 on the hard test
split). Crucially, we demonstrate that SWE-Dev serves as an effective platform
for model improvement: fine-tuning on training set enabled a 7B model
comparable to GPT-4o on \textit{hard} split, underscoring the value of its
high-quality training data. Code is available here

Conclusion: 开源LLMs可通过结合代码图结构有效解决存储库级任务，性能优于现有开源方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks
remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM
agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising
concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates
whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without
requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling
LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic
information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph
Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's
attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a
specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our
approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark
using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among
open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth
overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.

Abstract: We address the problem of verifying automatically procedural programs
manipulating parametric-size arrays of integers, encoded as a constrained Horn
clauses solving problem. We propose a new algorithmic method for synthesizing
loop invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions represented as universally
quantified first-order formulas constraining the array elements and program
variables. We adopt a data-driven approach that extends the decision tree
Horn-ICE framework to handle arrays. We provide a powerful learning technique
based on reducing a complex classification problem of vectors of integer arrays
to a simpler classification problem of vectors of integers. The obtained
classifier is generalized to get universally quantified invariants and
procedure pre/post-conditions. We have implemented our method and shown its
efficiency and competitiveness w.r.t. state-of-the-art tools on a significant
benchmark.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“通用数据格式”（CDF）的标准化足球数据格式，旨在解决不同数据提供商在数据收集、规格、表示和传输方式上的差异问题。

Motivation: 足球比赛中，不同数据提供商收集的数据存在差异，导致分析和利用这些数据时面临巨大障碍，增加了时间和金钱成本。

Method: 提出CDF格式，规定了五种比赛数据的最小模式：比赛名单数据、视频片段、事件数据、跟踪数据和比赛元数据，并确保数据清晰、完整。

Result: CDF提供了统一的技术规范和数据表示方式，简化了数据分析过程。

Conclusion: CDF标准化了足球数据，为下游分析任务提供了高效支持。

Abstract: During football matches, a variety of different parties (e.g., companies)
each collect (possibly overlapping) data about the match ranging from basic
information (e.g., starting players) to detailed positional data. This data is
provided to clubs, federations, and other organizations who are increasingly
interested in leveraging this data to inform their decision making.
Unfortunately, analyzing such data pose significant barriers because each
provider may (1) collect different data, (2) use different specifications even
within the same category of data, (3) represent the data differently, and (4)
delivers the data in a different manner (e.g., file format, protocol).
Consequently, working with these data requires a significant investment of time
and money. The goal of this work is to propose a uniform and standardized
format for football data called the Common Data Format (CDF). The CDF specifies
a minimal schema for five types of match data: match sheet data, video footage,
event data, tracking data, and match meta data. It aims to ensure that the
provided data is clear, sufficiently contextualized (e.g., its provenance is
clear), and complete such that it enables common downstream analysis tasks.
Concretely, this paper will detail the technical specifications of the CDF, the
representational choices that were made to help ensure the clarity of the
provided data, and a concrete approach for delivering data in the CDF.

TL;DR: 提出MAPS多语言基准测试套件，评估基于LLM的Agentic AI系统在多语言任务中的表现，发现性能和安全性的下降，并提出改进建议。

Motivation: 由于现有Agentic AI基准测试仅限于英语，无法评估多语言环境下的表现，可能导致非英语用户遭遇不可靠或安全隐患。

Method: 基于四种广泛使用的基准测试（GAIA、SWE-bench、MATH和Agent Security Benchmark），将其翻译成十种语言，形成805个任务和8,855个实例的MAPS套件。

Result: 实验表明，从英语切换到其他语言时，Agentic AI的性能和安全性均下降，严重程度与任务和翻译输入量相关。

Conclusion: MAPS为多语言环境下的Agentic AI系统提供了标准化评估框架，推动更公平、可靠且全球可访问的AI发展。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which build on Large Language Models (LLMs) and interact
with tools and memory, have rapidly advanced in capability and scope. Yet,
since LLMs have been shown to struggle in multilingual settings, typically
resulting in lower performance and reduced safety, agentic systems risk
inheriting these limitations. This raises concerns about the global
accessibility of such systems, as users interacting in languages other than
English may encounter unreliable or security-critical agent behavior. Despite
growing interest in evaluating agentic AI, existing benchmarks focus
exclusively on English, leaving multilingual settings unexplored. To address
this gap, we propose MAPS, a multilingual benchmark suite designed to evaluate
agentic AI systems across diverse languages and tasks. MAPS builds on four
widely used agentic benchmarks - GAIA (real-world tasks), SWE-bench (code
generation), MATH (mathematical reasoning), and the Agent Security Benchmark
(security). We translate each dataset into ten diverse languages, resulting in
805 unique tasks and 8,855 total language-specific instances. Our benchmark
suite enables a systematic analysis of how multilingual contexts affect agent
performance and robustness. Empirically, we observe consistent degradation in
both performance and security when transitioning from English to other
languages, with severity varying by task and correlating with the amount of
translated input. Building on these findings, we provide actionable
recommendations to guide agentic AI systems development and assessment under
multilingual settings. This work establishes a standardized evaluation
framework, encouraging future research towards equitable, reliable, and
globally accessible agentic AI. MAPS benchmark suite is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WikiDBGraph的大规模图结构数据集，用于解决现有表格数据研究中数据孤岛问题，并通过实验验证了协作学习的优越性能。

Motivation: 现有表格数据研究通常局限于单一表格或独立数据库，缺乏真实世界中互联的表格资源，限制了模型能力。

Method: 引入了WikiDBGraph数据集，包含10万个真实世界表格数据库，通过1700万条边连接，节点和边属性基于数据库结构和数据分布特征。

Result: 实验证明，在识别出的互联数据库上，协作学习表现更优，为结构化基础模型训练提供了可能。

Conclusion: WikiDBGraph为互联表格数据学习提供了重要资源，但也揭示了未来研究方向与挑战。

Abstract: Tabular data, ubiquitous and rich in informational value, is an increasing
focus for deep representation learning, yet progress is hindered by studies
centered on single tables or isolated databases, which limits model
capabilities due to data scale. While collaborative learning approaches such as
federated learning, transfer learning, split learning, and tabular foundation
models aim to learn from multiple correlated databases, they are challenged by
a scarcity of real-world interconnected tabular resources. Current data lakes
and corpora largely consist of isolated databases lacking defined
inter-database correlations. To overcome this, we introduce WikiDBGraph, a
large-scale graph of 100,000 real-world tabular databases from WikiData,
interconnected by 17 million edges and characterized by 13 node and 12 edge
properties derived from its database schema and data distribution.
WikiDBGraph's weighted edges identify both instance- and feature-overlapped
databases. Experiments on these newly identified databases confirm that
collaborative learning yields superior performance, thereby offering
considerable promise for structured foundation model training while also
exposing key challenges and future directions for learning from interconnected
tabular data.

Abstract: Materials are the foundation of modern society, underpinning advancements in
energy, electronics, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure. The
ability to discover and design new materials with tailored properties is
critical to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. In recent
years, the growing availability of high-quality materials data combined with
rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for
accelerating materials discovery. Data-driven generative models provide a
powerful tool for materials design by directly create novel materials that
satisfy predefined property requirements. Despite the proliferation of related
work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this
area. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent
progress in AI-driven materials generation. We first organize various types of
materials and illustrate multiple representations of crystalline materials. We
then provide a detailed summary and taxonomy of current AI-driven materials
generation approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the common evaluation metrics
and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude
with potential future directions and challenges in this fast-growing field. The

Motivation: 行人重识别（PRe-ID）在视频监控中具有重要应用，但特征提取和表示的挑战限制了其性能。本文旨在通过融合高维特征和多线性学习来提升识别效果。

Method: 提出HDFF方法，结合CNN和LOMO特征，引入张量融合方案；使用TXQDA进行多线性子空间学习，并通过余弦相似度进行匹配。

Result: 在VIPeR、GRID和PRID450S数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的先进方法。

Conclusion: HDFF和TXQDA的联合使用显著提高了PRe-ID的准确性，为解决高维数据问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Video surveillance image analysis and processing is a challenging field in
computer vision, with one of its most difficult tasks being Person
Re-Identification (PRe-ID). PRe-ID aims to identify and track target
individuals who have already been detected in a network of cameras, using a
robust description of their pedestrian images. The success of recent research
in person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and
representation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably
discriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are
modeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional
Feature Fusion (HDFF). Specifically, a new tensor fusion scheme is introduced
to leverage and combine these two types of features in a single tensor, even
though their dimensions are not identical. To enhance the system's accuracy, we
employ Tensor Cross-View Quadratic Analysis (TXQDA) for multilinear subspace
learning, followed by cosine similarity for matching. TXQDA efficiently
facilitates learning while reducing the high dimensionality inherent in
high-order tensor data. The effectiveness of our approach is verified through
experiments on three widely-used PRe-ID datasets: VIPeR, GRID, and PRID450S.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为GRIT的新方法，通过结合自然语言和图像中的边界框坐标来训练多模态语言模型（MLLM），以生成视觉基础推理链。

Motivation: 当前开源视觉推理模型仅使用纯自然语言生成推理内容，缺乏对视觉信息的显式整合，限制了其生成清晰且视觉基础的推理链的能力。

Method: GRIT提出了一种基础推理范式，模型生成的自然语言推理链中穿插输入图像的边界框坐标。此外，GRIT采用基于GRPO算法的强化学习方法GRPO-GR，通过关注最终答案准确性和基础推理输出的格式来优化模型。

Conclusion: GRIT成功地统一了推理和基础能力，为视觉基础推理任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in building reasoning models that articulate chains of thoughts prior to
producing final answers. However, despite ongoing advances that aim at enabling
reasoning for vision-language tasks, existing open-source visual reasoning
models typically generate reasoning content with pure natural language, lacking
explicit integration of visual information. This limits their ability to
produce clearly articulated and visually grounded reasoning chains. To this
end, we propose Grounded Reasoning with Images and Texts (GRIT), a novel method
for training MLLMs to think with images. GRIT introduces a grounded reasoning
paradigm, in which models generate reasoning chains that interleave natural
language and explicit bounding box coordinates. These coordinates point to
regions of the input image that the model consults during its reasoning
process. Additionally, GRIT is equipped with a reinforcement learning approach,
GRPO-GR, built upon the GRPO algorithm. GRPO-GR employs robust rewards focused
on the final answer accuracy and format of the grounded reasoning output, which
eliminates the need for data with reasoning chain annotations or explicit
bounding box labels. As a result, GRIT achieves exceptional data efficiency,
requiring as few as 20 image-question-answer triplets from existing datasets.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that GRIT effectively trains MLLMs to
produce coherent and visually grounded reasoning chains, showing a successful
unification of reasoning and grounding abilities.

Abstract: With video games now generating the highest revenues in the entertainment

Conclusion: 像素空间推理对提升VLM在视觉任务中的性能至关重要，论文提出的框架有效且实用。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning has significantly improved the performance of
Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains. However, this reasoning
process has been confined exclusively to textual space, limiting its
effectiveness in visually intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we
introduce the concept of reasoning in the pixel-space. Within this novel
framework, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are equipped with a suite of visual
reasoning operations, such as zoom-in and select-frame. These operations enable
VLMs to directly inspect, interrogate, and infer from visual evidences, thereby
enhancing reasoning fidelity for visual tasks. Cultivating such pixel-space
reasoning capabilities in VLMs presents notable challenges, including the
model's initially imbalanced competence and its reluctance to adopt the newly
introduced pixel-space operations. We address these challenges through a
two-phase training approach. The first phase employs instruction tuning on
synthesized reasoning traces to familiarize the model with the novel visual
operations. Following this, a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leverages a
curiosity-driven reward scheme to balance exploration between pixel-space
reasoning and textual reasoning. With these visual operations, VLMs can
interact with complex visual inputs, such as information-rich images or videos
to proactively gather necessary information. We demonstrate that this approach
significantly improves VLM performance across diverse visual reasoning
benchmarks. Our 7B model, \model, achieves 84\% on V* bench, 74\% on
TallyQA-Complex, and 84\% on InfographicsVQA, marking the highest accuracy
achieved by any open-source model to date. These results highlight the
importance of pixel-space reasoning and the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: CE-ViTs显著提升了共形预测性能，增强了模型在域偏移场景中的适应性。

Abstract: Exploring the trustworthiness of deep learning models is crucial, especially
in critical domains such as medical imaging decision support systems. Conformal
prediction has emerged as a rigorous means of providing deep learning models
with reliable uncertainty estimates and safety guarantees. However, conformal
prediction results face challenges due to the backbone model's struggles in
domain-shifted scenarios, such as variations in different sources. To aim this
challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework termed Conformal Ensemble of
Vision Transformers (CE-ViTs) designed to enhance image classification
performance by prioritizing domain adaptation and model robustness, while
accounting for uncertainty. The proposed method leverages an ensemble of vision
transformer models in the backbone, trained on diverse datasets including
HAM10000, Dermofit, and Skin Cancer ISIC datasets. This ensemble learning
approach, calibrated through the combined mentioned datasets, aims to enhance
domain adaptation through conformal learning. Experimental results underscore
that the framework achieves a high coverage rate of 90.38\%, representing an
improvement of 9.95\% compared to the HAM10000 model. This indicates a strong
likelihood that the prediction set includes the true label compared to singular
models. Ensemble learning in CE-ViTs significantly improves conformal
prediction performance, increasing the average prediction set size for
challenging misclassified samples from 1.86 to 3.075.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于稀疏自编码器（SAE）的免训练方法（SSL），通过识别与幻觉相关的语义方向，有效减少大视觉语言模型（LVLM）中的幻觉问题，同时保持模型性能和低时间开销。

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成的文本与视觉输入不一致。现有方法计算成本高，效果有限，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）识别与幻觉或现实相关的语义方向，提出SSL方法，通过干预这些方向来减少幻觉，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，SSL在减少幻觉方面显著优于现有解码方法，且在不同模型架构间具有良好迁移性，时间开销几乎可忽略。

Conclusion: SSL通过SAE识别的语义方向，提供了一种高效、低成本的幻觉缓解方案，为LVLM的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) and image captioning.
However, they still suffer from hallucinations, generating text inconsistent
with visual input, posing significant risks in real-world applications.
Existing approaches to address this issue focus on incorporating external
knowledge bases, alignment training, or decoding strategies, all of which
require substantial computational cost and time. Recent works try to explore
more efficient alternatives by adjusting LVLMs' internal representations.
Although promising, these methods may cause hallucinations to be insufficiently
suppressed or lead to excessive interventions that negatively affect normal
semantics. In this work, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify
semantic directions closely associated with either hallucinations or actuality,
realizing more precise and direct hallucination-related representations. Our
analysis demonstrates that interventions along the faithful direction we
identified can mitigate hallucinations, while those along the hallucinatory
direction can exacerbate them. Building on these insights, we propose Steering
LVLMs via SAE Latent Directions (SSL), a training-free method based on
SAE-derived latent directions to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SSL significantly outperforms existing decoding
approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining transferability
across different model architectures with negligible additional time overhead.

Abstract: Image classification benchmark datasets such as CIFAR, MNIST, and ImageNet
serve as critical tools for model evaluation. However, despite the cleaning
efforts, these datasets still suffer from pervasive noisy labels and often
contain missing labels due to the co-existing image pattern where multiple
classes appear in an image sample. This results in misleading model comparisons
and unfair evaluations. Existing label cleaning methods focus primarily on
noisy labels, but the issue of missing labels remains largely overlooked.
Motivated by these challenges, we present a comprehensive framework named
REVEAL, integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained vision-language models (e.g.,
LLaVA, BLIP, Janus, Qwen) with advanced machine/human label curation methods
(e.g., Docta, Cleanlab, MTurk), to systematically address both noisy labels and
missing label detection in widely-used image classification test sets. REVEAL
detects potential noisy labels and omissions, aggregates predictions from
various methods, and refines label accuracy through confidence-informed
predictions and consensus-based filtering. Additionally, we provide a thorough
analysis of state-of-the-art vision-language models and pre-trained image
classifiers, highlighting their strengths and limitations within the context of
dataset renovation by revealing 10 observations. Our method effectively reveals
missing labels from public datasets and provides soft-labeled results with
likelihoods. Through human verifications, REVEAL significantly improves the
quality of 6 benchmark test sets, highly aligning to human judgments and
enabling more accurate and meaningful comparisons in image classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuickVideo通过系统-算法协同设计，解决了长视频理解中的计算瓶颈问题，实现了实时处理。

Motivation: 长视频理解在视频监控、会议总结等应用中至关重要，但现有技术因解码和预填充成本高而难以实用。

Method: 提出QuickVideo，包括并行解码器QuickDecoder、内存高效预填充方法QuickPrefill以及CPU-GPU重叠处理方案。

Result: 实验表明，QuickVideo显著降低推理时间，支持在有限硬件上进行高质量长视频处理。

Conclusion: QuickVideo通过优化解码和预填充，实现了长视频理解的实用化和规模化。

Abstract: Long-video understanding has emerged as a crucial capability in real-world
applications such as video surveillance, meeting summarization, educational
lecture analysis, and sports broadcasting. However, it remains computationally
prohibitive for VideoLLMs, primarily due to two bottlenecks: 1) sequential
video decoding, the process of converting the raw bit stream to RGB frames can
take up to a minute for hour-long video inputs, and 2) costly prefilling of up
to several million tokens for LLM inference, resulting in high latency and
memory use. To address these challenges, we propose QuickVideo, a
system-algorithm co-design that substantially accelerates long-video
understanding to support real-time downstream applications. It comprises three
key innovations: QuickDecoder, a parallelized CPU-based video decoder that
achieves 2-3 times speedup by splitting videos into keyframe-aligned intervals
processed concurrently; QuickPrefill, a memory-efficient prefilling method
using KV-cache pruning to support more frames with less GPU memory; and an
overlapping scheme that overlaps CPU video decoding with GPU inference.
Together, these components infernece time reduce by a minute on long video
inputs, enabling scalable, high-quality video understanding even on limited
hardware. Experiments show that QuickVideo generalizes across durations and
sampling rates, making long video processing feasible in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 调查发现生成式AI能成功处理约33%的真实图像编辑请求，但在精确编辑任务上表现较差，且常出现非请求的修饰。

Motivation: 探索生成式AI在图像编辑中的应用潜力，了解用户常见的编辑需求及其与AI能力的匹配程度。

Method: 分析83k个Reddit社区12年间的编辑请求和305k个编辑结果，结合人类和AI评价。

Result: 33%的请求可被AI成功处理，AI在低创意任务上表现不佳，且经常做出非请求修饰。

Conclusion: 当前AI编辑器在创意任务上表现较好，但在精确编辑和身份保留上有欠缺。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image
editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25,
2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of
editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the
subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly
creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and
the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw
lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests
can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present
a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the
past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k
PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of
requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o,
Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on
low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended
tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and
frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM
judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits
more than human edits. Code and qualitative examples are available at:

TL;DR: VLM-R³是一个能够动态聚焦和迭代视觉区域的视觉语言模型，通过区域识别和推理提升多模态任务的精确性。

Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在复杂任务中难以动态聚焦和迭代视觉区域，限制了其在多模态任务中的表现。

Method: 提出VLM-R³框架，采用区域条件强化学习优化（R-GRPO），并结合VLIR语料库进行监督训练。

Result: VLM-R³在MathVista和ScienceQA等任务中取得零样本和小样本的新SOTA，尤其在需要空间推理的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: VLM-R³通过动态区域聚焦和推理，显著提升了多模态任务的性能，尤其在复杂视觉任务中效果显著。

Abstract: Recently, reasoning-based MLLMs have achieved a degree of success in
generating long-form textual reasoning chains. However, they still struggle
with complex tasks that necessitate dynamic and iterative focusing on and
revisiting of visual regions to achieve precise grounding of textual reasoning
in visual evidence. We introduce \textbf{VLM-R$^3$} (\textbf{V}isual
\textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel with \textbf{R}egion \textbf{R}ecognition and
\textbf{R}easoning), a framework that equips an MLLM with the ability to (i)
decide \emph{when} additional visual evidence is needed, (ii) determine
\emph{where} to ground within the image, and (iii) seamlessly weave the
relevant sub-image content back into an interleaved chain-of-thought. The core
of our method is \textbf{Region-Conditioned Reinforcement Policy Optimization
(R-GRPO)}, a training paradigm that rewards the model for selecting informative
regions, formulating appropriate transformations (e.g.\ crop, zoom), and
integrating the resulting visual context into subsequent reasoning steps. To
bootstrap this policy, we compile a modest but carefully curated Visuo-Lingual
Interleaved Rationale (VLIR) corpus that provides step-level supervision on
region selection and textual justification. Extensive experiments on MathVista,
ScienceQA, and other benchmarks show that VLM-R$^3$ sets a new state of the art
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, with the largest gains appearing on
questions demanding subtle spatial reasoning or fine-grained visual cue
extraction.

TL;DR: 提出DualComp，一种轻量级双模态无损压缩器，统一处理图像和文本数据，性能接近SOTA且推理速度快。

Motivation: 解决多模态数据压缩中单个压缩器不灵活、现有方法复杂度高的问题。

Method: 采用轻量级框架，结合模态统一标记化、模态切换上下文学习和模态路由混合专家技术，并重新参数化提升性能。

Result: DualComp在文本和图像数据集上性能接近SOTA，单模态变体在Kodak数据集上超越之前最佳压缩器9%，模型尺寸仅1.2%。

Conclusion: DualComp展示了轻量级双模态压缩的可行性，兼具高效性能和实用速度。

Abstract: Most learning-based lossless compressors are designed for a single modality,
requiring separate models for multi-modal data and lacking flexibility.
However, different modalities vary significantly in format and statistical
properties, making it ineffective to use compressors that lack
modality-specific adaptations. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
offer a potential solution for modality-unified compression, their excessive
complexity hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we focus
on the two most common modalities, image and text, and propose DualComp, the
first unified and lightweight learning-based dual-modality lossless compressor.
Built on a lightweight backbone, DualComp incorporates three key structural
enhancements to handle modality heterogeneity: modality-unified tokenization,
modality-switching contextual learning, and modality-routing
mixture-of-experts. A reparameterization training strategy is also used to
boost compression performance. DualComp integrates both modality-specific and
shared parameters for efficient parameter utilization, enabling near real-time
inference (200KB/s) on desktop CPUs. With much fewer parameters, DualComp
achieves compression performance on par with the SOTA LLM-based methods for
both text and image datasets. Its simplified single-modality variant surpasses
the previous best image compressor on the Kodak dataset by about 9% using just
1.2% of the model size.

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶需要处理多视角传感器数据并应对复杂驾驶场景，MoE架构在LLMs中的成功表明参数专用化具强扩展性。

Method: 基于Drive-π0 VLA基线，加入视觉MoE（动态选择摄像头）和动作MoE（激活行为专家），模拟人类驾驶注意力机制。

Result: 在Bench2Drive闭环评估中取得SOTA性能，证明了视觉和动作MoE结合的有效性。

Conclusion: DriveMoE通过专用化设计，避免了模式平均问题，在自动驾驶任务中表现优异。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) demands effective processing of
multi-view sensory data and robust handling of diverse and complex driving
scenarios, particularly rare maneuvers such as aggressive turns. Recent success
of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrates that specialization of parameters enables strong scalability. In
this work, we propose DriveMoE, a novel MoE-based E2E-AD framework, with a
Scene-Specialized Vision MoE and a Skill-Specialized Action MoE. DriveMoE is
built upon our $\pi_0$ Vision-Language-Action (VLA) baseline (originally from
the embodied AI field), called Drive-$\pi_0$. Specifically, we add Vision MoE
to Drive-$\pi_0$ by training a router to select relevant cameras according to
the driving context dynamically. This design mirrors human driving cognition,
where drivers selectively attend to crucial visual cues rather than
exhaustively processing all visual information. In addition, we add Action MoE
by training another router to activate specialized expert modules for different
driving behaviors. Through explicit behavioral specialization, DriveMoE is able
to handle diverse scenarios without suffering from modes averaging like
existing models. In Bench2Drive closed-loop evaluation experiments, DriveMoE
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the effectiveness
of combining vision and action MoE in autonomous driving tasks. We will release
our code and models of DriveMoE and Drive-$\pi_0$.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于属性聚焦的文本-图像检索方法，通过构建COCO-Facet基准测试，发现现有检索器在属性聚焦查询上的表现不佳，并提出了一种新的可提示图像嵌入方法。

Motivation: 现有的文本-图像检索器（如CLIP等）在处理属性聚焦查询时表现不佳，因为它们过于关注全局语义而忽略了细节属性。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建了COCO-Facet基准测试，并提出了一种可提示的图像嵌入方法，通过多模态检索器生成可聚焦特定属性的嵌入。

Result: 实验表明，可提示嵌入方法显著提升了检索性能，预定义提示和线性近似分别改善了15%和8%的召回率。

Conclusion: 通过可提示嵌入方法，可以有效提升属性聚焦查询的检索性能，并且方法具有通用性和实用性。

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide
crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of
this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual
attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling
attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with
9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like
retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot
ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image
embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other
details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model
(MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with
this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image
embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose
to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers,
which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for
deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base
retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two
acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear
approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5
when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when
prompts are only available during inference.

Abstract: This paper reports on the NTIRE 2025 challenge on Text to Image (T2I)
generation model quality assessment, which will be held in conjunction with the
New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement Workshop (NTIRE) at CVPR 2025.
The aim of this challenge is to address the fine-grained quality assessment of

from two aspects: image-text alignment and image structural distortion
detection, and is divided into the alignment track and the structural track.
The alignment track uses the EvalMuse-40K, which contains around 40K
AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) generated by 20 popular generative models. The
alignment track has a total of 371 registered participants. A total of 1,883
submissions are received in the development phase, and 507 submissions are
received in the test phase. Finally, 12 participating teams submitted their
models and fact sheets. The structure track uses the EvalMuse-Structure, which
contains 10,000 AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) with corresponding structural
distortion mask. A total of 211 participants have registered in the structure
track. A total of 1155 submissions are received in the development phase, and
487 submissions are received in the test phase. Finally, 8 participating teams
submitted their models and fact sheets. Almost all methods have achieved better
results than baseline methods, and the winning methods in both tracks have
demonstrated superior prediction performance on T2I model quality assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Video Question Answering (VideoQA) have introduced
LLM-based agents, modular frameworks, and procedural solutions, yielding
promising results. These systems use dynamic agents and memory-based mechanisms
to break down complex tasks and refine answers. However, significant
improvements remain in tracking objects for grounding over time and
decision-making based on reasoning to better align object references with
language model outputs, as newer models get better at both tasks. This work
presents an LLM-brained agent for zero-shot Video Question Answering (VideoQA)
that combines a Chain-of-Thought framework with grounding reasoning alongside
YOLO-World to enhance object tracking and alignment. This approach establishes
a new state-of-the-art in VideoQA and Video Understanding, showing enhanced
performance on NExT-QA, iVQA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. Our framework also
enables cross-checking of grounding timeframes, improving accuracy and

TL;DR: OViP框架通过动态构建基于模型自身幻觉输出的对比训练数据，有效减少大型视觉-语言模型的幻觉问题，同时保持多模态能力。

Motivation: 大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）存在幻觉问题，生成内容与视觉输入不一致。现有方法依赖预定义或随机编辑的负样本，无法反映实际模型错误，限制了训练效果。

Method: 提出在线视觉-语言偏好学习（OViP）框架，动态构建对比训练数据，利用扩散模型合成负样本，生成更具相关性的监督信号。

Result: 实验表明，OViP能有效减少幻觉问题，同时保留核心多模态能力。

Conclusion: OViP通过失败驱动的训练和动态数据构建，显著提升了模型对齐能力，为多模态对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to hallucination,
often generating content misaligned with visual inputs. While recent approaches
advance multi-modal Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate
hallucination, they typically rely on predefined or randomly edited negative
samples that fail to reflect actual model errors, limiting training efficacy.
In this work, we propose an Online Vision-language Preference Learning (OViP)
framework that dynamically constructs contrastive training data based on the
model's own hallucinated outputs. By identifying semantic differences between
sampled response pairs and synthesizing negative images using a diffusion
model, OViP generates more relevant supervision signals in real time. This
failure-driven training enables adaptive alignment of both textual and visual
preferences. Moreover, we refine existing evaluation protocols to better
capture the trade-off between hallucination suppression and expressiveness.
Experiments on hallucination and general benchmarks demonstrate that OViP
effectively reduces hallucinations while preserving core multi-modal
capabilities.

TL;DR: FPQVAR是一种高效的浮点量化框架，通过算法和硬件协同设计，显著降低了VAR模型的计算和内存成本，同时提高了图像生成质量。

Motivation: VAR模型在图像生成中表现出色，但参数大和计算成本高阻碍了其在边缘设备上的部署。FPQVAR旨在通过量化技术解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了Dual Format Quantization、Group-wise Hadamard Transformation和GHT-Aware Learnable Transformation，并设计了低比特浮点量化器和FPGA加速器。

Result: 4位量化下FID从10.83降到3.58，IS从175.9提升到241.5；6位量化性能接近FP16模型；FPGA加速器吞吐量达1.1图像/秒。

Conclusion: FPQVAR在量化效果和硬件效率上均优于现有方法，适合边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling has marked a paradigm shift in image
generation from next-token prediction to next-scale prediction. VAR predicts a
set of tokens at each step from coarse to fine scale, leading to better image
quality and faster inference speed compared to existing diffusion models.
However, the large parameter size and computation cost hinder its deployment on
edge devices. To reduce the memory and computation cost, we propose FPQVAR, an
efficient post-training floating-point (FP) quantization framework for VAR
featuring algorithm and hardware co-design. At the algorithm level, we first
identify the challenges of quantizing VAR. To address them, we propose Dual
Format Quantization for the highly imbalanced input activation. We further
propose Group-wise Hadamard Transformation and GHT-Aware Learnable
Transformation to address the time-varying outlier channels. At the hardware
level, we design the first low-bit FP quantizer and multiplier with lookup
tables on FPGA and propose the first FPGA-based VAR accelerator featuring
low-bit FP computation and an elaborate two-level pipeline. Extensive
experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art quantization method, our
proposed FPQVAR significantly improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from
10.83 to 3.58, Inception Score (IS) from 175.9 to 241.5 under 4-bit
quantization. FPQVAR also significantly improves the performance of 6-bit
quantized VAR, bringing it on par with the FP16 model. Our accelerator on
AMD-Xilinx VCK190 FPGA achieves a throughput of 1.1 image/s, which is 3.1x
higher than the integer-based accelerator. It also demonstrates 3.6x and 2.8x
higher energy efficiency compared to the integer-based accelerator and GPU
baseline, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于场景图的图像检索框架SCENIR，通过无监督的图自编码器消除对标记数据的依赖，并在性能和效率上优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有基于卷积和Transformer的架构易受低层次视觉特征（如颜色）的偏见影响，且现有场景图检索方法依赖监督学习，其标注数据的不一致性限制了可靠性。

Method: 提出SCENIR，一种基于图自编码器的无监督检索框架，利用图编辑距离（GED）作为场景图相似性的确定性度量。

Conclusion: SCENIR推动了图像检索领域的最新技术，特别是在反事实图像检索方面，同时提出了GED作为更可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: Despite the dominance of convolutional and transformer-based architectures in
image-to-image retrieval, these models are prone to biases arising from
low-level visual features, such as color. Recognizing the lack of semantic
understanding as a key limitation, we propose a novel scene graph-based
retrieval framework that emphasizes semantic content over superficial image
characteristics. Prior approaches to scene graph retrieval predominantly rely
on supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which require ground truth graph
pairs driven from image captions. However, the inconsistency of caption-based
supervision stemming from variable text encodings undermine retrieval
reliability. To address these, we present SCENIR, a Graph Autoencoder-based
unsupervised retrieval framework, which eliminates the dependence on labeled
training data. Our model demonstrates superior performance across metrics and
runtime efficiency, outperforming existing vision-based, multimodal, and
supervised GNN approaches. We further advocate for Graph Edit Distance (GED) as
a deterministic and robust ground truth measure for scene graph similarity,
replacing the inconsistent caption-based alternatives for the first time in
image-to-image retrieval evaluation. Finally, we validate the generalizability
of our method by applying it to unannotated datasets via automated scene graph
generation, while substantially contributing in advancing state-of-the-art in
counterfactual image retrieval.

Abstract: When emotions are repressed, an individual's true feelings may be revealed
through micro-expressions. Consequently, micro-expressions are regarded as a
genuine source of insight into an individual's authentic emotions. However, the
transient and highly localised nature of micro-expressions poses a significant
challenge to their accurate recognition, with the accuracy rate of
micro-expression recognition being as low as 50%, even for professionals. In
order to address these challenges, it is necessary to explore the field of
dynamic micro expression recognition (DMER) using multimodal fusion techniques,
with special attention to the diverse fusion of temporal and spatial modal
features. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal and Spatial feature Fusion
framework for DMER (TSFmicro). This framework integrates a Retention Network
(RetNet) and a transformer-based DMER network, with the objective of efficient
micro-expression recognition through the capture and fusion of temporal and
spatial relations. Meanwhile, we propose a novel parallel time-space fusion
method from the perspective of modal fusion, which fuses spatio-temporal
information in high-dimensional feature space, resulting in complementary
"where-how" relationships at the semantic level and providing richer semantic
information for the model. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the TSFmicro method in comparison to other contemporary
state-of-the-art methods. This is evidenced by its effectiveness on three
well-recognised micro-expression datasets.

TL;DR: DeCafNet提出了一种高效的长视频时间定位方法，通过引入辅助编码器和专家编码器协作策略，显著降低计算成本，同时提升定位性能。

Motivation: 为了解决长视频时间定位中因处理大量视频片段导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用'委托与征服'策略，结合辅助编码器和专家编码器，通过显著性图和Query-aware时序聚合优化特征处理。

Result: 在两个LTVG基准数据集上，DeCafNet计算量减少47%，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: DeCafNet在效率和性能上均达到新水平，为长视频时间定位提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Long Video Temporal Grounding (LVTG) aims at identifying specific moments
within lengthy videos based on user-provided text queries for effective content
retrieval. The approach taken by existing methods of dividing video into clips
and processing each clip via a full-scale expert encoder is challenging to
scale due to prohibitive computational costs of processing a large number of
clips in long videos. To address this issue, we introduce DeCafNet, an approach
employing ``delegate-and-conquer'' strategy to achieve computation efficiency
without sacrificing grounding performance. DeCafNet introduces a sidekick
encoder that performs dense feature extraction over all video clips in a
resource-efficient manner, while generating a saliency map to identify the most
relevant clips for full processing by the expert encoder. To effectively
leverage features from sidekick and expert encoders that exist at different
temporal resolutions, we introduce DeCaf-Grounder, which unifies and refines
them via query-aware temporal aggregation and multi-scale temporal refinement
for accurate grounding. Experiments on two LTVG benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DeCafNet reduces computation by up to 47\% while still outperforming
existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for LTVG in terms of both
efficiency and performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 利用Sparse Autoencoders（SAEs）分析深度学习视觉模型如何编码ImageNet层次结构，发现模型内部隐含了分类层次关系。

Motivation: 探讨视觉模型是否在内部表示中体现了ImageNet分类的层次结构。

Method: 采用SAEs作为解释工具，分析DINOv2模型的激活表示。

Result: SAEs揭示了模型中隐含的分类层次关系，并分析了DINOv2不同层的一致性。

Conclusion: 研究为视觉模型的层次分析提供了框架，展示了SAEs在探究深度网络语义结构中的潜力。

Abstract: The ImageNet hierarchy provides a structured taxonomy of object categories,
offering a valuable lens through which to analyze the representations learned
by deep vision models. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of how
vision models encode the ImageNet hierarchy, leveraging Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to probe their internal representations. SAEs have been widely used as
an explanation tool for large language models (LLMs), where they enable the
discovery of semantically meaningful features. Here, we extend their use to
vision models to investigate whether learned representations align with the
ontological structure defined by the ImageNet taxonomy. Our results show that
SAEs uncover hierarchical relationships in model activations, revealing an
implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these
representations across different layers of the popular vision foundation model
DINOv2 and provide insights into how deep vision models internalize
hierarchical category information by increasing information in the class token
through each layer. Our study establishes a framework for systematic
hierarchical analysis of vision model representations and highlights the
potential of SAEs as a tool for probing semantic structure in deep networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Redemption Score是一个新颖的混合评分框架，用于评估图像标题，通过结合三种互补信号提供更全面的评估。

Motivation: 现有的大多数指标未能完全捕捉图像标题的视觉语义和语言语用学评估的结合需求。

Method: 引入Redemption Score框架，通过结合Mutual Information Divergence（MID）、DINO-based perceptual similarity和BERTScore三种信号。

Result: 在Flickr8k基准测试中，Redemption Score的Kendall-τ为56.43，优于十二种先前方法。

Conclusion: Redemption Score能更稳健且细致地评估图像语义和语言可解释性，展示了优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Evaluating image captions requires cohesive assessment of both visual
semantics and language pragmatics, which is often not entirely captured by most
metrics. We introduce Redemption Score, a novel hybrid framework that ranks
image captions by triangulating three complementary signals: (1) Mutual
Information Divergence (MID) for global image-text distributional alignment,
(2) DINO-based perceptual similarity of cycle-generated images for visual
grounding, and (3) BERTScore for contextual text similarity against human
references. A calibrated fusion of these signals allows Redemption Score to
offer a more holistic assessment. On the Flickr8k benchmark, Redemption Score
achieves a Kendall-$\tau$ of 56.43, outperforming twelve prior methods and
demonstrating superior correlation with human judgments without requiring
task-specific training. Our framework provides a more robust and nuanced
evaluation by effectively redeeming image semantics and linguistic
interpretability indicated by strong transfer of knowledge in the Conceptual
Captions and MS COCO datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Circle-RoPE方法，通过Per-Token Distance（PTD）度量跨模态位置编码独立性，改进RoPE在大视觉语言模型中的位置偏差问题。

Motivation: 解决Rotary Position Embedding（RoPE）在大视觉语言模型（LVLM）中引入的跨模态位置偏差问题。

Method: 提出PTD度量标准，设计Circle-RoPE编码方案，将图像token索引映射到与文本token正交的圆形轨迹上，并采用分层策略结合不同RoPE变体。

Result: 实验证明Circle-RoPE能有效保留图像空间信息并减少位置偏差。

Conclusion: Circle-RoPE为LVLM提供了更鲁棒和灵活的位置编码框架。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding
relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when
extended to large vision-language models (LVLMs), its variants introduce
unintended cross-modal positional biases. Specifically, they enforce relative
positional dependencies between text token indices and image tokens, causing
spurious alignments. This issue arises because image tokens representing the
same content but located at different spatial positions are assigned distinct
positional biases, leading to inconsistent cross-modal associations. To address
this, we propose Per-Token Distance (PTD) - a simple yet effective metric for
quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities.
Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme
that maps image token indices onto a circular trajectory orthogonal to the
linear path of text token indices, forming a cone-like structure. This
configuration ensures that each text token maintains an equal distance to all
image tokens, reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving
intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a
staggered layer strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers.
This design leverages the complementary strengths of each RoPE variant, thereby
enhancing the model's overall performance. Our experimental results demonstrate
that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while
reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible
positional encoding framework for LVLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: The learning mechanisms by which humans acquire internal representations of
objects are not fully understood. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a
useful tool for investigating this question, as they have internal
representations similar to those of humans as a byproduct of optimizing their
objective functions. While previous studies have shown that models trained with
various learning paradigms - such as supervised, self-supervised, and CLIP -
acquire human-like representations, it remains unclear whether their similarity
to human representations is primarily at a coarse category level or extends to
finer details. Here, we employ an unsupervised alignment method based on
Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport to compare human and model object
representations at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. The unique
feature of this method compared to conventional representational similarity
analysis is that it estimates optimal fine-grained mappings between the
representation of each object in human and model representations. We used this
unsupervised alignment method to assess the extent to which the representation
of each object in humans is correctly mapped to the corresponding
representation of the same object in models. Using human similarity judgments
of 1,854 objects from the THINGS dataset, we find that models trained with CLIP
consistently achieve strong fine- and coarse-grained matching with human object
representations. In contrast, self-supervised models showed limited matching at
both fine- and coarse-grained levels, but still formed object clusters that
reflected human coarse category structure. Our results offer new insights into
the role of linguistic information in acquiring precise object representations
and the potential of self-supervised learning to capture coarse categorical
structures.

Conclusion: 该模型能够高效、准确地联合评估心脏功能，为心血管疾病的预后评估提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for
the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most
commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors
such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load
conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac
dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart
failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a
relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility
is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with
myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac
function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from
cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain
calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential
frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are
often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac
function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and
segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep
GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view
cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with
conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that
the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation
time.

Motivation: 探索如何利用放射学报告增强VQA模型性能，特别是在单图像和图像差异问题上的应用。

Method: 采用统一方法处理两种问题类型，并分两步：报告生成和答案生成，利用预测的放射学报告作为额外输入。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 整合放射学报告显著提升了VQA模型的表现。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to Chest X-ray (CXR) Visual Question Answering
(VQA), addressing both single-image image-difference questions. Single-image
questions focus on abnormalities within a specific CXR ("What abnormalities are
seen in image X?"), while image-difference questions compare two longitudinal
CXRs acquired at different time points ("What are the differences between image
X and Y?"). We further explore how the integration of radiology reports can
enhance the performance of VQA models. While previous approaches have
demonstrated the utility of radiology reports during the pre-training phase, we
extend this idea by showing that the reports can also be leveraged as
additional input to improve the VQA model's predicted answers. First, we
propose a unified method that handles both types of questions and
auto-regressively generates the answers. For single-image questions, the model
is provided with a single CXR. For image-difference questions, the model is
provided with two CXRs from the same patient, captured at different time
points, enabling the model to detect and describe temporal changes. Taking
inspiration from 'Chain-of-Thought reasoning', we demonstrate that performance
on the CXR VQA task can be improved by grounding the answer generator module
with a radiology report predicted for the same CXR. In our approach, the VQA
model is divided into two steps: i) Report Generation (RG) and ii) Answer
Generation (AG). Our results demonstrate that incorporating predicted radiology
reports as evidence to the AG model enhances performance on both single-image
and image-difference questions, achieving state-of-the-art results on the
Medical-Diff-VQA dataset.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to incentivize the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) and develop an
effective approach that mitigates the sparse reward and advantage vanishing
issues during RL. To this end, we propose Share-GRPO, a novel RL approach that
tackle these issues by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning trajectories
over expanded question space. Specifically, Share-GRPO first expands the
question space for a given question via data transformation techniques, and
then encourages MLLM to effectively explore diverse reasoning trajectories over
the expanded question space and shares the discovered reasoning trajectories
across the expanded questions during RL. In addition, Share-GRPO also shares
reward information during advantage computation, which estimates solution
advantages hierarchically across and within question variants, allowing more
accurate estimation of relative advantages and improving the stability of
policy training. Extensive evaluations over six widely-used reasoning
benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method. Code will be

Result: 伪造视频的混淆率达68%，DigiShield在DigiFakeAV和DF-TIMIT数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DigiShield通过细粒度分析有效识别伪造视频，为深度伪造检测提供新基准。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid development of deepfake technology has given rise
to an emerging and serious threat to public security: diffusion model-based
digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such
models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency through multimodal
control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to
existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the
first large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion
models. Employing five latest digital human generation methods (Sonic, Hallo,
etc.) and voice cloning method, we systematically produce a dataset comprising
60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin
tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data
diversity and realism. User studies show that the confusion rate between forged
and real videos reaches 68%, and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detection
models exhibit large drops in AUC values on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the
challenge of the dataset. To address this problem, we further propose
DigiShield, a detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal
fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the
semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves SOTA performance on
both the DigiFakeAV and DF-TIMIT datasets. Experiments show that this method
effectively identifies covert artifacts through fine-grained analysis of the
temporal evolution of facial features in synthetic videos.

Motivation: SAM模型在语义分割任务中偏向于形状而非纹理，但在医学影像、材料分类等领域纹理至关重要。

Method: 采用纹理增强技术和新的纹理变化ADE20K数据集进行微调，以强调纹理特征。

Result: TextureSAM在自然和合成的纹理分割数据集上分别比SAM-2提高了0.2 mIoU和0.18 mIoU。

Conclusion: TextureSAM有效减轻了SAM模型的形状偏见，提升了纹理场景的分割性能。

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) have achieved remarkable success in object
segmentation tasks across diverse datasets. However, these models are
predominantly trained on large-scale semantic segmentation datasets, which
introduce a bias toward object shape rather than texture cues in the image.
This limitation is critical in domains such as medical imaging, material
classification, and remote sensing, where texture changes define object
boundaries. In this study, we investigate SAM's bias toward semantics over
textures and introduce a new texture-aware foundation model, TextureSAM, which
performs superior segmentation in texture-dominant scenarios. To achieve this,
we employ a novel fine-tuning approach that incorporates texture augmentation
techniques, incrementally modifying training images to emphasize texture
features. By leveraging a novel texture-alternation of the ADE20K dataset, we
guide TextureSAM to prioritize texture-defined regions, thereby mitigating the
inherent shape bias present in the original SAM model. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that TextureSAM significantly outperforms SAM-2 on both
natural (+0.2 mIoU) and synthetic (+0.18 mIoU) texture-based segmentation
datasets. The code and texture-augmented dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: Auto-nnU-Net通过AutoML技术优化了医学图像分割的性能，解决了资源受限的实际问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ
segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation
model. The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many
aspects of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters
and heuristic design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose
Auto-nnU-Net, a novel nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization
(HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS).
Additionally, we propose Regularized PriorBand to balance model accuracy with
the computational resources required for training, addressing the resource
constraints often faced in real-world medical settings that limit the
feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate our approach across
diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation Decathlon,
analyzing the impact of AutoML techniques on segmentation performance,
computational efficiency, and model design choices. The results demonstrate
that our AutoML approach substantially improves the segmentation performance of
nnU-Net on 6 out of 10 datasets and is on par on the other datasets while
maintaining practical resource requirements. Our code is available at

Motivation: 针对黑盒环境中目标类别的对抗攻击挑战，现有方法主要依赖决策边界的几何特性，而忽略了图像本身的信息。

Method: 提出TEA方法，通过利用目标图像的边缘信息，生成更接近源图像的对抗样本。

Result: TEA在低查询设置中优于现有方法，查询次数减少近70%，并能有效优化几何攻击的初始化。

Conclusion: TEA显著提升了对抗攻击的效率和实用性，尤其在现实应用的受限查询场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to
adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce
misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is
accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific
target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions.
Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the
decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than
incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose
Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge
information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an
adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the
desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly
70\% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world
applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by
efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved
target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

TL;DR: 介绍了首个专注于多图像推理的医学VQA基准MedFrameQA，通过自动化和人工筛选构建高质量数据集，评估了多种先进多模态模型，结果显示模型表现普遍较差，并揭示了常见错误类型。

Motivation: 现有医学VQA基准多关注单图像分析，而临床诊断通常需要多图像对比，因此提出MedFrameQA以填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了自动化流程提取时间连贯的医学视频帧，并通过多阶段筛选策略构建高质量VQA数据集。

Result: 数据集包含2,851个VQA对，评估显示所有模型表现不佳，多数准确率低于50%，且存在忽略关键信息、跨图像证据误解等问题。

Conclusion: MedFrameQA为多图像推理研究提供了基准，推动更具临床诊断能力的AI系统发展。

Abstract: Existing medical VQA benchmarks mostly focus on single-image analysis, yet
clinicians almost always compare a series of images before reaching a
diagnosis. To better approximate this workflow, we introduce MedFrameQA -- the
first benchmark that explicitly evaluates multi-image reasoning in medical VQA.
To build MedFrameQA both at scale and in high-quality, we develop 1) an
automated pipeline that extracts temporally coherent frames from medical videos
and constructs VQA items whose content evolves logically across images, and 2)
a multiple-stage filtering strategy, including model-based and manual review,
to preserve data clarity, difficulty, and medical relevance. The resulting
dataset comprises 2,851 VQA pairs (gathered from 9,237 high-quality frames in
3,420 videos), covering nine human body systems and 43 organs; every question
is accompanied by two to five images. We comprehensively benchmark ten advanced
Multimodal LLMs -- both proprietary and open source, with and without explicit
reasoning modules -- on MedFrameQA. The evaluation challengingly reveals that
all models perform poorly, with most accuracies below 50%, and accuracy
fluctuates as the number of images per question increases. Error analysis
further shows that models frequently ignore salient findings, mis-aggregate
evidence across images, and propagate early mistakes through their reasoning
chains; results also vary substantially across body systems, organs, and
modalities. We hope this work can catalyze research on clinically grounded,
multi-image reasoning and accelerate progress toward more capable diagnostic AI
systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（CACTI和CACTIF），利用扩散模型改善合成数据训练的语义分割模型在真实场景中的表现。

Motivation: 解决合成数据训练的模型在真实场景中因域差距表现不佳的问题，尤其是在数据稀缺的恶劣条件下。

Method: 提出类自适应的实例归一化与交叉注意力（CACTI）及其扩展版本带选择性注意力过滤的CACTIF，实现语义一致的风格迁移。

Result: 实验表明，GTA5到Cityscapes/ACDC的风格迁移生成图像质量更高，FID分数更低，语义边界保留更好。

Conclusion: 类感知的扩散风格迁移即使目标域数据极少也能有效缩小合成与真实域的差距。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly
on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions
where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate
realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such
diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on
synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent
style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance
Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective
attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization
selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters
cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in
regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style
characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence,
unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without
constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target
domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID
scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware
diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain
gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems
for challenging real-world applications. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIN是一种任务无关的注意力引导策略，通过选择性抑制低图像注意力头，减少大型视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题且不影响性能。

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成文本时经常出现与视觉上下文不符的'幻觉'，现有方法在减少幻觉时会增加延迟。

Method: 提出SPIN策略，动态抑制与图像注意力低的注意力头，同时保留高注意力头。

Result: 在视觉问答和图像描述任务中，SPIN将幻觉分数降低最高2.7倍，吞吐量提升1.8倍。

Conclusion: SPIN通过选择性抑制注意力头有效减少幻觉，且无显著计算或延迟开销。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large
vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating
texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing
hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase
in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided
head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference,
without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate
whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our
analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of
attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query
token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to
image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations
on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the
efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining
F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）多帧空间理解的框架，通过整合深度感知、视觉对应和动态感知，提升了机器人和实际应用中的多帧推理能力。

Motivation: 现有的MLLMs在视觉任务中表现优异，但其空间理解限于单幅图像，无法满足需要多帧推理的实际应用需求。

Method: 设计了MultiSPA数据集，包含2700多万个样本，涵盖多样化的3D和4D场景，并提出了一个全面的基准测试。模型Multi-SpatialMLLM整合了深度感知、视觉对应和动态感知。

Conclusion: 该方法为MLLMs的多帧空间理解提供了有效解决方案，并为机器人应用中的多帧奖励标注提供了可能。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced in visual
tasks, yet their spatial understanding remains limited to single images,
leaving them ill-suited for robotics and other real-world applications that
require multi-frame reasoning. In this paper, we propose a framework to equip
MLLMs with robust multi-frame spatial understanding by integrating depth
perception, visual correspondence, and dynamic perception. Central to our
approach is the MultiSPA dataset, a novel, large-scale collection of more than
27 million samples spanning diverse 3D and 4D scenes. Alongside MultiSPA, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that tests a wide spectrum of spatial tasks
under uniform metrics. Our resulting model, Multi-SpatialMLLM, achieves
significant gains over baselines and proprietary systems, demonstrating
scalable, generalizable multi-frame reasoning. We further observe multi-task
benefits and early indications of emergent capabilities in challenging
scenarios, and showcase how our model can serve as a multi-frame reward
annotator for robotics.

TL;DR: VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) 是首个针对视频大型语言模型安全性的多样化基准测试，揭示了视频模态会降低安全性42.3%。提出的 VideoSafety-R1 框架通过双重创新显著提升了安全性。

Motivation: 尽管基于图像的大型语言模型的安全性已被广泛研究，但基于视频的模型（Video LLMs）的安全性仍未被充分探究。

Method: 提出了 VideoSafety-R1 框架，包括 Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) 和 Safety-Guided GRPO，通过双重创新显著提升了安全性。

Result: VideoSafety-R1 在 VSB-Eval-HH 上实现了65.1%的提升，并在其他数据集上也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过主动推理和多模态验证，VideoSafety-R1 显著提升了视频语言模型的安全性。

Abstract: While the safety risks of image-based large language models have been
extensively studied, their video-based counterparts (Video LLMs) remain
critically under-examined. To systematically study this problem, we introduce
\textbf{VideoSafetyBench (VSB-77k) - the first large-scale, culturally diverse
benchmark for Video LLM safety}, which compromises 77,646 video-query pairs and
spans 19 principal risk categories across 10 language communities. \textit{We
reveal that integrating video modality degrades safety performance by an
average of 42.3\%, exposing systemic risks in multimodal attack exploitation.}
To address this vulnerability, we propose \textbf{VideoSafety-R1}, a dual-stage
framework achieving unprecedented safety gains through two innovations: (1)
Alarm Token-Guided Safety Fine-Tuning (AT-SFT) injects learnable alarm tokens
into visual and textual sequences, enabling explicit harm perception across
modalities via multitask objectives. (2) Then, Safety-Guided GRPO enhances
defensive reasoning through dynamic policy optimization with rule-based rewards
derived from dual-modality verification. These components synergize to shift
safety alignment from passive harm recognition to active reasoning. The
resulting framework achieves a 65.1\% improvement on VSB-Eval-HH, and improves
by 59.1\%, 44.3\%, and 15.0\% on the image safety datasets MMBench, VLGuard,
and FigStep, respectively. \textit{Our codes are available in the supplementary

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面研究了GRPO和DPO算法在自回归图像生成中的应用，分析了不同奖励模型对算法能力的影响，并提出了提升其性能的扩展策略。

Motivation: 近年来，强化学习（RL）在提升大语言模型（CoT推理）能力方面发挥了重要作用，但在自回归图像生成领域的应用仍缺乏深入分析，尤其是针对不同RL策略和领域特定挑战的研究。

Method: 本文研究了GRPO和DPO算法在自回归图像生成中的应用，评估了它们的领域内表现和跨领域泛化能力，并探讨了不同奖励模型对其性能的影响。同时，系统性地研究了三种常见的扩展策略。

Conclusion: 本文为自回归图像生成中开发更有效的RL算法以实现稳健的CoT推理提供了新思路，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central
to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image
generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents
unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass
ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and
designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler
rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these
explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific
challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this
gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO
algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain
performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of
different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal
that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward
models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially
enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore,
we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both
their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into
efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a
new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms
to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image
generation. Code is released at

Motivation: 评估指令微调的VLMs是否能同时改善医学图像的多任务处理，从而提升临床诊断的效率和准确性。

Method: 使用MedMultiPoints数据集将任务转换为适合视觉语言推理的指令提示，并通过LoRA技术微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 多任务训练提高了模型的鲁棒性和准确性，如减少计数MAE并增加匹配准确率，但在边缘案例中可靠性有所下降。

Conclusion: 通过提示驱动的微调，通用VLMs可适应专业医学任务，为可解释和多功能医学AI提供了方向。

Abstract: We investigate fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-task
medical image understanding, focusing on detection, localization, and counting
of findings in medical images. Our objective is to evaluate whether
instruction-tuned VLMs can simultaneously improve these tasks, with the goal of
enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Using MedMultiPoints, a
multimodal dataset with annotations from endoscopy (polyps and instruments) and
microscopy (sperm cells), we reformulate each task into instruction-based
prompts suitable for vision-language reasoning. We fine-tune
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) across multiple task
combinations. Results show that multi-task training improves robustness and
accuracy. For example, it reduces the Count Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and
increases Matching Accuracy in the Counting + Pointing task. However,
trade-offs emerge, such as more zero-case point predictions, indicating reduced
reliability in edge cases despite overall performance gains. Our study
highlights the potential of adapting general-purpose VLMs to specialized
medical tasks via prompt-driven fine-tuning. This approach mirrors clinical
workflows, where radiologists simultaneously localize, count, and describe
findings - demonstrating how VLMs can learn composite diagnostic reasoning
patterns. The model produces interpretable, structured outputs, offering a
promising step toward explainable and versatile medical AI. Code, model

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为排名熵最小化的方法，以解决熵最小化在持续测试时适应性中导致的模型崩溃问题，通过渐进掩码策略提高稳定性。

Motivation: 熵最小化在测试时适应性中表现高效，但在持续性场景中容易引发模型崩溃（预测单一类别），因此需要改进其稳定性。

Method: 采用排名熵最小化方法，通过渐进掩码策略逐步对齐模型对不同预测难度概率分布的预测，同时保持熵的排名顺序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了该方法的有效性，表现出更好的稳定性。

Conclusion: 排名熵最小化方法显著改善了熵最小化在持续性测试时适应性中的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to adapt to realistic environments in an online
manner by learning during test time. Entropy minimization has emerged as a
principal strategy for test-time adaptation due to its efficiency and
adaptability. Nevertheless, it remains underexplored in continual test-time
adaptation, where stability is more important. We observe that the entropy
minimization method often suffers from model collapse, where the model
converges to predicting a single class for all images due to a trivial
solution. We propose ranked entropy minimization to mitigate the stability
problem of the entropy minimization method and extend its applicability to
continuous scenarios. Our approach explicitly structures the prediction
difficulty through a progressive masking strategy. Specifically, it gradually
aligns the model's probability distributions across different levels of
prediction difficulty while preserving the rank order of entropy. The proposed
method is extensively evaluated across various benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through empirical results. Our code is available at

Conclusion: GoT-R1通过在视觉生成领域引入复杂推理能力，推动了图像生成的先进水平。

Abstract: Visual generation models have made remarkable progress in creating realistic
images from text prompts, yet struggle with complex prompts that specify
multiple objects with precise spatial relationships and attributes. Effective
handling of such prompts requires explicit reasoning about the semantic content
and spatial layout. We present GoT-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement
learning to enhance semantic-spatial reasoning in visual generation. Building
upon the Generation Chain-of-Thought approach, GoT-R1 enables models to
autonomously discover effective reasoning strategies beyond predefined
templates through carefully designed reinforcement learning. To achieve this,
we propose a dual-stage multi-dimensional reward framework that leverages MLLMs
to evaluate both the reasoning process and final output, enabling effective
supervision across the entire generation pipeline. The reward system assesses
semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality in a unified approach.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on T2I-CompBench
benchmark, particularly in compositional tasks involving precise spatial
relationships and attribute binding. GoT-R1 advances the state-of-the-art in
image generation by successfully transferring sophisticated reasoning
capabilities to the visual generation domain. To facilitate future research, we
make our code and pretrained models publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了基于锚点的高效视觉变换器（AnchorFormer），通过减少计算复杂度和聚焦关键信息，显著提升了视觉任务性能。

Motivation: 由于ViTs在计算全局自注意力时存在二次复杂度高和冗余令牌的问题，需要一种更高效的模型来处理这些挑战。

Method: 引入锚点令牌学习关键信息，通过双分注意力将复杂度从O(n²)降至O(mn)，并利用可微学习近似全局自注意力。

Result: 在分类、检测和分割任务中表现卓越，例如在ImageNet分类上精度提升9.0%或减少46.7% FLOPs，COCO检测中mAP提高81.3%。

Conclusion: AnchorFormer通过锚点机制高效地捕捉关键信息，显著提升了计算效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance on
vision tasks by measuring the global self-attention among the image patches.
Given $n$ patches, they will have quadratic complexity such as
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and the time cost is high when splitting the input image
with a small granularity. Meanwhile, the pivotal information is often randomly
gathered in a few regions of an input image, some tokens may not be helpful for
the downstream tasks. To handle this problem, we introduce an anchor-based
efficient vision transformer (AnchorFormer), which employs the anchor tokens to
learn the pivotal information and accelerate the inference. Firstly, by
estimating the bipartite attention between the anchors and tokens, the
complexity will be reduced from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$, where
$m$ is an anchor number and $m < n$. Notably, by representing the anchors with
the neurons in a neural layer, we can differentiable learn these distributions
and approximate global self-attention through the Markov process. Moreover, we
extend the proposed model to three downstream tasks including classification,
detection, and segmentation. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of
our AnchorFormer, e.g., achieving up to a 9.0% higher accuracy or 46.7% FLOPs
reduction on ImageNet classification, 81.3% higher mAP on COCO detection under
comparable FLOPs, as compared to the current baselines.

Abstract: Maintaining robust 3D perception under dynamic and unpredictable test-time
conditions remains a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems.
Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks
like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While
recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer
improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are
computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple
forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and
scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating
in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents
each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source
model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute
merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints,
enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality.
Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving
end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by
over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as
online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training. Code and
pretrained models are released in the supplementary material.

Abstract: Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years,
especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While
many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as
temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how
models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature
extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We
propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the
temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based
system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion
from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our
findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only
front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions,
specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to
improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In
conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based
caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively
addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current
state-of-the-art model architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语义的3D对象压缩方法，通过忽略结构信息并使用自然语言作为存储格式，实现了高达105倍的压缩率，超越了传统方法。

Motivation: 传统3D对象压缩方法在高压缩率下表现不佳，而语义压缩通过直接操作核心概念并提供自然语言存储格式，更适合于大规模协作项目。

Method: 构建了一个基于公共生成模型的3D语义压缩管道，利用先进的深度生成模型预测缺失信息。

Result: 在Objaverse数据集上实现了高达105倍的压缩率，且在高压缩率下质量优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 语义压缩在高压缩率下表现出色，为增强和虚拟现实中的大规模协作项目提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional methods for 3D object compression operate only on structural
information within the object vertices, polygons, and textures. These methods
are effective at compression rates up to 10x for standard object sizes but
quickly deteriorate at higher compression rates with texture artifacts,
low-polygon counts, and mesh gaps. In contrast, semantic compression ignores
structural information and operates directly on the core concepts to push to
extreme levels of compression. In addition, it uses natural language as its
storage format, which makes it natively human-readable and a natural fit for
emerging applications built around large-scale, collaborative projects within
augmented and virtual reality. It deprioritizes structural information like
location, size, and orientation and predicts the missing information with
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In this work, we construct a pipeline
for 3D semantic compression from public generative models and explore the
quality-compression frontier for 3D object compression. We apply this pipeline
to achieve rates as high as 105x for 3D objects taken from the Objaverse
dataset and show that semantic compression can outperform traditional methods
in the important quality-preserving region around 100x compression.

Result: FarSight在图像和视频基准测试中有效减少了幻觉现象，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过优化令牌传播和注意力分配，FarSight成功缓解了多模态模型中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However, they
often suffer from hallucinations. In this work, hallucinations are categorized
into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We
argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the
token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in the decoding
strategy, we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information
propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient
interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens,
overlooking dense and rich contextual cues. Therefore, we propose to intervene
in the propagation process by tackling outlier tokens to enhance in-context
inference. With this goal, we present FarSight, a versatile plug-and-play
decoding strategy to reduce attention interference from outlier tokens merely
by optimizing the causal mask. The heart of our method is effective token
propagation. We design an attention register structure within the upper
triangular matrix of the causal mask, dynamically allocating attention to
capture attention diverted to outlier tokens. Moreover, a positional awareness
encoding method with a diminishing masking rate is proposed, allowing the model
to attend to further preceding tokens, especially for video sequence tasks.
With extensive experiments, FarSight demonstrates significant
hallucination-mitigating performance across different MLLMs on both image and
video benchmarks, proving its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用共形预测为基于视觉的着陆系统（VLS）提供跑道检测的统计不确定性保证，并提出了新指标C-mAP。

Motivation: 为了提高跑道检测的可靠性，为航空航天领域中ML系统的认证提供支持。

Abstract: We explore the use of conformal prediction to provide statistical uncertainty
guarantees for runway detection in vision-based landing systems (VLS). Using
fine-tuned YOLOv5 and YOLOv6 models on aerial imagery, we apply conformal
prediction to quantify localization reliability under user-defined risk levels.
We also introduce Conformal mean Average Precision (C-mAP), a novel metric
aligning object detection performance with conformal guarantees. Our results
show that conformal prediction can improve the reliability of runway detection
by quantifying uncertainty in a statistically sound way, increasing safety
on-board and paving the way for certification of ML system in the aerospace

TL;DR: 本文提出了T2I-ConBench，一个用于文本到图像模型持续后训练的基准测试，解决了缺乏标准化评估协议的问题，并通过实验发现现有方法无法在所有任务上表现优异。

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的持续后训练缺乏统一的评估协议，导致研究进展受限。

Method: 提出T2I-ConBench基准，涵盖两种实际场景（项定制和域增强）和四个评估维度（泛化保留、目标任务性能、灾难性遗忘和跨任务泛化）。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在四个维度上均表现不佳，跨任务泛化问题仍未解决。

Conclusion: T2I-ConBench为文本到图像模型的持续后训练研究提供了标准化评估工具，并揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Continual post-training adapts a single text-to-image diffusion model to
learn new tasks without incurring the cost of separate models, but naive
post-training causes forgetting of pretrained knowledge and undermines
zero-shot compositionality. We observe that the absence of a standardized
evaluation protocol hampers related research for continual post-training. To
address this, we introduce T2I-ConBench, a unified benchmark for continual
post-training of text-to-image models. T2I-ConBench focuses on two practical
scenarios, item customization and domain enhancement, and analyzes four
dimensions: (1) retention of generality, (2) target-task performance, (3)
catastrophic forgetting, and (4) cross-task generalization. It combines
automated metrics, human-preference modeling, and vision-language QA for
comprehensive assessment. We benchmark ten representative methods across three
realistic task sequences and find that no approach excels on all fronts. Even
joint "oracle" training does not succeed for every task, and cross-task
generalization remains unsolved. We release all datasets, code, and evaluation
tools to accelerate research in continual post-training for text-to-image
models.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种无监督学习框架，用于提取皮肤病学特征，并与基于ImageNet的预训练模型进行比较，结果显示自监督学习具有更好的泛化能力和适应性。

Motivation: 解决深度学习在医学影像中对大型标记数据集和计算资源的依赖，以及自然图像预训练模型可能无法捕捉医学领域特性的问题。

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）在皮肤病数据集上进行无监督训练，构建结构化且临床相关的潜在空间，并与ImageNet预训练模型进行比较。

Result: 自监督模型的验证损失降低33.33%，精准度提高44.44%，且过拟合更少；ImageNet预训练模型虽收敛快但过拟合明显。

Conclusion: 自监督学习在医学影像中表现更优，强调了领域特定特征提取的重要性。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision but relies heavily on large
labeled datasets and computational resources. Transfer learning, particularly
fine-tuning pretrained models, offers a practical alternative; however, models
pretrained on natural image datasets such as ImageNet may fail to capture
domain-specific characteristics in medical imaging. This study introduces an
unsupervised learning framework that extracts high-value dermatological
features instead of relying solely on ImageNet-based pretraining. We employ a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained from scratch on a proprietary
dermatological dataset, allowing the model to learn a structured and clinically
relevant latent space. This self-supervised feature extractor is then compared
to an ImageNet-pretrained backbone under identical classification conditions,
highlighting the trade-offs between general-purpose and domain-specific
pretraining. Our results reveal distinct learning patterns. The self-supervised
model achieves a final validation loss of 0.110 (-33.33%), while the
ImageNet-pretrained model stagnates at 0.100 (-16.67%), indicating overfitting.
Accuracy trends confirm this: the self-supervised model improves from 45% to
65% (+44.44%) with a near-zero overfitting gap, whereas the ImageNet-pretrained
model reaches 87% (+50.00%) but plateaus at 75% (+19.05%), with its overfitting
gap increasing to +0.060. These findings suggest that while ImageNet
pretraining accelerates convergence, it also amplifies overfitting on
non-clinically relevant features. In contrast, self-supervised learning
achieves steady improvements, stronger generalization, and superior
adaptability, underscoring the importance of domain-specific feature extraction
in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HASTE通过两阶段训练加速Diffusion Transformer的训练，早期通过对齐教师模型的注意力图和特征提高收敛速度，后期终止对齐以释放生成能力，显著减少训练步骤。

Motivation: 现有方法REPA在早期加速DiT训练但后期性能下降，原因在于教师模型的低维嵌入限制了生成能力。

Method: HASTE采用两阶段策略：第一阶段通过全息对齐损失同时蒸馏注意力图和特征；第二阶段触发终止对齐损失，专注于去噪。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，HASTE仅用50个周期达到基线FID，500周期匹配REPA的最佳FID，优化步骤减少28倍。

Conclusion: HASTE是一种简单有效的方法，适用于多种扩散任务。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art image quality, yet
their training remains notoriously slow. A recent remedy -- representation
alignment (REPA) that matches DiT hidden features to those of a non-generative
teacher (e.g. DINO) -- dramatically accelerates the early epochs but plateaus
or even degrades performance later. We trace this failure to a capacity
mismatch: once the generative student begins modelling the joint data
distribution, the teacher's lower-dimensional embeddings and attention patterns
become a straitjacket rather than a guide. We then introduce HASTE (Holistic
Alignment with Stage-wise Termination for Efficient training), a two-phase
schedule that keeps the help and drops the hindrance. Phase I applies a
holistic alignment loss that simultaneously distills attention maps (relational
priors) and feature projections (semantic anchors) from the teacher into
mid-level layers of the DiT, yielding rapid convergence. Phase II then performs
one-shot termination that deactivates the alignment loss, once a simple trigger
such as a fixed iteration is hit, freeing the DiT to focus on denoising and
exploit its generative capacity. HASTE speeds up training of diverse DiTs
without architecture changes. On ImageNet 256X256, it reaches the vanilla
SiT-XL/2 baseline FID in 50 epochs and matches REPA's best FID in 500 epochs,
amounting to a 28X reduction in optimization steps. HASTE also improves
text-to-image DiTs on MS-COCO, demonstrating to be a simple yet principled
recipe for efficient diffusion training across various tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/HASTE .

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更高效的全局相关性卷及采样方法，显著降低了计算和内存消耗，同时保持准确性和效率。

Motivation: 当前光流估计方法采用密集全对相关性卷及局部成本采样，导致计算和内存消耗呈平方增长，现有方法通常只能处理低分辨率图像，丢失细节。

Method: 提出了一种更高效的全局相关性卷及采样实现，与RAFT定义的精确数学操作符匹配，同时降低内存使用。

Result: 该方法比按需采样快90%，内存使用降低95%，整体模型推理时间节省50%，在高分辨率数据集上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: 该方法在内存受限环境中实现了高效且准确的全局相关性卷及采样，适用于高分辨率光流估计。

Abstract: Recent optical flow estimation methods often employ local cost sampling from
a dense all-pairs correlation volume. This results in quadratic computational
and memory complexity in the number of pixels. Although an alternative
memory-efficient implementation with on-demand cost computation exists, this is
slower in practice and therefore prior methods typically process images at
reduced resolutions, missing fine-grained details.
  To address this, we propose a more efficient implementation of the all-pairs
correlation volume sampling, still matching the exact mathematical operator as
defined by RAFT. Our approach outperforms on-demand sampling by up to 90% while
maintaining low memory usage, and performs on par with the default
implementation with up to 95% lower memory usage. As cost sampling makes up a
significant portion of the overall runtime, this can translate to up to 50%
savings for the total end-to-end model inference in memory-constrained
environments. Our evaluation of existing methods includes an 8K
ultra-high-resolution dataset and an additional inference-time modification of
the recent SEA-RAFT method. With this, we achieve state-of-the-art results at
high resolutions both in accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FakeVV数据集和Fact-R1框架，用于解决视频虚假信息检测中的数据集缺乏和深度推理不足问题。

Motivation: 社交媒体上多模态虚假信息的快速传播引发了广泛关注，但现有方法因数据集不足和缺乏深度推理而受限。

Method: 构建了包含10万个视频-文本对的FakeVV数据集，并提出结合深度推理与协作规则强化学习的Fact-R1框架，分为三阶段训练。

Result: Fact-R1在多模态虚假信息检测中表现出与先进文本强化学习系统相当的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为虚假信息检测建立了新范式，结合大规模视频理解、推理引导对齐和可解释验证。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised
growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains
limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods
often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive
content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale
benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained,
interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel
framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based
reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1)
misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference
alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This
enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those
observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more
complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm
for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding,
reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种简单快速的Feature Mixing方法，用于多模态异常合成，以改善模型对分布外（OOD）数据的检测，并在多个数据集上取得了最优性能。

Motivation: 在安全关键应用中（如自动驾驶），OOD检测和分割至关重要，但现有研究主要关注单模态图像数据，而现实应用是多模态的。缺乏未知数据的监督信号导致模型对OOD样本过于自信。

Method: 提出Feature Mixing方法，通过多模态异常合成优化模型对分布内（ID）和OOD数据的区分能力。该方法与模态无关，适用于多种模态组合。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes、CARLA-OOD等数据集上，Feature Mixing实现了最先进的性能，速度提升10倍至370倍。

Conclusion: Feature Mixing是一种高效的多模态OOD检测方法，适用于现实应用。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and segmentation are crucial for
deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as
autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. While prior research has
primarily focused on unimodal image data, real-world applications are
inherently multimodal, requiring the integration of multiple modalities for
improved OOD detection. A key challenge is the lack of supervision signals from
unknown data, leading to overconfident predictions on OOD samples. To address
this challenge, we propose Feature Mixing, an extremely simple and fast method
for multimodal outlier synthesis with theoretical support, which can be further
optimized to help the model better distinguish between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD data. Feature Mixing is modality-agnostic and applicable to various
modality combinations. Additionally, we introduce CARLA-OOD, a novel multimodal
dataset for OOD segmentation, featuring synthetic OOD objects across diverse
scenes and weather conditions. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI,
nuScenes, CARLA-OOD datasets, and the MultiOOD benchmark demonstrate that
Feature Mixing achieves state-of-the-art performance with a $10 \times$ to $370
\times$ speedup. Our source code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出了Native Segmentation Vision Transformer，通过内容感知的空间分组层动态分配标记，实现无需额外分割头层的原生分割方法。

Motivation: 传统下采样方法在视觉主干网络中占主导，但缺乏对图像边界和语义内容的动态适应性。

Method: 采用内容感知的空间分组层，动态分配标记到减少的集合中，实现层次化分割。

Result: 架构设计支持仅通过分组层生成强分割掩码，无需额外监督，实现了高效的下游分割任务设计。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的原生分割范式，支持零样本分割和高效模型设计。

Abstract: Uniform downsampling remains the de facto standard for reducing spatial
resolution in vision backbones. In this work, we propose an alternative design
built around a content-aware spatial grouping layer, that dynamically assigns
tokens to a reduced set based on image boundaries and their semantic content.
Stacking our grouping layer across consecutive backbone stages results in
hierarchical segmentation that arises natively in the feature extraction
process, resulting in our coined Native Segmentation Vision Transformer. We
show that a careful design of our architecture enables the emergence of strong
segmentation masks solely from grouping layers, that is, without additional
segmentation-specific heads. This sets the foundation for a new paradigm of
native, backbone-level segmentation, which enables strong zero-shot results
without mask supervision, as well as a minimal and efficient standalone model
design for downstream segmentation tasks. Our project page is

TL;DR: DetailMaster是一个专门评估文本到图像（T2I）模型处理复杂长文本提示能力的基准测试，揭示了当前模型在属性绑定和空间推理方面的局限性。

Motivation: 针对现有T2I模型在处理长文本和复杂细节提示时的性能下降问题，设计一个系统性评估基准以推动相关研究。

Method: 提出四个关键评估维度（角色属性、结构化角色位置、场景多维度属性、显式空间/交互关系），构建平均284.89个token的高质量长文本提示数据集，并评估了12个T2I模型。

Result: 实验显示，即使是先进模型在属性绑定和空间推理等关键维度上的准确率仅约50%，且随着提示长度增加性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: 当前模型在结构理解和细节处理方面存在系统性不足，需未来研究改进架构以增强组合推理能力。

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in
synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly
degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in
professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematical abilities
to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional
requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions:
Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene
Attributes, and Explicit Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark
comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high
quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5
long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations:
state-of-the-art models achieve merely ~50% accuracy in key dimensions like
attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive
performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis highlights
systemic failures in structural comprehension and detail overload handling,
motivating future research into architectures with enhanced compositional
reasoning. We open-source the dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools
to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable broad applications that would
otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

Abstract: We study the task of learning association between faces and voices, which is
gaining interest in the multimodal community lately. These methods suffer from
the deliberate crafting of negative mining procedures as well as the reliance
on the distant margin parameter. These issues are addressed by learning a joint
embedding space in which orthogonality constraints are applied to the fused
embeddings of faces and voices. However, embedding spaces of faces and voices
possess different characteristics and require spaces to be aligned before
fusing them. To this end, we propose a method that accurately aligns the
embedding spaces and fuses them with an enhanced gated fusion thereby improving
the performance of face-voice association. Extensive experiments on the
VoxCeleb dataset reveals the merits of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive success in

e.g., camera pose and motion estimation; (ii) we propose SpatialScore, the most
comprehensive and diverse multimodal spatial understanding benchmark to date,
integrating VGBench with relevant data from the other 11 existing datasets.
This benchmark comprises 28K samples across various spatial understanding
tasks, modalities, and QA formats, along with a carefully curated challenging

Abstract: Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI
interaction. Our project is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统单股学习方法无法利用股票间的关联性，限制了预测性能的提升。本文旨在通过整合跨股票的全局模式，弥补这一不足。

Conclusion: 提出的CSTI方法为股价预测提供了更高效的解决方案，优于传统单股学习方法。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is a critical area of financial forecasting,
traditionally approached by training models using the historical price data of
individual stocks. While these models effectively capture single-stock
patterns, they fail to leverage potential correlations among stock trends,
which could improve predictive performance. Current single-stock learning
methods are thus limited in their ability to provide a broader understanding of
price dynamics across multiple stocks. To address this, we propose a novel
method that merges local patterns into a global understanding through
cross-stock pattern integration. Our strategy is inspired by Federated Learning
(FL), a paradigm designed for decentralized model training. FL enables
collaborative learning across distributed datasets without sharing raw data,
facilitating the aggregation of global insights while preserving data privacy.
In our adaptation, we train models on individual stock data and iteratively
merge them to create a unified global model. This global model is subsequently
fine-tuned on specific stock data to retain local relevance. The proposed
strategy enables parallel training of individual stock models, facilitating
efficient utilization of computational resources and reducing overall training
time. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method,
demonstrating that it outperforms benchmark models and enhances the predictive
capabilities of state-of-the-art approaches. Our results highlight the efficacy
of Cross-Stock Trend Integration (CSTI) in advancing stock price prediction,
offering a robust alternative to traditional single-stock learning
methodologies.

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种计算语义分析方法，能够在科学与哲学的争议性问题中揭示跨学科的概念模式。

Abstract: The question of "what is life?" has challenged scientists and philosophers
for centuries, producing an array of definitions that reflect both the mystery
of its emergence and the diversity of disciplinary perspectives brought to bear
on the question. Despite significant progress in our understanding of
biological systems, psychology, computation, and information theory, no single
definition for life has yet achieved universal acceptance. This challenge
becomes increasingly urgent as advances in synthetic biology, artificial
intelligence, and astrobiology challenge our traditional conceptions of what it
means to be alive. We undertook a methodological approach that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to analyze a set of definitions of life provided by a
curated set of cross-disciplinary experts. We used a novel pairwise correlation
analysis to map the definitions into distinct feature vectors, followed by
agglomerative clustering, intra-cluster semantic analysis, and t-SNE projection
to reveal underlying conceptual archetypes. This methodology revealed a
continuous landscape of the themes relating to the definition of life,
suggesting that what has historically been approached as a binary taxonomic
problem should be instead conceived as differentiated perspectives within a
unified conceptual latent space. We offer a new methodological bridge between
reductionist and holistic approaches to fundamental questions in science and
philosophy, demonstrating how computational semantic analysis can reveal
conceptual patterns across disciplinary boundaries, and opening similar
pathways for addressing other contested definitional territories across the
sciences.

Method: 提出了MPPFND数据集以捕获多平台传播结构，并设计APSL模型利用图神经网络提取多平台社交上下文特征。

Result: 实验表明，考虑跨平台传播差异能提高假新闻检测性能。

Conclusion: 多平台传播特征的引入显著提升了假新闻检测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Fake news spreads widely on social media, leading to numerous negative
effects. Most existing detection algorithms focus on analyzing news content and
social context to detect fake news. However, these approaches typically detect
fake news based on specific platforms, ignoring differences in propagation
characteristics across platforms. In this paper, we introduce the MPPFND
dataset, which captures propagation structures across multiple platforms. We
also describe the commenting and propagation characteristics of different
platforms to show that their social contexts have distinct features. We propose
a multi-platform fake news detection model (APSL) that uses graph neural
networks to extract social context features from various platforms. Experiments
show that accounting for cross-platform propagation differences improves fake
news detection performance.

Abstract: $\textbf{Graph Coarsening (GC)}$ is a prominent graph reduction technique
that compresses large graphs to enable efficient learning and inference.
However, existing GC methods generate only one coarsened graph per run and must
recompute from scratch for each new coarsening ratio, resulting in unnecessary
overhead. Moreover, most prior approaches are tailored to
$\textit{homogeneous}$ graphs and fail to accommodate the semantic constraints
of $\textit{heterogeneous}$ graphs, which comprise multiple node and edge
types. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
combines Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with Consistent Hashing to enable
$\textit{adaptive graph coarsening}$. Leveraging hashing techniques, our method
is inherently fast and scalable. For heterogeneous graphs, we propose a
$\textit{type isolated coarsening}$ strategy that ensures semantic consistency
by restricting merges to nodes of the same type. Our approach is the first
unified framework to support both adaptive and heterogeneous coarsening.
Extensive evaluations on 23 real-world datasets including homophilic,
heterophilic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous graphs demonstrate that our method
achieves superior scalability while preserving the structural and semantic
integrity of the original graph.
