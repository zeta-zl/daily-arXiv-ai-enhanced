We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic\nperspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured\ninto coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an\napproach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide\nstronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing\ntrustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the\nresearch community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents\nthat integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and\nanalysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content\ngeneration. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive\nperception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing\nthe boundaries of video understanding."}

Amid the growing hype around improved\nreasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the\nformulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting\nthe popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't\nquite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions\ninclude (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with\nstates becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs\nand (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the\ntrajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these\nsimplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an\noutcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including\nGSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised\nfine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves\nperformance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the\nstructural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer\nsequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of \"RL\ngenerating longer thinking traces.\" While RL may well be a very useful\ntechnique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows\nthat the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP\nrender the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable."}

To investigate\nthis, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), a high-quality dataset of\nunanswerable math problems designed to probe models' ability to recognize an\nunanswerable question by reasoning from the insufficient or ambiguous\ninformation. Our results show that standard RFT training could reduce model\nrefusal rates by more than 80%, which significantly increases model's tendency\nto hallucinate.

By constructing a formal\ninterpreter of the semantics of our problems and intended algorithm, we\nsystematically evaluate not only solution accuracy but also the correctness of\nintermediate traces, thus allowing us to evaluate whether the latter causally\ninfluences the former. We notice that, despite significant improvements on the\nsolution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce\ninvalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show\nthat trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then\ntrain models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific\nproblem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain\nlargely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can\nimprove upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks.\nThese results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or \"Chains of\nThought\" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against\nanthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly\ncorrect forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language\nmodels."}

To address\nthis issue, this paper utilized the structural features and section texts\nobtained from the section structure information of academic articles to extract\nkeyphrase from academic papers. The approach consists of two main parts: (1)\nexploring the effect of seven structural features on KPE models, and (2)\nintegrating the extraction results from all section texts used as input corpora\nfor KPE models via a keyphrase integration algorithm to obtain the keyphrase\nintegration result. Furthermore, this paper also examined the effect of the\nclassification quality of section structure on the KPE performance. The results\nshow that incorporating structural features improves KPE performance, though\ndifferent features have varying effects on model efficacy. The keyphrase\nintegration approach yields the best performance, and the classification\nquality of section structure can affect KPE performance.

Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations\nthat are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds\nof computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the\nresidual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First,\ncomparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that\nlayers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half,\nwith a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers\nin the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output\npredictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that\nmodels are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving\nmany hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using\ntheir additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we\ntrain linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one.\nWe find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other,\nsuggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over\nits many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using\ntheir depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth\nto perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual.

Extensive experiments on multi-domain\ntranslation and multilingual translation benchmarks with different\narchitectures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of THOR-MoE.\nAdditionally, the THOR-MoE operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with\nexisting Top-$k$~\\cite{shazeer2017} and Top-$p$~\\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}\nrouting schemes, ensuring broad applicability across diverse MoE architectures.\nFor instance, compared with vanilla Top-$p$~\\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}\nrouting, the context-aware manner can achieve an average improvement of 0.75\nBLEU with less than 22\\% activated parameters on multi-domain translation\ntasks."}

Measuring the similarity between two spatial\nlabelings is essential for understanding their differences and the contributing\nfactors, such as changes in location properties or labeling methods. An\nadequate and unbiased measurement of spatial labeling similarity should\nconsider the number of matched labels (label agreement), the topology of\nspatial label distribution, and the heterogeneous impacts of mismatched labels.\nHowever, existing methods often fail to account for all these aspects. To\naddress this gap, we propose a methodological framework to guide the\ndevelopment of methods that meet these requirements. Given two spatial\nlabelings, the framework transforms them into graphs based on location\norganization, labels, and attributes (e.g., location significance). The\ndistributions of their graph attributes are then extracted, enabling an\nefficient computation of distributional discrepancy to reflect the\ndissimilarity level between the two labelings. We further provide a concrete\nimplementation of this framework, termed Spatial Labeling Analogy Metric\n(SLAM), along with an analysis of its theoretical foundation, for evaluating\nspatial labeling results in spatial transcriptomics (ST) \\textit{as per} their\nsimilarity with ground truth labeling.

We notice that, despite significant improvements on the\nsolution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce\ninvalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show\nthat trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then\ntrain models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific\nproblem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain\nlargely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can\nimprove upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks.\nThese results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or \"Chains of\nThought\" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against\nanthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly\ncorrect forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language\nmodels."}

This hybrid\ndesign provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands\ncandidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking.\nExperiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves\nreranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from\n32.0 to 39.7. Overall, these results highlight the value of information\nextraction for reranking in scientific retrieval."}

To address these\ncomplexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection\nframework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world\nenvironments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict\nsequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual\nunstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs\nadaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a\ntransformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language\nmodeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic\nand semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are\nidentified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into\nlog-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only\non normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system\nbehaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in\ntraditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird,\nand Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared\nto state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods.

Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive\npipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental\nhealth contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of\nnumerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the\nreliability and interpretability of its predictions. Evaluations of two\nreal-world datasets, PMData and Globem, demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed methods, achieving substantial improvements over general LLMs. We\nanticipate that ProMind-LLM will pave the way for more dependable,\ninterpretable, and scalable mental health case solutions."}

Existing approaches require labour-intensive\nannotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying interaction context, or\nare useful only in the scenarios they are designed for. To address these\nlimits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM),\na new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash\nor risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the\nextent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe\nextreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by\ncontext-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road\nusers. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails\nhigher risk of potential collision. Then a context-adaptive risk score and its\nassociated probability can be calculated based on the theory of extreme values.\nAny measurable factors, such as motion kinematics, weather, lighting, can serve\nas part of the context, allowing for diverse coverage of safety-critical\ninteractions. Multiple public driving datasets are used to train GSSMs, which\nare tested with 4,875 real-world crashes and near-crashes reconstructed from\nthe SHRP2 NDS. A vanilla GSSM using only instantaneous states achieves AUPRC of\n0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential\ncollisions. Additional data and contextual factors provide further performance\ngains. Across various interaction types such as rear-end, merging, and\ncrossing, the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing\nbaselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and\ngeneralisable foundation to proactively quantify collision risk in traffic\ninteractions."}

Quantization-aware training (QAT)\naddresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining\nperformance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit\nprecision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often\nignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization\ngranularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified\nscaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,\ntraining data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,\nwe show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises\nwith more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the\nsources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation\ncomponents. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization\nerror, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization\nerror increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows\nthat the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is\nthe primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying\nmixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that\nweight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.\nAdditionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually\nexceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight\nquantization error is also important in such scenarios.

In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning\nagent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step\ncausal inference.

In this work, we first conduct an extensive experiment showing\nthat advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end\nLALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a\nnovel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio\ndoes not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal\njailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is\neffective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into\nperturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak\naudios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent\nconcealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios\nremain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the\nreverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation\nof the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot\noffer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness.\nMoreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully\nmanipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario.

We show that TTMM is an approximation of test-time training (TTT),\nwhich fine-tunes an expert model for each prediction task, i.e., prompt. TTT\nhas recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is\ncomputationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more\nexperts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B\nparameter base model, TTMM is more than 100x faster than TTT at test-time by\namortizing the cost of TTT at train-time. Thus, TTMM offers a promising\ncost-effective approach to scale test-time training."}

To support this, we\nintroduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational\nvideos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.\nThis dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic\ninteractions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal\nLLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual\ncontext to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is\nappropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x\nimprovement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These\nresults underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely,\nnatural, and engaging conversational AI."}

Despite notable advances,\nexisting reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like\noverthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nnovel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts\n(RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training\nor complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information\n(nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive\nexperts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by\ntokens like ''<think>''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs\n(DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning\nbenchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning\naccuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our\nlightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering\ntechniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving\nthe model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight\nreinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable\ndirection to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models."}
