### [1] [Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704)
*Feng Yao,Zilong Wang,Liyuan Liu,Junxia Cui,Li Zhong,Xiaohan Fu,Haohui Mai,Vish Krishnan,Jianfeng Gao,Jingbo Shang*

Key words: 大语言模型, 代码生成, 强化学习, 程序分析, 单元测试

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REAL的强化学习框架，通过程序分析和单元测试反馈，激励大语言模型生成高质量代码，克服了现有方法在可扩展性和有效性上的限制。

Motivation: 现有代码生成方法依赖人工标注或规则后处理，难以确保代码的安全性（如SQL注入漏洞）和可维护性（如类型注解缺失），限制了其实际应用效果。

Method: REAL框架结合两种自动信号：程序分析检测安全或可维护性缺陷，以及单元测试确保功能正确性，无需人工干预即可提供可扩展的监督。

Result: 实验表明，REAL在功能性和代码质量评估中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: REAL填补了快速原型和生产级代码之间的差距，使大语言模型既能快速生成代码又能保证质量。

Abstract: Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding,
is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality,
particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and
maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive
annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that
incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program
analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals:
(1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit
tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is
prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without
manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales
demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous
assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between
rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both
speed and quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Climate Finance Bench 提出了一个开放基准，用于评估大型语言模型对公司气候披露的问答能力，并比较了 RAG 方法，发现检索器的性能是关键瓶颈。

Motivation: 为了提高对企业气候披露信息的问答能力，并推动透明碳报告在气候 AI 应用中的发展。

Method: 收集了 33 份英文可持续发展报告，标注了 330 个专家验证的问答对，比较了 RAG 方法。

Result: 发现检索器的检索能力是性能瓶颈，并提出量化权重等技术可优化碳报告透明度。

Conclusion: RAG 方法在气候披露问答中有潜力，但需优化检索器性能，并重视碳报告的透明度。

Abstract: Climate Finance Bench introduces an open benchmark that targets
question-answering over corporate climate disclosures using Large Language
Models. We curate 33 recent sustainability reports in English drawn from
companies across all 11 GICS sectors and annotate 330 expert-validated
question-answer pairs that span pure extraction, numerical reasoning, and
logical reasoning. Building on this dataset, we propose a comparison of RAG
(retrieval-augmented generation) approaches. We show that the retriever's
ability to locate passages that actually contain the answer is the chief
performance bottleneck. We further argue for transparent carbon reporting in
AI-for-climate applications, highlighting advantages of techniques such as
Weight Quantization.

### [3] [Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757)

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多令牌预测（MTP）是一种新兴的语言模型预训练目标，能同时预测多个令牌，提升模型性能。然而，小型语言模型（SLM）难以适应MTP。本文提出两种课程学习策略（正向和反向）帮助SLM更好利用MTP，实验显示正向策略在提升NTP性能的同时保留了自推测解码优势，反向策略虽提升性能但无此优势。

Motivation: 解决小型语言模型在MTP训练中的适应性问题，探索课程学习策略以优化其预训练效果。

Method: 提出两种课程学习变体：正向（从NTP逐步过渡到MTP）和反向（相反顺序），并评估其对SLM的影响。

Result: 正向策略使SLM更高效利用MTP，提升下游NTP性能和生成质量，保留自推测解码优势；反向策略虽提升性能但无解码优势。

Conclusion: 课程学习策略（尤其是正向）能有效帮助SLM适应MTP，平衡性能与解码效率。

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAMA系列模型是首个基于开源数据和代码的语音基础模型，填补了语音处理领域开放科学的空白，性能与现有模型相当且更高效。

Motivation: 现有语音基础模型（如Whisper和SeamlessM4T）的封闭性导致可重现性和公平评估的挑战，而其他领域已通过开源模型取得进展。

Method: 开发FAMA系列模型，使用超过15万小时的开源语音数据进行训练，并提供一个包含1.6万小时清理和伪标注语音的新数据集。

Result: FAMA在性能上与现有模型竞争，且速度快达8倍。所有代码、数据集和模型均以开源许可发布。

Conclusion: FAMA推动了语音技术研究的开放性和透明度，为语音处理领域提供了一个可重现的基准。

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and
SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However,
their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major
reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made
substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models
trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain
limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science
SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data.
Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and
pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves
competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times
faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under
OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了StressTest基准，用于评估语音感知语言模型（SLMs）在句子重音推理任务中的表现，并通过合成数据集Stress17k优化模型，最终模型StresSLM在任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 句子重音在语音中至关重要，但现有的SLMs对其处理能力不足，缺乏专门的评估和优化方法。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入StressTest基准，提出合成数据生成流程创建Stress17k数据集，并用于微调SLMs。

Result: 微调后的模型StresSLM在句子重音推理和检测任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据优化可以提升SLMs对句子重音的处理能力。

Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken
utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It
is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated.
Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct
processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the
full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as
spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in
shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation
and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by
introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's
ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the
stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find
that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation
pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning
implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models
with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables
effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model,
StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress
reasoning and detection tasks. Code, models, data, and audio samples -

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将反馈驱动的注释（如拼写、语法错误和论证成分标记）整合到自动作文评分（AES）流程中，结合生成式语言模型和编码器式分类器，提升了评分准确性。

Motivation: 利用PERSUADE语料库，探索如何通过反馈驱动的注释增强AES系统的表现。

Method: 集成两种注释：拼写/语法错误标记和论证成分识别，使用生成式模型和编码器分类器实现，并将注释融入评分流程。

Result: 实验表明，融合注释的编码器式大语言模型在评分性能上有所提升。

Conclusion: 反馈驱动的注释能有效改进AES系统的准确性，尤其在处理复杂文本结构时。

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into
the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES).
This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting,
and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We
integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify
spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative
components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world
scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language
model used for spell-correction and an encoder-based token classifier trained
to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into
the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using
encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

Key words: 树库, 句法结构, 口语与书面语, 依赖解析, 英语, 斯洛文尼亚语

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于树库的新方法，通过依赖解析语料库比较口语和书面语的句法结构，发现口语的结构更少、多样性更低，且与书面语结构重叠有限。

Motivation: 研究旨在系统比较口语和书面语的句法结构差异，以理解实时互动和精心写作的不同需求如何影响句法组织。

Method: 采用自下而上的归纳方法，从英语和斯洛文尼亚语的Universal Dependencies树库中提取去词汇化的依赖子树，分析其大小、多样性和分布。

Result: 口语语料库的句法结构更少、多样性更低，且与书面语结构重叠有限，显示出模态特定的句法偏好。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨语料库的句法变异性研究提供了可扩展、语言无关的方法，支持更全面的语法使用理论。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel treebank-driven approach to comparing syntactic
structures in speech and writing using dependency-parsed corpora. Adopting a
fully inductive, bottom-up method, we define syntactic structures as
delexicalized dependency (sub)trees and extract them from spoken and written
Universal Dependencies (UD) treebanks in two syntactically distinct languages,
English and Slovenian. For each corpus, we analyze the size, diversity, and
distribution of syntactic inventories, their overlap across modalities, and the
structures most characteristic of speech. Results show that, across both
languages, spoken corpora contain fewer and less diverse syntactic structures
than their written counterparts, with consistent cross-linguistic preferences
for certain structural types across modalities. Strikingly, the overlap between
spoken and written syntactic inventories is very limited: most structures
attested in speech do not occur in writing, pointing to modality-specific
preferences in syntactic organization that reflect the distinct demands of
real-time interaction and elaborated writing. This contrast is further
supported by a keyness analysis of the most frequent speech-specific
structures, which highlights patterns associated with interactivity,
context-grounding, and economy of expression. We argue that this scalable,
language-independent framework offers a useful general method for
systematically studying syntactic variation across corpora, laying the
groundwork for more comprehensive data-driven theories of grammar in use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MEDAL，一个自动化多智能体框架，用于生成、评估和筛选更具代表性和多样性的开放领域对话评估基准，以解决现有基准数据集静态、过时且多语言覆盖不足的问题。

Motivation: 现有评估基准数据集多为静态、过时且缺乏多语言覆盖，无法捕捉细微的语言和文化差异，限制了对话系统性能评估的准确性。

Method: 利用多个先进的LLM生成多语言用户-聊天机器人对话，基于多样化的种子上下文；使用GPT-4.1对聊天机器人性能进行多维分析。

Result: 发现跨语言性能差异显著，并发现当前LLM在检测涉及同理心和推理的细微问题时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一个新的多语言基准，并通过实验验证了当前LLM作为开放领域对话评估器的局限性。

Abstract: As the capabilities of chatbots and their underlying LLMs continue to
dramatically improve, evaluating their performance has increasingly become a
major blocker to their further development. A major challenge is the available
benchmarking datasets, which are largely static, outdated, and lacking in
multilingual coverage, limiting their ability to capture subtle linguistic and
cultural variations. This paper introduces MEDAL, an automated multi-agent
framework for generating, evaluating, and curating more representative and
diverse open-domain dialogue evaluation benchmarks. Our approach leverages
several state-of-the-art LLMs to generate user-chatbot multilingual dialogues,
conditioned on varied seed contexts. A strong LLM (GPT-4.1) is then used for a
multidimensional analysis of the performance of the chatbots, uncovering
noticeable cross-lingual performance differences. Guided by this large-scale
evaluation, we curate a new meta-evaluation multilingual benchmark and
human-annotate samples with nuanced quality judgments. This benchmark is then
used to assess the ability of several reasoning and non-reasoning LLMs to act
as evaluators of open-domain dialogues. We find that current LLMs struggle to
detect nuanced issues, particularly those involving empathy and reasoning.

Key words: 系统性综述, 大语言模型, 临床决策, 证据评估, MedEvidence

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLMs）在系统性综述（SR）生成中表现有限，无法完全匹配临床专家的结论，且存在过度自信和缺乏科学怀疑的问题。

Motivation: 随着科学文献的爆炸式增长，探索LLMs在自动化生成系统性综述方面的潜力，但其在批判性评估和多文档推理方面的能力尚不明确。

Method: 通过MedEvidence基准（包含100篇SR及其基础研究），对24种LLMs（包括推理型、非推理型、医学专用型及不同规模模型）进行系统评估。

Result: 推理能力未显著提升性能，模型规模与性能无直接关联，知识微调反而降低准确性。模型普遍存在响应过长时性能下降、过度自信及对低质量研究缺乏质疑的问题。

Conclusion: LLMs目前无法可靠匹配专家SR生成的结论，其临床部署需更多改进。代码与基准已开源供进一步研究。

Abstract: Systematic reviews (SR), in which experts summarize and analyze evidence
across individual studies to provide insights on a specialized topic, are a
cornerstone for evidence-based clinical decision-making, research, and policy.
Given the exponential growth of scientific articles, there is growing interest
in using large language models (LLMs) to automate SR generation. However, the
ability of LLMs to critically assess evidence and reason across multiple
documents to provide recommendations at the same proficiency as domain experts
remains poorly characterized. We therefore ask: Can LLMs match the conclusions
of systematic reviews written by clinical experts when given access to the same
studies? To explore this question, we present MedEvidence, a benchmark pairing
findings from 100 SRs with the studies they are based on. We benchmark 24 LLMs
on MedEvidence, including reasoning, non-reasoning, medical specialist, and
models across varying sizes (from 7B-700B). Through our systematic evaluation,
we find that reasoning does not necessarily improve performance, larger models
do not consistently yield greater gains, and knowledge-based fine-tuning
degrades accuracy on MedEvidence. Instead, most models exhibit similar
behavior: performance tends to degrade as token length increases, their
responses show overconfidence, and, contrary to human experts, all models show
a lack of scientific skepticism toward low-quality findings. These results
suggest that more work is still required before LLMs can reliably match the
observations from expert-conducted SRs, even though these systems are already
deployed and being used by clinicians. We release our codebase and benchmark to
the broader research community to further investigate LLM-based SR systems.

### [10] [Towards a More Generalized Approach in Open Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22801)

Key words: Open Relation Extraction, MixORE, 关系分类, 聚类, 未标记数据

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MixORE，一个两阶段框架，用于通用的OpenRE设置，能在未标记数据中同时学习已知和新关系，优于现有基线。

Motivation: 现实场景中新关系是随机分布的，传统OpenRE方法无法处理未标记数据中已知和新关系的混合。

Method: 提出MixORE框架，通过关系分类和聚类的两阶段方法联合学习已知和新关系。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MixORE在已知关系分类和新关系聚类上均优于对比方法。

Conclusion: MixORE推动了通用OpenRE研究和实际应用的进展。

Abstract: Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel
relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined
relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the
unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known
and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are
arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting
that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances.
To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates
relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel
relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE
consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification
and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of
generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的LLM代理交互范式——'旁听代理'，通过'监听'人类对话在背景中完成任务或提供建议，并以《龙与地下城》游戏为例展开研究。

Motivation: 探索LLM代理的被动交互模式，即在人类对话中不主动参与而是通过监听提供帮助，以解决传统直接交互模式的局限性。

Method: 利用大型多模态音频-语言模型作为旁听代理，辅助《龙与地下城》游戏中的地下城主，通过人评估验证其有效性。

Result: 研究发现某些大型音频-语言模型具备通过隐式音频线索完成任务的能力，且评估显示这些代理对用户有帮助。

Conclusion: 旁听代理是一种可行的LLM交互范式，未来可通过开源工具进一步探索其潜力。

Abstract: Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist
human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with
LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not
actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on
human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide
suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents
paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an
in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing
agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the
helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have
the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio
cues. Finally, we release Python libraries and our project code to support
further research into the overhearing agents paradigm at
https://github.com/zhudotexe/overhearing_agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SR-NLE框架通过自反馈和特征归因反馈机制，无需外部监督即可提高LLM生成解释的忠实度。实验显示，该方法显著降低了不忠实率。

Motivation: 现有LLM生成的自然语言解释常无法忠实反映模型推理过程，亟需一种无需外部监督的自我改进方法。

Method: 提出SR-NLE框架，结合自反馈和基于特征归因的新型反馈机制，迭代优化解释的忠实性。

Result: 在三个数据集和四种先进LLM上的实验表明，SR-NLE平均不忠实率降至36.02%，比基线（54.81%）绝对降低18.79%。

Conclusion: LLM可通过适当反馈机制自我优化解释，无需额外训练，显著提升解释忠实性。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language
explanations (NLEs) have become increasingly important for understanding model
predictions. However, these explanations often fail to faithfully represent the
model's actual reasoning process. While existing work has demonstrated that
LLMs can self-critique and refine their initial outputs for various tasks, this
capability remains unexplored for improving explanation faithfulness. To
address this gap, we introduce Self-critique and Refinement for Natural
Language Explanations (SR-NLE), a framework that enables models to improve the
faithfulness of their own explanations -- specifically, post-hoc NLEs --
through an iterative critique and refinement process without external
supervision. Our framework leverages different feedback mechanisms to guide the
refinement process, including natural language self-feedback and, notably, a
novel feedback approach based on feature attribution that highlights important
input words. Our experiments across three datasets and four state-of-the-art
LLMs demonstrate that SR-NLE significantly reduces unfaithfulness rates, with
our best method achieving an average unfaithfulness rate of 36.02%, compared to
54.81% for baseline -- an absolute reduction of 18.79%. These findings reveal
that the investigated LLMs can indeed refine their explanations to better
reflect their actual reasoning process, requiring only appropriate guidance
through feedback without additional training or fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了用大语言模型（LLM）生成评测基准的可行性，发现虽能低成本生成有效数据，但相比人工标注数据对LLM的挑战性更低。

Motivation: 研究LLM生成评测基准的能力及其与人工标注数据的差异，以评估该方法的实际效果与潜在问题。

Method: 通过两个案例研究（CondaQA和DROP数据集），比较LLM生成数据与人工标注数据的有效性和挑战性。

Result: LLM生成的数据成本低且通常有效，但对LLM的测试挑战性显著低于人工标注数据。

Conclusion: 需审慎评估直接使用LLM生成评测基准的做法，因其可能降低评测的严谨性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation.
However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging
paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting
shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether
LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and
comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we
evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two
high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning
about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find
that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid
according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the
original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging
for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on
what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for
critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent
approach to benchmark creation.

Motivation: 现有位置编码方法理论基础不足且评估不全面。

Method: 将位置编码建模为概率模型中的先验，提出广义高斯位置先验。

Result: 在5倍训练上下文长度下准确率显著提升，保持困惑度接近的同时引入极少参数。

Conclusion: BAM理论框架统一性强，长上下文表现优越。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models rely on positional encoding (PE) to handle
token order and support context length extrapolation. However, existing PE
methods lack theoretical clarity and rely on limited evaluation metrics to
substantiate their extrapolation claims. We propose the Bayesian Attention
Mechanism (BAM), a theoretical framework that formulates positional encoding as
a prior within a probabilistic model. BAM unifies existing methods (e.g., NoPE
and ALiBi) and motivates a new Generalized Gaussian positional prior that
substantially improves long-context generalization. Empirically, BAM enables
accurate information retrieval at $500\times$ the training context length,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art context length generalization in long
context retrieval accuracy while maintaining comparable perplexity and
introducing minimal additional parameters.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自然语言推理（NLI）中的人类标签变异（HLV）及标注者同一标签下的推理差异，提出了一种基于语言学的分类法LITEX，用于系统化标注自由文本解释，并在e-SNLI数据集上验证其可靠性和解释生成效果。

Motivation: 为了解决NLI中标注者同一标签下推理差异的问题，并系统化理解NLI标签背后的理性，本文引入了LITEX这一分类法，旨在捕捉这一变异并改进解释生成。

Method: 引入了LITEX这一基于语言学的分类法，并在e-SNLI数据集的一个子集上进行了标注和验证，评估其对解释生成的效果。

Result: LITEX被验证为可靠且能更好地与NLI标签、高亮部分和解释对齐，使用LITEX生成的解释在语言学上比基于标签或高亮部分的解释更接近人类解释。

Conclusion: LITEX不仅捕捉了标签内部的变异，还通过分类指导的生成更好地缩小了人类与模型解释间的差距。

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural
Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same
premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where
annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an
additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain
highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the
NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text
explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To
systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales
behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for
categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset
of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it
aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the
taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that
conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically
closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or
highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also
shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between
human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt)的方法，用于多语言新闻叙事分类，并在SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2中取得了最佳成绩。

Motivation: 随着在线新闻数量的增加和错误信息的传播，开发自动化的数据分析方法变得尤为重要。叙事分类是关键任务，因为它有助于识别在线内容，对事实核查者和政策制定者等专业人士至关重要。

Method: 采用分层三步提示策略（H3Prompt），首先将文章分类到两个领域之一（乌克兰-俄罗斯战争或气候变化），然后识别主要叙事，最后分配子叙事。

Result: 该方法在28个全球竞争团队中，在英语测试集上取得了第一名。

Conclusion: H3Prompt在多语言叙事分类任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The proliferation of online news and the increasing spread of misinformation
necessitate robust methods for automatic data analysis. Narrative
classification is emerging as a important task, since identifying what is being
said online is critical for fact-checkers, policy markers and other
professionals working on information studies. This paper presents our approach
to SemEval 2025 Task 10 Subtask 2, which aims to classify news articles into a
pre-defined two-level taxonomy of main narratives and sub-narratives across
multiple languages.
  We propose Hierarchical Three-Step Prompting (H3Prompt) for multilingual
narrative classification. Our methodology follows a three-step Large Language
Model (LLM) prompting strategy, where the model first categorises an article
into one of two domains (Ukraine-Russia War or Climate Change), then identifies
the most relevant main narratives, and finally assigns sub-narratives. Our
approach secured the top position on the English test set among 28 competing
teams worldwide. The code is available at https://github.com/GateNLP/H3Prompt.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 当前大规模推理模型（LRMs）在多语言推理任务中表现不佳，常回退到英语或生成碎片化推理。通过提示干预和少量样本微调可改善推理可读性，但会降低答案准确性。研究揭示了多语言推理能力的局限性。

Motivation: 研究多语言推理能力的重要性，因为用户需要以母语理解推理过程以实现有效监督，而现有LRMs在这方面表现不佳。

Method: 通过在XReasoning基准上全面评估两种主流LRMs，包括提示干预和少量样本微调。

Result: 发现即使是先进模型也常回退到英语或生成碎片化推理，提示干预改善可读性但降低准确性，少量微调可缓解问题但仍有准确性损失。

Conclusion: 当前LRMs的多语言推理能力有限，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong
performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in
other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer
accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace
useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We
comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning
benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English
or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap
in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to
reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce
answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted
post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some
accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning
capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Betswish/mCoT-XReasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了VIGNETTE基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的偏见，涵盖事实性、感知、刻板印象和决策四个方向，揭示了模型在身份识别的社会刻板印象和多方面偏见。

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注肖像图像和性别职业关联，忽略了更广泛的社会刻板印象及其潜在危害，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 通过大规模VQA基准VIGNETTE（含3000万+图像），结合社会心理学，分析VLMs如何基于视觉身份线索推断特性和角色。

Result: 研究发现VLMs存在微妙、多方面的刻板印象模式，揭示了模型如何从输入中构建社会意义。

Conclusion: VIGNETTE为评估VLMs偏见提供了更全面的框架，揭示了社会刻板印象在模型中的体现。

Abstract: While bias in large language models (LLMs) is well-studied, similar concerns
in vision-language models (VLMs) have received comparatively less attention.
Existing VLM bias studies often focus on portrait-style images and
gender-occupation associations, overlooking broader and more complex social
stereotypes and their implied harm. This work introduces VIGNETTE, a
large-scale VQA benchmark with 30M+ images for evaluating bias in VLMs through
a question-answering framework spanning four directions: factuality,
perception, stereotyping, and decision making. Beyond narrowly-centered
studies, we assess how VLMs interpret identities in contextualized settings,
revealing how models make trait and capability assumptions and exhibit patterns
of discrimination. Drawing from social psychology, we examine how VLMs connect
visual identity cues to trait and role-based inferences, encoding social
hierarchies, through biased selections. Our findings uncover subtle,
multifaceted, and surprising stereotypical patterns, offering insights into how
VLMs construct social meaning from inputs.

Motivation: 现有的研究主要关注LLMs的表层社会偏见或孤立刻板印象，缺乏对模型如何通过归因推理传递偏见的深入分析。

Method: 提出一种基于认知基础的偏见评估框架，分析LLMs如何将事件结果归因于内部或外部因素，并揭示这种归因对人口群体的不公平影响。

Result: 研究揭示了LLMs在归因事件结果时存在的认知偏差，并展示了这些偏差如何加剧对特定人口群体的偏见。

Conclusion: 通过认知基础的评估框架可以更深入地理解LLMs的偏见机制，为未来公平性改进提供方向。

Abstract: When a student fails an exam, do we tend to blame their effort or the test's
difficulty? Attribution, defined as how reasons are assigned to event outcomes,
shapes perceptions, reinforces stereotypes, and influences decisions.
Attribution Theory in social psychology explains how humans assign
responsibility for events using implicit cognition, attributing causes to
internal (e.g., effort, ability) or external (e.g., task difficulty, luck)
factors. LLMs' attribution of event outcomes based on demographics carries
important fairness implications. Most works exploring social biases in LLMs
focus on surface-level associations or isolated stereotypes. This work proposes
a cognitively grounded bias evaluation framework to identify how models'
reasoning disparities channelize biases toward demographic groups.

TL;DR: ER-Reason是一个新的基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型在急诊室临床推理和决策中的表现，揭示了模型与医生临床推理之间的差距。

Motivation: 现有的评估主要依赖昂贵的人工标注和孤立的测试任务，未能全面反映真实的临床推理和决策流程。

Method: 利用3,984名患者的25,174份纵向临床笔记，设计了覆盖急诊工作流关键阶段的评估任务，并收集了72份医生撰写的推理过程。

Result: 评估发现当前最先进的大型语言模型与医生临床推理存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 未来研究需要缩小大型语言模型与真实临床推理的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical
question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world
evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks
tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or
full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce
ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and
decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where
clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient
presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes
data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal
clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and
physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER
provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key
stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment
selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to
reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via
rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales
explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in
residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations
of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and
clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need
for future research to bridge this divide.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种带有长期记忆机制的模型架构，通过显式记忆单元、门控写入机制和基于注意力的读取模块，结合遗忘功能动态更新记忆内容，提升了模型在处理长期依赖时的性能。

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在理解长期上下文时存在局限性，容易丢失历史信息或出现语义漂移。

Method: 设计了集成记忆单元和遗忘机制的模型，采用联合训练目标（主任务损失与记忆读写约束结合），并系统性评估了不同记忆结构的效果。

Result: 模型在文本生成一致性、多轮问答稳定性和跨上下文推理准确性上表现优异，尤其在长文本任务中展现出更强的语义保留和上下文连贯性。

Conclusion: 实验验证了记忆机制对语言理解的关键作用，证明了该架构设计在性能和可行性上的有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of large language models in
understanding long-term context. It proposes a model architecture equipped with
a long-term memory mechanism to improve the retention and retrieval of semantic
information across paragraphs and dialogue turns. The model integrates explicit
memory units, gated writing mechanisms, and attention-based reading modules. A
forgetting function is introduced to enable dynamic updates of memory content,
enhancing the model's ability to manage historical information. To further
improve the effectiveness of memory operations, the study designs a joint
training objective. This combines the main task loss with constraints on memory
writing and forgetting. It guides the model to learn better memory strategies
during task execution. Systematic evaluation across multiple subtasks shows
that the model achieves clear advantages in text generation consistency,
stability in multi-turn question answering, and accuracy in cross-context
reasoning. In particular, the model demonstrates strong semantic retention and
contextual coherence in long-text tasks and complex question answering
scenarios. It effectively mitigates the context loss and semantic drift
problems commonly faced by traditional language models when handling long-term
dependencies. The experiments also include analysis of different memory
structures, capacity sizes, and control strategies. These results further
confirm the critical role of memory mechanisms in language understanding. They
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in both
architectural design and performance outcomes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了OSRM方法，通过约束LoRA子空间提升模型合并性能，解决了低秩适应（LoRA）模型合并时的性能下降问题。

Motivation: 现有方法在合并LoRA微调模型时性能下降明显，主要因为参数与数据分布的交互未被充分考虑。

Method: 提出OSRM方法，预先约束LoRA子空间以避免任务间干扰，并与现有合并算法兼容。

Result: 在八个数据集和多种大型语言模型上验证，OSRM显著提升合并性能并保持单任务准确性。

Conclusion: 数据与参数交互对模型合并至关重要，OSRM为LoRA模型合并提供了即插即用解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong
performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore
model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task
model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail
for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a
previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data
distributions. We propose Orthogonal Subspaces for Robust model Merging (OSRM)
to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates
relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach
can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the
unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets,
tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our
method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task
accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the
hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of
data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution
for merging LoRA models.

Conclusion: R1强化学习框架能有效提升网页代理在业务场景中的单步推理和规划能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-empowered web agents enables automating complex,
real-time web navigation tasks in enterprise environments. However, existing
web agents relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often struggle with
generalization and robustness due to insufficient reasoning capabilities when
handling the inherently dynamic nature of web interactions. In this study, we
introduce WorkForceAgent-R1, an LLM-based web agent trained using a rule-based
R1-style reinforcement learning framework designed explicitly to enhance
single-step reasoning and planning for business-oriented web navigation tasks.
We employ a structured reward function that evaluates both adherence to output
formats and correctness of actions, enabling WorkForceAgent-R1 to implicitly
learn robust intermediate reasoning without explicit annotations or extensive
expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments on the WorkArena benchmark
demonstrate that WorkForceAgent-R1 substantially outperforms SFT baselines by
10.26-16.59%, achieving competitive performance relative to proprietary
LLM-based agents (gpt-4o) in workplace-oriented web navigation tasks.

Motivation: 尽管预训练的多模态表示（如CLIP）展现出强大能力，但它们存在组合脆弱性，导致反直觉的判断。论文旨在通过基准测试和方法改进揭示并解决这一问题。

Method: 提出MAC基准，利用LLMs生成欺骗性文本样本，评估多模态表示的脆弱性；采用自训练方法，结合拒绝采样微调和多样性促进过滤，提升性能。

Result: 使用较小语言模型（如Llama-3.1-8B）的方法在多模态表示（图像、视频、音频）中展现更强的组合脆弱性揭示能力，攻击成功率和样本多样性均显著提升。

Conclusion: MAC基准和方法有效揭示了多模态表示的组合脆弱性，自训练策略显著提升了零样本方法的鲁棒性和多样性。

Abstract: While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown
impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities
leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial
Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across
different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success
rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we
propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning
with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and
sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach
demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities
across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and
audios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型(LLMs)在多语言和跨语言记忆方面的能力，发现即使是没有直接翻译的文本，LLMs也能在不同语言中回忆内容。

Motivation: 探究LLMs在多语言和跨语言环境中的记忆能力，特别是在非英语语言或翻译文本中的表现。

Method: 使用OWL数据集（包含10种语言的31.5K对齐文本片段），通过直接探测、名称补齐和前缀生成三种任务评估模型记忆能力。

Result: LLMs在不同语言中表现出稳定的记忆能力，例如GPT-4o在新翻译的文本中识别作者和标题的准确率为69%，而扰动（如字符屏蔽、单词打乱）仅轻微降低准确性。

Conclusion: LLMs具有显著的跨语言记忆能力，并且模型之间在表现上存在差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text
from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability
generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains
unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in
LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be
recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset
of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English
originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new
translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili,
Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families
and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to
identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting
masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating
continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages,
even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for
example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6%
of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking
characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop
for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of
cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the
models.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在高风险应用中的部署，评估其对否定句的理解能力变得至关重要。

Method: 利用大语言模型从现有VQA数据集中生成否定问题，构建包含7,379个问题的NegVQA基准测试。

Result: 评估显示，20种先进模型在否定句理解上表现显著下降，且模型规模呈现U形扩展趋势。

Conclusion: NegVQA揭示了视觉语言模型在否定理解上的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the
meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and
are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend
negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions
covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We
construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated
versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20
state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models
struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop
compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover
a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades
performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals
critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future
VLM development. Project page available at

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StrucSum improves zero-shot summarization in LLMs by incorporating structural signals via three strategies, enhancing summary quality and factual consistency without training.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with document structure and salient information in long texts for summarization. StrucSum addresses this by leveraging structural signals to guide the summarization process.

Method: StrucSum uses three strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for input reduction.

Result: Experiments show StrucSum improves summary quality and factual consistency, with notable gains of 19.2 and 9.7 points on ArXiv for FactCC and SummaC metrics.

Conclusion: Structure-aware prompting is a simple and effective method for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, requiring no training or task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot
summarization, but often struggle to model document structure and identify
salient information in long texts. In this work, we introduce StrucSum, a
training-free prompting framework that enhances LLM reasoning through
sentence-level graph structures. StrucSum injects structural signals into
prompts via three targeted strategies: Neighbor-Aware Prompting (NAP) for local
context, Centrality-Aware Prompting (CAP) for importance estimation, and
Centrality-Guided Masking (CGM) for efficient input reduction. Experiments on
ArXiv, PubMed, and Multi-News demonstrate that StrucSum consistently improves
both summary quality and factual consistency over unsupervised baselines and
vanilla prompting. Notably, on ArXiv, it boosts FactCC and SummaC by 19.2 and
9.7 points, indicating stronger alignment between summaries and source content.
These findings suggest that structure-aware prompting is a simple yet effective
approach for zero-shot extractive summarization with LLMs, without any training
or task-specific tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了四款先进的大型语言模型（LLM）在三个论点挖掘任务上的表现，结果显示LLM在特定主题的论点挖掘中表现优秀，但仍存在长文本、复杂内容和情感语言的局限性。

Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM在自动化分析和挖掘在线评论中预定义论点的能力，尤其是在争议性话题（如堕胎）上的表现。

Method: 使用包含2000多条评论的数据集，评估四款LLM在三个论点挖掘任务上的表现，包括定量分析和详细错误分析。

Result: LLM在论点挖掘任务中表现良好，尤其是大模型和经过微调的模型，但在处理长文本、复杂内容和情感语言时存在系统性不足。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化论点分析方面具有潜力，但当前仍存在局限性，特别是在内容审核和意见分析等下游应用中需谨慎。

Abstract: Automated large-scale analysis of public discussions around contested issues
like abortion requires detecting and understanding the use of arguments. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in language processing tasks,
their performance in mining topic-specific, pre-defined arguments in online
comments remains underexplored. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on three
argument mining tasks using datasets comprising over 2,000 opinion comments
across six polarizing topics. Quantitative evaluation suggests an overall
strong performance across the three tasks, especially for large and fine-tuned
LLMs, albeit at a significant environmental cost. However, a detailed error
analysis revealed systematic shortcomings on long and nuanced comments and
emotionally charged language, raising concerns for downstream applications like
content moderation or opinion analysis. Our results highlight both the promise
and current limitations of LLMs for automated argument analysis in online
comments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSE-Bench是首个评估大语言模型（LLM）在健康、安全与环境（HSE）合规评估能力的基准数据集，揭示了LLM依赖语义匹配而非原则性推理的局限性，并提出专家推理提示技术（RoE）改进其表现。

Motivation: 动态实时决策在HSE合规评估中至关重要，但LLM在领域知识及结构化法律推理上的能力尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建HSE-Bench数据集（含1000+问题，基于IRAC流程），评估多种提示策略及10余种LLM，并提出RoE提示技术模拟专家推理。

Result: 当前LLM表现虽好，但依赖语义匹配，缺乏系统法律推理；RoE技术能显著提升其合规评估准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在HSE合规推理中的不足，RoE为其改进提供了方向，呼吁进一步研究。

Abstract: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) compliance assessment demands dynamic
real-time decision-making under complicated regulations and complex
human-machine-environment interactions. While large language models (LLMs) hold
significant potential for decision intelligence and contextual dialogue, their
capacity for domain-specific knowledge in HSE and structured legal reasoning
remains underexplored. We introduce HSE-Bench, the first benchmark dataset
designed to evaluate the HSE compliance assessment capabilities of LLM.
HSE-Bench comprises over 1,000 manually curated questions drawn from
regulations, court cases, safety exams, and fieldwork videos, and integrates a
reasoning flow based on Issue spotting, rule Recall, rule Application, and rule
Conclusion (IRAC) to assess the holistic reasoning pipeline. We conduct
extensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,
including foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The
results show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their
capabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning
grounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native
reasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE
compliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting
technique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the
reasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a
more accurate unified decision. We hope our study highlights reasoning gaps in
LLMs for HSE compliance and inspires further research on related tasks.

TL;DR: ToMAP 是一种通过结合两个心智理论模块来增强语言模型说服力的新方法，显著提升了模型的对手意识和多样性。

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在心智理论推理方面表现不足，限制了其说服力和对手意识的多样性。

Method: 采用两个心智理论模块，结合文本编码器和MLP分类器预测对手立场，并通过强化学习生成更有效的论点。

Result: ToMAP 在仅含30亿参数的情况下，性能超越更大的基线模型（如GPT-4o），相对提升39.4%。

Conclusion: ToMAP 通过增强对手意识和多样性，展现出开发更具说服力语言代理的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion,
but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably,
while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions
proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind
(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To
address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader
(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by
incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness
and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by
prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central
claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to
predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully
designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to
analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective
arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B
parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative
gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably,
ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training,
which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature
of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ
more logical and opponent-aware strategies. These results underscore our
method's effectiveness and highlight its potential for developing more
persuasive language agents. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 该研究首次探究了在电子健康记录（EHR）领域的扩展规律，通过训练不同规模的模型，发现EHR模型与大型语言模型（LLM）具有相似的扩展行为。

Motivation: 研究动机是探索电子健康记录（EHR）领域中的扩展规律，以填补EHR数据与自然语言数据在扩展法则研究中的空白。

Method: 方法包括在MIMIC-IV数据库的患者时间序列数据上训练不同规模的Transformer架构，分析模型参数、计算资源、数据量与临床效用的关系。

Result: 结果发现EHR模型的扩展规律与LLM类似，包括抛物线IsoFLOPs曲线和幂律关系，为资源高效训练策略提供了预测性见解。

Conclusion: 结论是EHR模型展现出与LLM相似的扩展行为，为开发强大的EHR基础模型奠定了基础，有助于推动个性化医疗的发展。

Abstract: The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large
language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through
systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these
principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health
records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that
differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first
empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training
transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database
across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling
patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships
between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These
findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to
LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies.
Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models
capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized
healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VeGraph的新框架，利用LLM代理的能力分三步验证复杂声明：图表示、实体消歧和验证，在HoVer和FEVEROUS基准测试中表现优异。

Motivation: 面对复杂声明的验证挑战，传统方法因实体消歧不足而效果有限，需结合LLM的推理和理解能力提升准确性和可解释性。

Method: VeGraph分三个阶段：图表示（将声明分解为三元组图）、实体消歧（迭代交互知识库消歧）、验证（完成三元组验证）。

Result: 在Meta-Llama-3-70B模型上，VeGraph在HoVer和FEVEROUS基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VeGraph通过结构化解构和迭代消歧，显著提升复杂声明的验证能力，为LLM在事实核查中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not
only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This
task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models
(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic
structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address
this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to
resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective
disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire
verification process. To address these challenges, we propose
Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and
comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1)
Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets,
forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and
unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively
interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the
graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining
triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using
Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive
performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS,
effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data
are available for further exploitation.

TL;DR: DyePack 是一种通过后门攻击检测基准测试集污染的框架，无需模型内部信息即可识别训练中使用了测试集的模型。

Motivation: 开源的基准测试对于评估大型语言模型至关重要，但其易获取性可能导致测试集污染。DyePack 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在后门样本中嵌入随机目标，设计多后门策略，并计算精确的假阳性率（FPR）。

Result: 在多项选择题中，FPR 低至 0.000073%（MMLU-Pro）和 0.000017%（Big Bench-Hard）；开放生成任务中 FPR 为 0.127%（Alpaca）。

Conclusion: DyePack 高效检测污染，且假阳性率极低，适用于多项任务。

Abstract: Open benchmarks are essential for evaluating and advancing large language
models, offering reproducibility and transparency. However, their accessibility
makes them likely targets of test set contamination. In this work, we introduce
DyePack, a framework that leverages backdoor attacks to identify models that
used benchmark test sets during training, without requiring access to the loss,
logits, or any internal details of the model. Like how banks mix dye packs with
their money to mark robbers, DyePack mixes backdoor samples with the test data
to flag models that trained on it. We propose a principled design incorporating
multiple backdoors with stochastic targets, enabling exact false positive rate
(FPR) computation when flagging every model. This provably prevents false
accusations while providing strong evidence for every detected case of
contamination. We evaluate DyePack on five models across three datasets,
covering both multiple-choice and open-ended generation tasks. For
multiple-choice questions, it successfully detects all contaminated models with
guaranteed FPRs as low as 0.000073% on MMLU-Pro and 0.000017% on Big-Bench-Hard
using eight backdoors. For open-ended generation tasks, it generalizes well and
identifies all contaminated models on Alpaca with a guaranteed false positive
rate of just 0.127% using six backdoors.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to significant
improvements in various service domains, including search, recommendation, and
chatbot applications. However, applying state-of-the-art (SOTA) research to
industrial settings presents challenges, as it requires maintaining flexible
conversational abilities while also strictly complying with service-specific
constraints. This can be seen as two conflicting requirements due to the
probabilistic nature of LLMs. In this paper, we propose our approach to
addressing this challenge and detail the strategies we employed to overcome
their inherent limitations in real-world applications. We conduct a practical
case study of a conversational agent designed for the e-commerce domain,
detailing our implementation workflow and optimizations. Our findings provide
insights into bridging the gap between academic research and real-world
application, introducing a framework for developing scalable, controllable, and
reliable AI-driven agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于参考过滤和TF-IDF聚类（RFTC）的隐蔽后门样本检测方法，用于解决LLMs微调中的安全隐患，实验证明其优于现有基线。

Motivation: 微调含有隐蔽后门的数据集会对下游应用造成安全风险。现有方法要么无法适用于生成任务，要么可能降低生成性能或引入新触发词，亟需高效消除后门样本的方案。

Method: 结合参考模型输出的差异检测可疑样本，再通过TF-IDF聚类分析类内距离，分离污染样本（聚集紧密）和干净样本（分布分散）。

Result: 在两个机器翻译数据集和一个QA数据集上，RFTC在检测后门和模型性能上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RFTC通过参考过滤和聚类机制有效识别隐蔽后门样本，且参考模型的选择对过滤效果具有显著影响。

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets containing stealthy backdoors from publishers
poses security risks to downstream applications. Mainstream detection methods
either identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of
poisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the
stealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,
while the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.
Therefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains
an urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the
sample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances
between clean and poisoned samples. Poisoned samples tend to cluster closely
because of their specific malicious outputs, whereas clean samples are more
scattered due to their more varied responses. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
stealthy backdoor sample detection method based on Reference-Filtration and
Tfidf-Clustering mechanisms (RFTC). Specifically, we first compare the sample
response with the reference model's outputs and consider the sample suspicious
if there's a significant discrepancy. And then we perform TF-IDF clustering on
these suspicious samples to identify the true poisoned samples based on the
intra-class distance. Experiments on two machine translation datasets and one
QA dataset demonstrate that RFTC outperforms baselines in backdoor detection
and model performance. Further analysis of different reference models also
confirms the effectiveness of our Reference-Filtration.

TL;DR: 提出了CHED基准来评估知识编辑（KE）方法的上下文鲁棒性，发现现有方法在上下文存在时效果不佳。为此，提出了CoRE方法以提升上下文鲁棒性，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在评估时忽略了上下文对编辑效果的影响，可能导致实际应用中编辑失败。

Method: 开发了CHED基准测试上下文鲁棒性，并提出了CoRE方法，通过最小化隐藏状态的上下文敏感方差来增强鲁棒性。

Result: 现有KE方法在CHED上表现不佳，而CoRE显著提升了编辑成功率且不影响模型整体能力。

Conclusion: 上下文对知识编辑效果影响显著，CoRE方法有效提升了鲁棒性，为后续研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in
large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success
by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In
real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the
retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address
this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context
robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when
preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce
CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing
context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.
This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a
preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the
model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding
contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we
dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence
editing success.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无监督的Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM)方法，通过语义嵌入空间中词的邻域峰值度来估计文本的可想象性和具体性，实验表明其效果优于现有方法。

Motivation: 研究动机在于利用图像-标题数据集中的文本信号，无需依赖多模态模型或平行空间，仅通过语义嵌入空间的邻域特性来估计可想象性和具体性。

Method: 提出了一种无监督且无分布假设的Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM)，通过量化语义嵌入空间中单词邻域的峰值度来估计这两种心理语言学特性。

Result: 实验证明，NSM与人工标注的真实评分相关性更强，且在分类任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: NSM是一种有效的无监督方法，能够仅基于文本信号准确估计可想象性和具体性。

Abstract: Imageability (potential of text to evoke a mental image) and concreteness
(perceptibility of text) are two psycholinguistic properties that link visual
and semantic spaces. It is little surprise that computational methods that
estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as
collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we
work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers
sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in
particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic
embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then
propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood
Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive
experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings
than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these
properties for classification. Our code and data are available on GitHub

Motivation: 临床NLP工具在自动标注临床报告中应用渐广，但针对特定任务（如儿科胸部X光报告标注）的独立评估有限，因此需要比较不同工具的性能差异。

Method: 研究分析了95,008份儿科胸部X光报告，使用四种NLP系统提取实体和断言状态，并将印象部分实体映射至12种疾病类别和“无发现”类别。CheXpert和CheXbert提取相同的13个类别。通过Fleiss Kappa和准确性评估输出。

Result: 不同NLP系统在实体提取数量和断言分布上差异显著，SP表现最佳（76%准确率），AWS最低（50%）。CheXpert和CheXbert准确率为56%。

Conclusion: NLP工具性能差异显著，部署前需谨慎验证和审查。

Abstract: General-purpose clinical natural language processing (NLP) tools are
increasingly used for the automatic labeling of clinical reports. However,
independent evaluations for specific tasks, such as pediatric chest radiograph
(CXR) report labeling, are limited. This study compares four commercial
clinical NLP systems - Amazon Comprehend Medical (AWS), Google Healthcare NLP
(GC), Azure Clinical NLP (AZ), and SparkNLP (SP) - for entity extraction and
assertion detection in pediatric CXR reports. Additionally, CheXpert and
CheXbert, two dedicated chest radiograph report labelers, were evaluated on the
same task using CheXpert-defined labels. We analyzed 95,008 pediatric CXR
reports from a large academic pediatric hospital. Entities and assertion
statuses (positive, negative, uncertain) from the findings and impression
sections were extracted by the NLP systems, with impression section entities
mapped to 12 disease categories and a No Findings category. CheXpert and
CheXbert extracted the same 13 categories. Outputs were compared using Fleiss
Kappa and accuracy against a consensus pseudo-ground truth. Significant
differences were found in the number of extracted entities and assertion
distributions across NLP systems. SP extracted 49,688 unique entities, GC
16,477, AZ 31,543, and AWS 27,216. Assertion accuracy across models averaged
around 62%, with SP highest (76%) and AWS lowest (50%). CheXpert and CheXbert
achieved 56% accuracy. Considerable variability in performance highlights the
need for careful validation and review before deploying NLP tools for clinical
report labeling.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了人类与AI交互过程中产生的‘面向机器的英语’（MFE），揭示了其语法、词汇和语用简化特征，虽然提高了解析准确性但牺牲了语言的自然流畅性。

Motivation: 探讨AI交互如何影响语言使用，特别是MFE的演变，以理解人类为适应机器而做出的语言调整。

Method: 基于双语（韩语/英语）的语音和文本产品测试会话，采用自然语言声明提示（NLD-P）进行自反性草拟，并进行主题分析。

Result: 识别出MFE的五种特征：冗余清晰度、指令语法、受限词汇、平坦语调和单一意图结构，虽提升了执行准确性但压缩了表达范围。

Conclusion: MFE的演变揭示了沟通效率与语言丰富性之间的张力，呼吁进一步方法学阐述和实证验证。

Abstract: Machine-Facing English (MFE) is an emergent register shaped by the adaptation
of everyday language to the expanding presence of AI interlocutors. Drawing on
register theory (Halliday 1985, 2006), enregisterment (Agha 2003), audience
design (Bell 1984), and interactional pragmatics (Giles & Ogay 2007), this
study traces how sustained human-AI interaction normalizes syntactic rigidity,
pragmatic simplification, and hyper-explicit phrasing - features that enhance
machine parseability at the expense of natural fluency. Our analysis is
grounded in qualitative observations from bilingual (Korean/English) voice- and
text-based product testing sessions, with reflexive drafting conducted using
Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) under human curation. Thematic
analysis identifies five recurrent traits - redundant clarity, directive
syntax, controlled vocabulary, flattened prosody, and single-intent structuring
- that improve execution accuracy but compress expressive range. MFE's
evolution highlights a persistent tension between communicative efficiency and
linguistic richness, raising design challenges for conversational interfaces
and pedagogical considerations for multilingual users. We conclude by
underscoring the need for comprehensive methodological exposition and future
empirical validation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从社交媒体评论中生成方面术语的方法(CAT-G)，通过多语言大模型和监督微调提升模型对评论的理解，并在多语言测试集上验证了其有效性。

Motivation: 社交媒体评论语言自由且主题分散，给下游NLP任务（如评论聚类、摘要和观点分析）带来挑战，因此需要一种细粒度的方法来生成评论的方面术语。

Method: 利用多语言大语言模型进行监督微调，结合DPO（Direct Preference Optimization）对齐模型预测与人类预期，生成评论方面术语(CAT-G)。

Result: 方法在两项NLP任务中提升了社交媒体评论的理解效果，并贡献了首个多语言CAT-G测试集（英语、中文、马来语、印尼语）。

Conclusion: CAT-G方法有效提升了模型对社交媒体评论的细粒度理解，多语言测试集为不同语言能力的LLM性能对比提供了基础。

Abstract: The inherent nature of social media posts, characterized by the freedom of
language use with a disjointed array of diverse opinions and topics, poses
significant challenges to downstream NLP tasks such as comment clustering,
comment summarization, and social media opinion analysis. To address this, we
propose a granular level of identifying and generating aspect terms from
individual comments to guide model attention. Specifically, we leverage
multilingual large language models with supervised fine-tuning for comment
aspect term generation (CAT-G), further aligning the model's predictions with
human expectations through DPO. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing the comprehension of social media discourse on two NLP tasks.
Moreover, this paper contributes the first multilingual CAT-G test set on
English, Chinese, Malay, and Bahasa Indonesian. As LLM capabilities vary among
languages, this test set allows for a comparative analysis of performance
across languages with varying levels of LLM proficiency.

Conclusion: EL4NER证明了在ICL范式下使用小型开源LLM的可行性，兼具参数效率与性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) technique based on Large Language Models (LLMs) has
gained prominence in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks for its lower
computing resource consumption, less manual labeling overhead, and stronger
generalizability. Nevertheless, most ICL-based NER methods depend on
large-parameter LLMs: the open-source models demand substantial computational
resources for deployment and inference, while the closed-source ones incur high
API costs, raise data-privacy concerns, and hinder community collaboration. To
address this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity
Recognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple
open-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks
at less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three
key components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that
facilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel
span-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration
retrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a
self-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble
process. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from
diverse domains. Our experimental results indicate that EL4NER surpasses most
closed-source, large-parameter LLM-based methods at a lower parameter cost and
even attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among ICL-based methods on
certain datasets. These results show the parameter efficiency of EL4NER and
underscore the feasibility of employing open-source, small-parameter LLMs
within the ICL paradigm for NER tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGRouter 是一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）的路由机制，通过动态文档嵌入和对比学习优化 LLM 选择，显著提升任务表现。

Motivation: 现有路由方法基于静态知识表示，在 RAG 场景下表现不佳，而动态检索文档影响 LLM 回答能力，需要新的路由框架。

Method: 提出 RAGRouter，结合文档嵌入和 RAG 能力嵌入，通过对比学习捕捉知识表示变化，实现智能路由决策。

Result: 实验显示 RAGRouter 平均比最佳单 LLM 提升 3.61%，比现有路由方法高 3.29%-9.33%，并在低延迟下实现高效性能权衡。

Conclusion: RAGRouter 通过动态路由机制有效解决了 RAG 场景下的模型选择问题，显著提升任务性能与效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improves the performance
of Large Language Models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, varying
response quality across LLMs under RAG necessitates intelligent routing
mechanisms, which select the most suitable model for each query from multiple
retrieval-augmented LLMs via a dedicated router model. We observe that external
documents dynamically affect LLMs' ability to answer queries, while existing
routing methods, which rely on static parametric knowledge representations,
exhibit suboptimal performance in RAG scenarios. To address this, we formally
define the new retrieval-augmented LLM routing problem, incorporating the
influence of retrieved documents into the routing framework. We propose
RAGRouter, a RAG-aware routing design, which leverages document embeddings and
RAG capability embeddings with contrastive learning to capture knowledge
representation shifts and enable informed routing decisions. Extensive
experiments on diverse knowledge-intensive tasks and retrieval settings show
that RAGRouter outperforms the best individual LLM by 3.61% on average and
existing routing methods by 3.29%-9.33%. With an extended score-threshold-based
mechanism, it also achieves strong performance-efficiency trade-offs under
low-latency constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小型语言模型在代码生成中通过自我纠正提升输出质量的能力有限，CoCoS方法通过在线强化学习显著改善了这一能力。

Motivation: 探究小型语言模型是否能够通过自我反思有效改进代码生成输出。

Method: 提出CoCoS方法，采用在线强化学习目标，设计累积奖励函数和细粒度奖励机制。

Result: CoCoS在1B规模模型上，MBPP和HumanEval任务分别提升35.8%和27.7%。

Conclusion: CoCoS有效提升小型语言模型的多轮代码纠正能力。

Abstract: Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing
language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive
refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that
incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as
training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities.
However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their
outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that
smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both
self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach
designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code
correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective
that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while
progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach
features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the
entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn
correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response
quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With
1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on
HumanEval compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: 引入SNS-Bench-VL，一个用于评估视觉-语言大模型在社交网络多模态任务中表现的基准测试。

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注纯文本任务，缺乏对现代社交网络中多模态上下文的覆盖，因此需要开发涵盖多模态任务的评估工具。

Method: 设计了包含8种多模态任务的SNS-Bench-VL，包括笔记理解、用户参与度分析等，提供4,001对问题-答案数据，并评估了25个领先的多模态大模型。

Result: 评估结果表明现有模型在多模态社交上下文理解中仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: SNS-Bench-VL有望推动未来研究，以开发更具鲁棒性和上下文感知的多模态智能技术。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of visual and textual content in Social
Networking Services (SNS), evaluating the multimodal capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing user experience, content
understanding, and platform intelligence. Existing benchmarks primarily focus
on text-centric tasks, lacking coverage of the multimodal contexts prevalent in
modern SNS ecosystems. In this paper, we introduce SNS-Bench-VL, a
comprehensive multimodal benchmark designed to assess the performance of
Vision-Language LLMs in real-world social media scenarios. SNS-Bench-VL
incorporates images and text across 8 multimodal tasks, including note
comprehension, user engagement analysis, information retrieval, and
personalized recommendation. It comprises 4,001 carefully curated multimodal
question-answer pairs, covering single-choice, multiple-choice, and open-ended
tasks. We evaluate over 25 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs, analyzing their
performance across tasks. Our findings highlight persistent challenges in
multimodal social context comprehension. We hope SNS-Bench-VL will inspire
future research towards robust, context-aware, and human-aligned multimodal
intelligence for next-generation social networking services.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了将最小贝叶斯风险（MBR）解码应用于文档级文本生成任务的改进方法MBR-OT，通过Wasserstein距离计算文档效用，并在多个任务中表现优于标准MBR。

Motivation: 文档级文本生成任务因需要理解更长的上下文而较句子级任务更具挑战性，现有的MBR解码效用函数多针对句子设计，限制了其在文档级任务的效果。

Method: 提出MBR-OT，利用Wasserstein距离结合句子级效用函数计算文档效用。

Result: 实验表明MBR-OT在文档级机器翻译、文本简化和密集图像描述任务中优于标准MBR。

Conclusion: MBR-OT通过优化效用计算方式，有效提升了文档级文本生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Document-level text generation tasks are known to be more difficult than
sentence-level text generation tasks as they require the understanding of
longer context to generate high-quality texts. In this paper, we investigate
the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text
generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the
output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs.
Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of
sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text
generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for
evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant
of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document
using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the
performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level
machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks. Our

TL;DR: 为了提高少样本关系抽取任务的性能，研究提出了通过改进大语言模型生成训练样本的多样性和正确性，使用了ICL提示和DPO微调方法，实验表明这些方法能提升数据质量，并发现非LLM模型使用生成的样本训练效果更佳。

Motivation: 研究中发现直接用大语言模型生成的关系抽取任务样本结构相似度高、表达方式单一，影响了训练数据的质量和多样性。

Method: 采用了两种方法：1）在ICL提示中直接加入指令以提高样本多样性；2）通过DPO微调大语言模型以生成更多样化的训练样本。

Result: 实验显示，这两种方法均能有效提升生成样本的质量，且用这些样本训练的非LLM关系抽取模型性能优于直接用大语言模型进行关系抽取。

Conclusion: 通过改进样本生成方法，可提升关系抽取任务的训练数据质量，从而增强模型性能。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially
be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many
problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation
Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may
easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a
limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of
entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the
diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also
maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar
samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts.
Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample
generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on
commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of
the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly
performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated
samples may lead to better performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出Alignment Data Map工具，通过GPT-4o分析偏好数据，仅需33%的高质量数据即可实现与全数据集相当或更好的对齐效果，同时能诊断数据质量。

Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，制约了大语言模型与人类价值观的对齐可扩展性。

Method: 利用GPT-4o作为代理计算LLM生成响应的对齐分数，基于均值和方差构建Alignment Data Map，筛选高质量样本。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用33%的高均值、低方差区域数据，性能可媲美或超过全数据集，并能有效识别低效或错误标注样本。

Conclusion: Alignment Data Map显著提升了数据收集效率，无需显式标注即可优化LLM对齐，同时具备数据集诊断能力。

Abstract: Human preference data plays a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human values. However, collecting such data is often expensive and
inefficient, posing a significant scalability challenge. To address this, we
introduce Alignment Data Map, a GPT-4o-assisted tool for analyzing and
diagnosing preference data. Using GPT-4o as a proxy for LLM alignment, we
compute alignment scores for LLM-generated responses to instructions from
existing preference datasets. These scores are then used to construct an
Alignment Data Map based on their mean and variance. Our experiments show that
using only 33 percent of the data, specifically samples in the high-mean,
low-variance region, achieves performance comparable to or better than using
the entire dataset. This finding suggests that the Alignment Data Map can
significantly improve data collection efficiency by identifying high-quality
samples for LLM alignment without requiring explicit annotations. Moreover, the
Alignment Data Map can diagnose existing preference datasets. Our analysis
shows that it effectively detects low-impact or potentially misannotated
samples. Source code is available online.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个两阶段后训练流程MedE²，通过文本和多模态数据增强医疗领域的多模态推理能力，显著提升了模型在医疗多模态基准上的表现。

Motivation: 虽然多模态推理模型在数学和科学领域取得了成功，但医疗领域的应用仍不足。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了MedE²，以增强医疗领域的多模态推理能力。

Method: MedE²分为两个阶段：第一阶段用2000个精确编排的文本样本微调模型以激发推理行为；第二阶段用1500个多模态医疗案例进一步提升模型推理能力，并与多模态医疗推理偏好对齐。

Result: 实验表明，MedE²显著提升了医疗多模态模型的推理性能，在多个基准上优于基线模型，且在大模型和推理扩展条件下验证了其鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: MedE²通过两阶段训练有效提升了医疗领域的多模态推理能力，为复杂医疗任务的解决提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Effective clinical decision-making depends on iterative, multimodal reasoning
across diverse sources of evidence. The recent emergence of multimodal
reasoning models has significantly transformed the landscape of solving complex
tasks. Although such models have achieved notable success in mathematics and
science, their application to medical domains remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose \textit{MedE$^2$}, a two-stage post-training pipeline that
elicits and then enhances multimodal reasoning for medical domains. In Stage-I,
we fine-tune models using 2,000 text-only data samples containing precisely
orchestrated reasoning demonstrations to elicit reasoning behaviors. In
Stage-II, we further enhance the model's reasoning capabilities using 1,500
rigorously curated multimodal medical cases, aligning model reasoning outputs
with our proposed multimodal medical reasoning preference. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of \textit{MedE$^2$} in
improving the reasoning performance of medical multimodal models. Notably,
models trained with \textit{MedE$^2$} consistently outperform baselines across
multiple medical multimodal benchmarks. Additional validation on larger models
and under inference-time scaling further confirms the robustness and practical
utility of our approach.

Method: 引入ContextQFormer模块用内存块增强上下文表示，并构建TMDialog数据集支持预训练与评估。

Result: ContextQFormer在TMDialog上比基线模型性能提升2%-4%。

Conclusion: ContextQFormer和TMDialog有效提升多模态长上下文对话能力，推动相关研究。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing
open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn
interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first
introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a
memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information.
Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new
multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training,
instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared
with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer
conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue.
In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and
experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of
2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Motivation: 验证LLMs在数学、编程之外的实用领域（如历史语言学）的抽象推理能力是否普适，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 开发自动化流水线动态生成可控难度的基准测试（含近1k实例），解决现有推理基准的扩展性和数据污染问题。

Result: 当前最优模型（Claude-3.7-Sonnet）通过率仅54%，表明LLMs在历史语言学等领域的推理仍存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: LCoT LLMs在历史语言学类推理任务中表现不足，需进一步提升通用推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, long chain of thought (LCoT), Large Language Models (LLMs), have
taken the machine learning world by storm with their breathtaking reasoning
capabilities. However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models
general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which
has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a
historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as
Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically
generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to
tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks
are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k
instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the
best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating
that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in
historical linguistics as well as many other domains.

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练，资源消耗低，能有效提升LLM在多任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional performance across
multiple crosslingual NLP tasks, including machine translation (MT). However,
persistent challenges remain in addressing context-sensitive units (CSUs), such
as polysemous words. These CSUs not only affect the local translation accuracy
of LLMs, but also affect LLMs' understanding capability for sentences and
tasks, and even lead to translation failure. To address this problem, we
propose a simple but effective method to enhance LLMs' MT capabilities by
acquiring CSUs and applying semantic focus. Specifically, we dynamically
analyze and identify translation challenges, then incorporate them into LLMs in
a structured manner to mitigate mistranslations or misunderstandings of CSUs
caused by information flattening. Efficiently activate LLMs to identify and
apply relevant knowledge from its vast data pool in this way, ensuring more
accurate translations for translating difficult terms. On a benchmark dataset
of MT, our proposed method achieved competitive performance compared to
multiple existing open-sourced MT baseline models. It demonstrates
effectiveness and robustness across multiple language pairs, including both
similar language pairs and distant language pairs. Notably, the proposed method
requires no additional model training and enhances LLMs' performance across
multiple NLP tasks with minimal resource consumption.

Conclusion: 预训练模型能有效提升专业领域双语词典构建效果，尤其在数据稀缺和上下文敏感的领域。

Abstract: Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) is generally based on common domain data to
obtain monolingual word embedding, and by aligning the monolingual word
embeddings to obtain the cross-lingual embeddings which are used to get the
word translation pairs. In this paper, we propose a new task of BLI, which is
to use the monolingual corpus of the general domain and target domain to
extract domain-specific bilingual dictionaries. Motivated by the ability of
Pre-trained models, we propose a method to get better word embeddings that
build on the recent work on BLI. This way, we introduce the Code Switch(Qin et
al., 2020) firstly in the cross-domain BLI task, which can match differit is
yet to be seen whether these methods are suitable for bilingual lexicon
extraction in professional fields. As we can see in table 1, the classic and
efficient BLI approach, Muse and Vecmap, perform much worse on the Medical
dataset than on the Wiki dataset. On one hand, the specialized domain data set
is relatively smaller compared to the generic domain data set generally, and
specialized words have a lower frequency, which will directly affect the
translation quality of bilingual dictionaries. On the other hand, static word
embeddings are widely used for BLI, however, in some specific fields, the
meaning of words is greatly influenced by context, in this case, using only
static word embeddings may lead to greater bias. ent strategies in different
contexts, making the model more suitable for this task. Experimental results
show that our method can improve performances over robust BLI baselines on
three specific domains by averagely improving 0.78 points.

Motivation: 传统词袋方法（如LDA）在处理文学文本时效果不佳，因其注重感官细节而非抽象描述。需一种能捕捉叙事深层主题的方法。

Method: 使用生成式语言模型对段落进行‘重述’，转化为概念性描述，再应用LDA进行主题建模。

Conclusion: Retell为文学主题建模提供了一种简单有效的方法，尤其在文化分析中潜力显著。

Abstract: Conventional bag-of-words approaches for topic modeling, like latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA), struggle with literary text. Literature challenges
lexical methods because narrative language focuses on immersive sensory details
instead of abstractive description or exposition: writers are advised to "show,
don't tell." We propose Retell, a simple, accessible topic modeling approach
for literature. Here, we prompt resource-efficient, generative language models
(LMs) to tell what passages show, thereby translating narratives' surface forms
into higher-level concepts and themes. By running LDA on LMs' retellings of
passages, we can obtain more precise and informative topics than by running LDA
alone or by directly asking LMs to list topics. To investigate the potential of
our method for cultural analytics, we compare our method's outputs to
expert-guided annotations in a case study on racial/cultural identity in high

Abstract: We present ZIPA, a family of efficient speech models that advances the
state-of-the-art performance of crosslinguistic phone recognition. We first
curated IPAPack++, a large-scale multilingual speech corpus with 17,132 hours
of normalized phone transcriptions and a novel evaluation set capturing unseen
languages and sociophonetic variation. With the large-scale training data,
ZIPA, including transducer (ZIPA-T) and CTC-based (ZIPA-CR) variants, leverage
the efficient Zipformer backbones and outperform existing phone recognition
systems with much fewer parameters. Further scaling via noisy student training
on 11,000 hours of pseudo-labeled multilingual data yields further improvement.
While ZIPA achieves strong performance on benchmarks, error analysis reveals
persistent limitations in modeling sociophonetic diversity, underscoring
challenges for future research.

Conclusion: 实验证明Map&Make在结构化摘要任务中性能优越，且通过消融研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Transforming dense, detailed, unstructured text into an interpretable and
summarised table, also colloquially known as Text-to-Table generation, is an
essential task for information retrieval. Current methods, however, miss out on
how and what complex information to extract; they also lack the ability to
infer data from the text. In this paper, we introduce a versatile approach,
Map&Make, which "dissects" text into propositional atomic statements. This
facilitates granular decomposition to extract the latent schema. The schema is
then used to populate the tables that capture the qualitative nuances and the
quantitative facts in the original text. Our approach is tested against two
challenging datasets, Rotowire, renowned for its complex and multi-table
schema, and Livesum, which demands numerical aggregation. By carefully
identifying and correcting hallucination errors in Rotowire, we aim to achieve
a cleaner and more reliable benchmark. We evaluate our method rigorously on a
comprehensive suite of comparative and referenceless metrics. Our findings
demonstrate significant improvement results across both datasets with better
interpretability in Text-to-Table generation. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and analyses, we investigate the factors contributing to
superior performance and validate the practicality of our framework in
structured summarization tasks.

TL;DR: Infinite-Instruct是一个自动化框架，通过‘逆向构建’和‘反馈构建’方法合成高质量的代码问答对，提升大语言模型的代码生成能力，实验显示显著性能提升。

Motivation: 传统代码指令数据合成方法存在多样性和逻辑性问题，需要一种能提升合成问题内部逻辑和代码质量的框架。

Method: 采用‘逆向构建’将代码片段转化为多样化编程问题，通过‘反馈构建’构建知识图谱增强问题逻辑，并利用跨语言静态代码分析过滤无效样本。

Conclusion: Infinite-Instruct为编程领域的大语言模型训练提供了可扩展的解决方案，并开源了实验数据集。

Abstract: Traditional code instruction data synthesis methods suffer from limited
diversity and poor logic. We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated
framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to
enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and
the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code
snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding
Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge
graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal
logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid
samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code
generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance
improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter
models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we
achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct.
Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming.
We open-source the datasets used in the experiments, including both unfiltered
versions and filtered versions via static analysis. The data are available at

Motivation: 现有的词级质量估计（WQE）方法通常成本高昂，依赖大型语言模型或大量人工标注数据，作者希望探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 研究通过语言模型的可解释性与不确定性量化技术，结合12种翻译方向和14项度量标准，评估无监督指标和监督方法的表现。

Conclusion: 研究强调了无监督指标的潜力，并指出需要改进监督方法以应对标签不确定性，同时呼吁更稳健的评估实践。

Abstract: Word-level quality estimation (WQE) aims to automatically identify
fine-grained error spans in machine-translated outputs and has found many uses,
including assisting translators during post-editing. Modern WQE techniques are
often expensive, involving prompting of large language models or ad-hoc
training on large amounts of human-labeled data. In this work, we investigate
efficient alternatives exploiting recent advances in language model
interpretability and uncertainty quantification to identify translation errors
from the inner workings of translation models. In our evaluation spanning 14
metrics across 12 translation directions, we quantify the impact of human label
variation on metric performance by using multiple sets of human labels. Our
results highlight the untapped potential of unsupervised metrics, the
shortcomings of supervised methods when faced with label uncertainty, and the
brittleness of single-annotator evaluation practices.

Conclusion: MAEL框架通过跨任务经验学习显著提升多智能体协作的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown remarkable
progress in solving complex tasks through collaborative reasoning and
inter-agent critique. However, existing approaches typically treat each task in
isolation, resulting in redundant computations and limited generalization
across structurally similar tasks. To address this, we introduce multi-agent
cross-task experiential learning (MAEL), a novel framework that endows
LLM-driven agents with explicit cross-task learning and experience
accumulation. We model the task-solving workflow on a graph-structured
multi-agent collaboration network, where agents propagate information and
coordinate via explicit connectivity. During the experiential learning phase,
we quantify the quality for each step in the task-solving workflow and store
the resulting rewards along with the corresponding inputs and outputs into each
agent's individual experience pool. During inference, agents retrieve
high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the
effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and
efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets
demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences
effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions
on current tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工或时间成本高的问题，探索LLMs能否模仿人类认知能力自主迁移经验。

Method: 设计了自主经验转移框架，实验在13个数据集上进行验证。

Result: 框架有效提升了LLMs的性能，并对框架各模块进行了详细分析。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅降低了经验获取成本，还为LLMs的泛化提供了新路径。

Abstract: Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving
experiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods
rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each
task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user
queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience
transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive
intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to
newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of
experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel
path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets
demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs.
Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.

Conclusion: 通过细粒度推理步骤置信度校准，MMBoundary有效提升MLLMs的推理链自我修正能力，减少幻觉问题，推动多模态推理研究。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
significant progress but continue to face inherent challenges in multimodal
reasoning, which requires multi-level (e.g., perception, reasoning) and
multi-granular (e.g., multi-step reasoning chain) advanced inferencing. Prior
work on estimating model confidence tends to focus on the overall response for
training and calibration, but fails to assess confidence in each reasoning
step, leading to undesirable hallucination snowballing. In this work, we
present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary
awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve
this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal
self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM
reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of
self-rewarded confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression
warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward
functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at
each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical
results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across
diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in
multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task
performance.

Motivation: 现有MCTS方法在开放式对话（如心理辅导）中因缺乏明确正确性标准而易产生不恰当回应，需一种能适应主观性需求的方法。

Method: 提出MCTSr-Zero框架，引入领域对齐（目标转向符合领域原则的对话轨迹）、再生和元提示适应机制（拓宽策略探索）。

Result: 生成的PsyLLM模型在PsyEval基准测试中达到最优性能，验证了MCTSr-Zero在生成高质量、原则对齐数据方面的有效性。

Conclusion: MCTSr-Zero成功解决了LLM在复杂心理标准下保持一致性的挑战，适用于人本领域对话生成。

Abstract: The integration of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant success in structured, problem-oriented
tasks. However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those
in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with
objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on
subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment
with human preferences, for which strict "correctness" criteria are
ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce
misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS
framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation
is "domain alignment", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined
end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain
principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates
"Regeneration" and "Meta-Prompt Adaptation" mechanisms to substantially broaden
exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial
dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by
generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM.
We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological
counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating
MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned
conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge
of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.

Motivation: 现有 CQA 评估过于依赖固定输出格式和客观指标，无法满足实际图表分析的复杂需求。

Method: 提出了 ChartMind 基准和 ChartLLM 框架，专注于提取关键上下文元素和增强多模态模型的推理能力。

Result: 在 ChartMind 和三个公开基准上的评估显示，ChartLLM 显著优于指令跟随、OCR增强和思维链这三种常见 CQA 范式。

Conclusion: 灵活的图表理解对实际 CQA 至关重要，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Chart question answering (CQA) has become a critical multimodal task for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. While early
approaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or
leveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid
output formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world
demands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a
new benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind
covers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports
open-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging
the gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.
Furthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,
that focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and
enhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive
evaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14
mainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the
previous three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and
chain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding
for real-world CQA. These findings suggest new directions for developing more
robust chart reasoning in future research.

Abstract: Approaches form the foundation for conducting scientific research. Querying
approaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,
and without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face
significant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.
Constructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these
dimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies
approach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four
distinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,
and lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on
approach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches
are identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure
to represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a
tree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level
similarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the
similarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to
construct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging
each approach component or class with its most similar approach component or
class in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering
process indicate the common semantics of the step components within the
approach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within
the class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a
multi-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the
multi-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space
ensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces
search space through a class-based query mechanism.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）中生成文本时对信息完整性的潜在威胁，尤其是在教育、社交媒体和学术领域。

Method: 使用多种生成策略（标题生成、内容感知生成、文本优化）和模型架构（ALLaM、Jais、Llama、GPT-4），结合语言学分析和BERT检测模型。

Result: 发现LLMs生成的阿拉伯语文本具有可检测的特征，检测模型在正式语境中F1-score高达99.9%。

Conclusion: 为阿拉伯语信息完整性提供了基础，展示了跨领域检测的挑战和潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in
generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for
information integrity across critical domains, including education, social
media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns,
compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This
challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource
languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of
Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies
(generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement)
across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic,
and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive
linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic
text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we
demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs,
with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different
contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models
that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\%
F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain
analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the
literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most
comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely
combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and
in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a
foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems
essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

TL;DR: Sentinel 是一个轻量级的句子级别压缩框架，通过利用现成的小规模语言模型的解码器注意力来识别句子相关性，实现高效、便携的检索增强生成。

Motivation: 检索增强生成（RAG）中检索到的片段通常冗长、嘈杂或超出输入限制，现有压缩方法需要训练专用模型，成本高且不便于移植。

Method: Sentinel 将上下文过滤任务重新定义为基于注意力的理解任务，利用轻量级分类器探测现成小规模语言模型的解码器注意力来识别句子相关性。

Result: 在 LongBench 基准测试中，Sentinel 实现了 5 倍的压缩，同时 QA 性能与 7B 规模的压缩系统相当。

Conclusion: 通过探测原生注意力信号可以实现快速、有效且问题感知的上下文压缩。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with external context, but retrieved passages are often lengthy, noisy, or
exceed input limits. Existing compression methods typically require supervised
training of dedicated compression models, increasing cost and reducing
portability. We propose Sentinel, a lightweight sentence-level compression
framework that reframes context filtering as an attention-based understanding
task. Rather than training a compression model, Sentinel probes decoder
attention from an off-the-shelf 0.5B proxy LLM using a lightweight classifier
to identify sentence relevance. Empirically, we find that query-context
relevance estimation is consistent across model scales, with 0.5B proxies
closely matching the behaviors of larger models. On the LongBench benchmark,
Sentinel achieves up to 5$\times$ compression while matching the QA performance
of 7B-scale compression systems. Our results suggest that probing native
attention signals enables fast, effective, and question-aware context
compression. Code available at: https://github.com/yzhangchuck/Sentinel.

Result: 所有知识编辑方法在性能上均有所下降，且在文本级指标上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ScEdit基准揭示了知识编辑的挑战性，并为其实际应用提供了新的评估框架。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) has gained increasing attention, yet current KE tasks
remain relatively simple. Under current evaluation frameworks, many editing
methods achieve exceptionally high scores, sometimes nearing perfection.
However, few studies integrate KE into real-world application scenarios (e.g.,
recent interest in LLM-as-agent). To support our analysis, we introduce a novel
script-based benchmark -- ScEdit (Script-based Knowledge Editing Benchmark) --
which encompasses both counterfactual and temporal edits. We integrate
token-level and text-level evaluation methods, comprehensively analyzing
existing KE techniques. The benchmark extends traditional fact-based
("What"-type question) evaluation to action-based ("How"-type question)
evaluation. We observe that all KE methods exhibit a drop in performance on
established metrics and face challenges on text-level metrics, indicating a
challenging task. Our benchmark is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成长文本时的准确性，发现随着文本长度增加，准确率下降，并提出一个自动评估框架验证这一现象，主要原因是知识耗尽。

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在长文本生成中广泛应用，但其事实错误会影响可靠性，而文本长度对准确性的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入一个自动的双层长文本事实性评估框架，并通过控制实验验证长度与准确性的关系，检验三种假设（错误传播、长上下文、知识耗尽）。

Result: 实验表明，文本越长，事实准确性越低，主要原因是知识耗尽，而非错误传播或长上下文。

Conclusion: 长文本生成中的事实性下降主要由知识耗尽引起，建议未来关注如何缓解这一问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for long-form text generation.
However, factual errors in the responses would undermine their reliability.
Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on
factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form
factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human
annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct
controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual
precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon,
we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and
facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model
gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual
degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
are increasingly deployed in industry applications, yet their reliability
remains hampered by challenges in detecting hallucinations. While supervised
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that leverage LLM hidden states -- such as
activation tracing and representation analysis -- show promise, their
dependence on extensively annotated datasets limits scalability in real-world
applications. This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of data annotation
by investigating the feasibility of reducing training data requirements for two
SOTA hallucination detection frameworks: Lookback Lens, which analyzes
attention head dynamics, and probing-based approaches, which decode internal
model representations. We propose a methodology combining efficient
classification algorithms with dimensionality reduction techniques to minimize
sample size demands while maintaining competitive performance. Evaluations on
standardized question-answering RAG benchmarks show that our approach achieves
performance comparable to strong proprietary LLM-based baselines with only 250
training samples. These results highlight the potential of lightweight,
data-efficient paradigms for industrial deployment, particularly in
annotation-constrained scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD)问题，针对长文本和类别不平衡的挑战，提出PaMA框架，利用LLMs提取事件模式并通过排名-过滤-挖掘流程优化原型表示，在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Motivation: 当前文本GCD方法在现实场景中验证不足，尤其是在长文本和类别不平衡的情况下表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出PaMA框架，利用LLMs提取和优化事件模式，并通过排名-过滤-挖掘流程平衡原型表示。

Result: 在EC-GCD基准测试中，PaMA比之前的方法提升高达12.58%的H-score，同时在基础GCD数据集上保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PaMA成功解决了EC-GCD中的挑战，为处理长文本和类别不平衡问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify both known and novel
categories using partially labeled data that contains only known classes.
Despite achieving strong performance on existing benchmarks, current textual
GCD methods lack sufficient validation in realistic settings. We introduce
Event-Centric GCD (EC-GCD), characterized by long, complex narratives and
highly imbalanced class distributions, posing two main challenges: (1)
divergent clustering versus classification groupings caused by subjective
criteria, and (2) Unfair alignment for minority classes. To tackle these, we
propose PaMA, a framework leveraging LLMs to extract and refine event patterns
for improved cluster-class alignment. Additionally, a ranking-filtering-mining
pipeline ensures balanced representation of prototypes across imbalanced
categories. Evaluations on two EC-GCD benchmarks, including a newly constructed
Scam Report dataset, demonstrate that PaMA outperforms prior methods with up to
12.58% H-score gains, while maintaining strong generalization on base GCD
datasets.

TL;DR: 论文研究了自动作文评分（AES）中的置信度建模，通过分类任务预测评分是否符合CEFR等级，使用得分分箱和新型损失函数提升性能，模型F1分数达0.97，显著提高了评分的可靠性。

Motivation: 解决AES评分可靠性问题，确保评分仅在达到高标准时发布，提升自动评分的可信度。

Method: 将置信度估计视为分类任务，采用得分分箱将其转化为多分类问题，并引入KWOCCE损失函数以利用CEFR标签的顺序结构。

Result: 最佳模型F1分数为0.97，47%的评分达到100% CEFR一致性，99%的评分达到至少95%一致性，显著优于仅使用AES模型时的92%一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的置信度建模方法有效提升了AES评分的可靠性和选择性发布能力。

Abstract: A key ethical challenge in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is ensuring that
scores are only released when they meet high reliability standards. Confidence
modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the
form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame
confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an
AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level.
While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the
scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary
classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel
Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that
incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model
achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores
with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to
approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where
we release all AM predicted scores.

TL;DR: 论文提出PRO方法，解决了直接偏好优化中的似然不确定性问题，并在多种反馈类型中表现优于现有方法。

Motivation: 传统直接对齐方法（如DPO）在优化LLMs时，虽然能匹配相对偏好，但会降低响应绝对似然，导致奖励破解等问题。本研究旨在解决这一根本限制。

Method: 通过分解DPO损失函数，提出PRO方法，恢复完整正则项以消除似然不确定性，并支持更广泛的反馈类型（如成对、二元和标量反馈）。

Result: 实验证明PRO在多种反馈场景下优于现有方法，有效解决了似然不确定性问题。

Conclusion: PRO作为一种统一的对齐方法，通过理论重构和正则项优化，显著提升了LLMs在不同反馈类型中的表现。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods typically optimize large language models (LLMs) by
contrasting the likelihoods of preferred versus dispreferred responses. While
effective in steering LLMs to match relative preference, these methods are
frequently noted for decreasing the absolute likelihoods of example responses.
As a result, aligned models tend to generate outputs that deviate from the
expected patterns, exhibiting reward-hacking effect even without a reward
model. This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in
contrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.
In this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal
direct alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a
decomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability
to a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the
underlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard
DPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated
loss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the
underdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized
PReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback
types, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient
approximation of the complete regularizer. Comprehensive experiments show the
superiority of PRO over existing methods in scenarios involving pairwise,
binary and scalar feedback.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种介于'随机鹦鹉'与'具备高级推理能力'之间的观点，认为LLMs通过'上下文引导外推'从训练数据中提取信息，其能力是可预测、可控的，且不依赖无限扩展的训练规模。

Motivation: 针对当前对LLM能力的极端观点（要么是'随机鹦鹉'，要么具备不可控的'涌现'高级推理能力），本文试图提供一个更现实的中间立场，以消除对LLM不可控能力的担忧，并重新聚焦研究方向。

Method: 通过文献综述提出'上下文引导外推'（context-directed extrapolation）机制，解释LLMs如何从训练数据中定向提取信息并外推，而非依赖不可预测的'涌现'能力。

Result: 论证LLMs的能力虽超越随机重复，但仍可预测、可控，且不与人类高级认知能力等同；同时指出其能力无法通过无限训练无限扩展。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究应关注上下文引导外推与训练数据的交互，以及不依赖LLMs固有推理能力的增强技术。

Abstract: In this position paper we raise critical awareness of a realistic view of LLM
capabilities that eschews extreme alternative views that LLMs are either
"stochastic parrots" or in possession of "emergent" advanced reasoning
capabilities, which, due to their unpredictable emergence, constitute an
existential threat. Our middle-ground view is that LLMs extrapolate from priors
from their training data, and that a mechanism akin to in-context learning
enables the targeting of the appropriate information from which to extrapolate.
We call this "context-directed extrapolation." Under this view, substantiated
though existing literature, while reasoning capabilities go well beyond
stochastic parroting, such capabilities are predictable, controllable, not
indicative of advanced reasoning akin to high-level cognitive capabilities in
humans, and not infinitely scalable with additional training. As a result,
fears of uncontrollable emergence of agency are allayed, while research
advances are appropriately refocused on the processes of context-directed
extrapolation and how this interacts with training data to produce valuable
capabilities in LLMs. Future work can therefore explore alternative augmenting
techniques that do not rely on inherent advanced reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为Q-RM的令牌级奖励模型，通过解耦奖励建模与语言生成，显著提升了复杂推理任务中策略模型的性能。

Motivation: 为了克服过程奖励模型(PRMs)中生成语言建模与奖励建模之间的冲突，避免不稳定的信用分配问题。

Method: 提出Q-RM模型，通过优化判别策略来学习令牌级Q函数，不依赖细粒度标注。

Result: 实验结果表明，Q-RM在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，尤其在强化学习中显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Conclusion: Q-RM有效解决了PRMs中的冲突问题，为复杂推理任务的模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) provide more nuanced supervision compared to
outcome reward models (ORMs) for optimizing policy models, positioning them as
a promising approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in complex reasoning
tasks. Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level
granularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative
models, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.
However, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling
may introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address
this challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward
modeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through
the optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model
(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level
Q-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.
In our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across
various benchmarks. For example, when integrated into PPO/REINFORCE algorithms,
Q-RM enhances the average Pass@1 score by 5.85/4.70 points on mathematical
reasoning tasks compared to the ORM baseline, and by 4.56/5.73 points compared
to the token-level PRM counterpart. Moreover, reinforcement learning with Q-RM
significantly enhances training efficiency, achieving convergence 12 times
faster than ORM on GSM8K and 11 times faster than step-level PRM on MATH. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于推理调优的大型语言模型（LLM）的流程，结合语言学驱动的文本分割技术，从思维链（CoTs）中提取支持或反对每个答案选项的陈述，提高了准确性。同时还提出了一种基于排名的HLV评估框架，优于现有方法和基准，并更符合人类评估。

Motivation: 人类标注者对于同一数据实例可能存在多种合理的标注差异（HLV）。虽然已有研究表明LLM生成的解释可以帮助模型预测与人类标注分布对齐，但通常采用反向范式（基于给定答案生成解释）。而思维链（CoTs）提供了前向推理路径，可能隐含每个答案选项的合理性，因此研究如何利用CoTs改进HLV评估具有重要意义。

Method: 提出一种LLM流程，结合语言学驱动的文本分割器，从CoTs中提取支持和反对每个答案选项的陈述。同时设计了基于排名的HLV评估框架，更注重答案的排序而非精确评分。

Result: 该方法在三个数据集上优于直接生成方法和基准模型，且其排名方法与人类评估的契合度更高。

Conclusion: 通过语言学驱动的文本分割和基于排名的评估框架，该方法有效提升了LLM在HLV任务中的表现，并更好地与人类评估对齐。

Abstract: The recent rise of reasoning-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs)--which
generate chains of thought (CoTs) before giving the final answer--has attracted
significant attention and offers new opportunities for gaining insights into
human label variation, which refers to plausible differences in how multiple
annotators label the same data instance. Prior work has shown that
LLM-generated explanations can help align model predictions with human label
distributions, but typically adopt a reverse paradigm: producing explanations
based on given answers. In contrast, CoTs provide a forward reasoning path that
may implicitly embed rationales for each answer option, before generating the
answers. We thus propose a novel LLM-based pipeline enriched with
linguistically-grounded discourse segmenters to extract supporting and opposing
statements for each answer option from CoTs with improved accuracy. We also
propose a rank-based HLV evaluation framework that prioritizes the ranking of
answers over exact scores, which instead favor direct comparison of label
distributions. Our method outperforms a direct generation method as well as
baselines on three datasets, and shows better alignment of ranking methods with
humans, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) via jailbreaking
techniques-methods that circumvent their built-in safety and ethical
constraints-have emerged as a critical challenge in AI security. These attacks
compromise the reliability of LLMs by exploiting inherent weaknesses in their
comprehension capabilities. This paper investigates the efficacy of
jailbreaking strategies that are specifically adapted to the diverse levels of
understanding exhibited by different LLMs. We propose the Adaptive Jailbreaking
Strategies Based on the Semantic Understanding Capabilities of Large Language
Models, a novel framework that classifies LLMs into Type I and Type II
categories according to their semantic comprehension abilities. For each
category, we design tailored jailbreaking strategies aimed at leveraging their
vulnerabilities to facilitate successful attacks. Extensive experiments
conducted on multiple LLMs demonstrate that our adaptive strategy markedly
improves the success rate of jailbreaking. Notably, our approach achieves an
exceptional 98.9% success rate in jailbreaking GPT-4o(29 May 2025 release)

Abstract: Factual knowledge extraction aims to explicitly extract knowledge
parameterized in pre-trained language models for application in downstream
tasks. While prior work has been investigating the impact of supervised
fine-tuning data on the factuality of large language models (LLMs), its
mechanism remains poorly understood. We revisit this impact through systematic
experiments, with a particular focus on the factuality gap that arises when
fine-tuning on known versus unknown knowledge. Our findings show that this gap
can be mitigated at the inference stage, either under out-of-distribution (OOD)
settings or by using appropriate in-context learning (ICL) prompts (i.e.,
few-shot learning and Chain of Thought (CoT)). We prove this phenomenon
theoretically from the perspective of knowledge graphs, showing that the
test-time prompt may diminish or even overshadow the impact of fine-tuning data
and play a dominant role in knowledge extraction. Ultimately, our results shed
light on the interaction between finetuning data and test-time prompt,
demonstrating that ICL can effectively compensate for shortcomings in
fine-tuning data, and highlighting the need to reconsider the use of ICL
prompting as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fine-tuning data
selection methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores learning rate (LR) warmup schedules for large-scale speech-to-text models, finding that a sub-exponential warmup is optimal and that higher initial LRs speed up early convergence but not final performance.

Motivation: To address the challenges of training large-scale speech-to-text models, especially the need for effective LR warmup schedules, as simple LR reduction is insufficient for complex architectures like Conformer or Branchformer.

Method: The study compares different LR warmup schedules, including a double linear warmup, and analyzes their impact on model convergence and final performance.

Result: It reveals that sub-exponential LR warmup is best for large-scale S2T training, and while higher initial LRs accelerate early convergence, they do not improve final model performance.

Conclusion: Optimal LR warmup strategies, specifically sub-exponential schedules, are crucial for efficient training of large-scale speech-to-text models without compromising final accuracy.

Abstract: Training large-scale models presents challenges not only in terms of resource
requirements but also in terms of their convergence. For this reason, the
learning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.
Such a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)
trainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer
architecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their
better performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of
the LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating
it to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in
practice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on
the final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper
fills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a
sub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates
initial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.

Method: 构建基于知识图谱的双语数据集UAQFact，并定义两项新任务分别评估模型利用内部和外部知识的能力。

Conclusion: UAQFact为评估大语言模型的知识利用能力提供了新基准，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Handling unanswerable questions (UAQ) is crucial for LLMs, as it helps
prevent misleading responses in complex situations. While previous studies have
built several datasets to assess LLMs' performance on UAQ, these datasets lack
factual knowledge support, which limits the evaluation of LLMs' ability to
utilize their factual knowledge when handling UAQ. To address the limitation,
we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset
with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on
UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize
internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results
across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges,
as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge
stored. Additionally, we find that incorporating external knowledge may enhance
performance, but LLMs still cannot make full use of the knowledge which may
result in incorrect responses.

Abstract: The Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment for Neurological
Surgeons (CNS-SANS) questions are widely used by neurosurgical residents to
prepare for written board examinations. Recently, these questions have also
served as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical
knowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs
on neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the
inclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted
using 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery
board examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study
introduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The
framework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing
polysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to
determine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on
standard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing
outcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing
threshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model
architectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model
failing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical
open-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to
proprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current
LLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam
questions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting
information. These findings underscore the critical need for developing novel
mitigation strategies aimed at bolstering LLM resilience against in-text
distractions, particularly for safe and effective clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的提示方法，通过减少大语言模型（RLLM）在长链思维推理中的过度思考现象（如自我怀疑导致的多余推理步骤），从而提升推理效率和准确性。

Motivation: RLLMs在复杂任务中表现出色，但常因‘过度思考’（如自我怀疑）而进行不必要的推理步骤。此前研究多为定性分析，本文则从自我怀疑的定量角度切入，旨在减少这种低效现象。

Method: 提出一种简单的提示方法：先让模型评估输入问题的有效性，再根据评估结果简洁回答。此方法旨在减少模型对问题的过度依赖，从而避免自我怀疑。

Result: 在3个数学推理任务和4个缺失前提的数据集上，该方法显著缩短了答案长度，并在4种RLLMs上几乎全部提升了性能，同时减少了推理步骤和自我怀疑。

Conclusion: 提出的提示方法通过抑制自我怀疑有效减少了过度思考，提升了RLLMs的推理效率和准确性。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
performance on complex tasks, largely due to the adoption of Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning. However, they often exhibit overthinking
-- performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after arriving at the correct
answer. Prior work has largely focused on qualitative analyses of overthinking
through sample-based observations of long CoTs. In contrast, we present a
quantitative analysis of overthinking from the perspective of self-doubt,
characterized by excessive token usage devoted to re-verifying already-correct
answer. We find that self-doubt significantly contributes to overthinking. In
response, we introduce a simple and effective prompting method to reduce the
model's over-reliance on input questions, thereby avoiding self-doubt.
Specifically, we first prompt the model to question the validity of the input
question, and then respond concisely based on the outcome of that evaluation.
Experiments on three mathematical reasoning tasks and four datasets with
missing premises demonstrate that our method substantially reduces answer
length and yields significant improvements across nearly all datasets upon 4
widely-used RLLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes the number of reasoning steps and reduces self-doubt.

Motivation: 探索码本大小和语音单元粗糙度如何影响SLM性能，以优化语音表示的选择。

Method: 使用持续时间惩罚的动态规划（DPDP）方法调整码本大小和单元粗糙度，并在不同语言层次进行分析。

using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New
analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and
word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size
is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a
resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and
syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at
lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but
that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks
where they are beneficial.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了KGQAGen，一个结合LLM和符号验证的框架，用于生成高质量的知识图谱问答基准，并构建了KGQAGen-10k数据集，展示了现有模型在新基准上的局限性。

Motivation: 现有的知识图谱问答基准（如WebQSP和CWQ）存在标注不准确、问题模糊或无法回答等问题，限制了KGQA系统的评估和发展。

Method: 提出KGQAGen框架，结合结构化知识、LLM生成和符号验证，生成高质量问答样本。

Result: 构建KGQAGen-10k数据集，实验表明即使最先进的KGQA模型在该基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: KGQAGen为KGQA评估提供了可扩展的高质量基准生成框架，呼吁更严格的基准构建标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Conclusion: 语言特征提取、注意力池化和多任务学习可有效提升承诺验证任务的表现，尽管面临类别不平衡和训练数据有限的挑战。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the SemEval-2025 Task~6 (PromiseEval),
which focuses on verifying promises in corporate ESG (Environmental, Social,
and Governance) reports. We explore three model architectures to address the
four subtasks of promise identification, supporting evidence assessment,
clarity evaluation, and verification timing. Our first model utilizes ESG-BERT
with task-specific classifier heads, while our second model enhances this
architecture with linguistic features tailored for each subtask. Our third
approach implements a combined subtask model with attention-based sequence
pooling, transformer representations augmented with document metadata, and
multi-objective learning. Experiments on the English portion of the ML-Promise
dataset demonstrate progressive improvement across our models, with our
combined subtask approach achieving a leaderboard score of 0.5268,
outperforming the provided baseline of 0.5227. Our work highlights the
effectiveness of linguistic feature extraction, attention pooling, and
multi-objective learning in promise verification tasks, despite challenges
posed by class imbalance and limited training data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的优化框架PCPO，通过结合表面答案正确性和内部概率一致性，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖于结果导向的偏好数据（如答案正确性或一致性），忽视了响应内部的逻辑一致性，作者提出PCPO以弥补这一不足。

Method: 提出PCPO框架，采用双重定量指标（表面答案正确性和内在token级概率一致性）进行偏好选择。

Result: 实验表明，PCPO在多种大语言模型和基准测试中均优于仅依赖结果指标的方法。

Conclusion: PCPO通过结合外部结果和内部逻辑一致性，显著提升了模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in preference optimization have demonstrated significant
potential for improving mathematical reasoning capabilities in large language
models (LLMs). While current approaches leverage high-quality pairwise
preference data through outcome-based criteria like answer correctness or
consistency, they fundamentally neglect the internal logical coherence of
responses. To overcome this, we propose Probability-Consistent Preference
Optimization (PCPO), a novel framework that establishes dual quantitative
metrics for preference selection: (1) surface-level answer correctness and (2)
intrinsic token-level probability consistency across responses. Extensive
experiments show that our PCPO consistently outperforms existing outcome-only
criterion approaches across a diverse range of LLMs and benchmarks. Our code is

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译任务中的能力来源，提出了两种预训练数据类型的假设，并讨论了测试该假设的方法及其对翻译概念的潜在影响。

Motivation: 研究旨在解释LLMs在没有专门翻译训练的情况下展现出色翻译能力的现象，探讨其背后的数据机制和能力来源。

Method: 通过回顾近期研究和用户经验，提出并讨论了“双重性”假设，即LLMs的翻译能力可能源自两种不同类型的预训练数据。

Result: 论文提出LLMs的翻译能力可能来源于预训练数据中的偶然双语现象和指令调优，并探讨了测试这一假设的实证方法。

Conclusion: LLMs的翻译能力研究有助于重新定义深度学习时代的翻译概念，为人类和机器翻译提供新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in translation among other things,
demonstrating competitive performance for many language pairs in zero- and
few-shot settings. But unlike dedicated neural machine translation models, LLMs
are not trained on any translation-related objective. What explains their
remarkable translation abilities? Are these abilities grounded in "incidental
bilingualism" (Briakou et al. 2023) in training data? Does instruction tuning
contribute to it? Are LLMs capable of aligning and leveraging semantically
identical or similar monolingual contents from different corners of the
internet that are unlikely to fit in a single context window? I offer some
reflections on this topic, informed by recent studies and growing user
experience. My working hypothesis is that LLMs' translation abilities originate
in two different types of pre-training data that may be internalized by the
models in different ways. I discuss the prospects for testing the "duality"
hypothesis empirically and its implications for reconceptualizing translation,
human and machine, in the age of deep learning.

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析指令调优语言模型的潜在特征，并通过干预实验验证这些特征对拒绝行为的影响。

Conclusion: 通过机制化研究揭示了语言模型中拒绝行为的工作原理，为改进模型安全性和对抗攻击防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Refusal is a key safety behavior in aligned language models, yet the internal
mechanisms driving refusals remain opaque. In this work, we conduct a
mechanistic study of refusal in instruction-tuned LLMs using sparse
autoencoders to identify latent features that causally mediate refusal
behaviors. We apply our method to two open-source chat models and intervene on
refusal-related features to assess their influence on generation, validating
their behavioral impact across multiple harmful datasets. This enables a
fine-grained inspection of how refusal manifests at the activation level and
addresses key research questions such as investigating upstream-downstream
latent relationship and understanding the mechanisms of adversarial
jailbreaking techniques. We also establish the usefulness of refusal features
in enhancing generalization for linear probes to out-of-distribution
adversarial samples in classification tasks. We open source our code in

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用开源大语言模型（LLMs）识别YouTube上的阴谋论视频，发现文本模型召回率高但精度低，多模态模型表现不如纯文本模型，RoBERTa的性能接近更大参数的LLMs。

Motivation: YouTube作为全球领先的在线平台，易传播有害内容（如阴谋论）。研究希望通过LLMs提升对这类内容的检测能力。

Method: 利用标注数据集进行零样本测试，对比多种LLMs与微调RoBERTa的表现，并在未标注数据集上验证实用性。

Result: 文本LLMs召回率高但精度低；多模态模型表现较差；RoBERTa性能接近更大参数的LLMs。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在有害内容检测中有潜力但局限性明显，需更精确和鲁棒的系统。

Abstract: As a leading online platform with a vast global audience, YouTube's extensive
reach also makes it susceptible to hosting harmful content, including
disinformation and conspiracy theories. This study explores the use of
open-weight Large Language Models (LLMs), both text-only and multimodal, for
identifying conspiracy theory videos shared on YouTube. Leveraging a labeled
dataset of thousands of videos, we evaluate a variety of LLMs in a zero-shot
setting and compare their performance to a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline. Results
show that text-based LLMs achieve high recall but lower precision, leading to
increased false positives. Multimodal models lag behind their text-only
counterparts, indicating limited benefits from visual data integration. To
assess real-world applicability, we evaluate the most accurate models on an
unlabeled dataset, finding that RoBERTa achieves performance close to LLMs with
a larger number of parameters. Our work highlights the strengths and
limitations of current LLM-based approaches for online harmful content
detection, emphasizing the need for more precise and robust systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EvoScale的进化式测试时扩展方法，通过迭代优化和自我进化，显著提升了小型语言模型在真实软件工程任务中的表现。

Motivation: 当前小型语言模型在真实软件工程任务中表现不佳，而现有方法（如监督微调或测试时扩展）成本高且效率低。

Method: 采用进化式测试时扩展（EvoScale），结合选择、突变和强化学习，让模型能够自我进化，减少生成样本数量。

Result: EvoScale使32B参数的Satori-SWE-32B模型在SWE-Bench-Verified上性能达到或超过100B以上参数模型，且样本使用量少。

Conclusion: EvoScale为小型语言模型提供了一种高效、低成本的优化路径，显著提升其在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but
struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub
issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While
smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational
cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches
primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is
expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating
multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.
Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly
scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time
Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an
evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and
mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring
regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To
reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model
to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on
external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the
scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on
SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or
exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few
samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.

TL;DR: 本文首次探索了表格推理任务的推断时扩展，提出了两种后训练策略：蒸馏前沿模型推理轨迹和使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）。通过这两种方法，训练出的Table-R1系列模型在多项任务中表现优异，甚至超越GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1。

Motivation: 研究旨在提升表格推理任务的性能和效率，探索通过后训练策略（如蒸馏和强化学习）在小规模模型上实现接近或超越前沿模型的效果。

Method: 采用两种方法：1) 基于DeepSeek-R1生成的推理轨迹进行蒸馏训练（Table-R1-SFT）；2) 提出可验证奖励函数并应用GRPO算法进行强化学习（Table-R1-Zero）。

Result: Table-R1-Zero模型在多个表格推理任务中表现优异，匹配或超越GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1，且使用了仅7B参数的轻量模型，并展现出较强的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，指令微调、模型架构选择和跨任务泛化对提升表格推理能力至关重要，强化学习训练中还涌现了关键推理技能。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first study to explore inference-time scaling on
table reasoning tasks. We develop and evaluate two post-training strategies to
enable inference-time scaling: distillation from frontier model reasoning
traces and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). For
distillation, we introduce a large-scale dataset of reasoning traces generated
by DeepSeek-R1, which we use to fine-tune LLMs into the Table-R1-SFT model. For
RLVR, we propose task-specific verifiable reward functions and apply the GRPO
algorithm to obtain the Table-R1-Zero model. We evaluate our Table-R1-series
models across diverse table reasoning tasks, including short-form QA, fact
verification, and free-form QA. Notably, the Table-R1-Zero model matches or
exceeds the performance of GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, while using only a
7B-parameter LLM. It also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain
datasets. Extensive ablation and qualitative analyses reveal the benefits of
instruction tuning, model architecture choices, and cross-task generalization,
as well as emergence of essential table reasoning skills during RL training.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer语言模型在实际中广泛成功，但其理论表达能力尚未完全理解。之前的研究往往依赖与现实Transformer实现差异较大的理想化假设。本研究旨在更接近实际实现条件下精确描述Transformer的表达能力。

Method: 研究分析了固定精度、严格未来遮蔽和软注意力机制的Transformer，将其表达能力精确对应于一种仅包含过去算子的线性时序逻辑片段，并与形式语言理论、自动机理论和代数中的已知类别关联。

Result: 建立了Transformer表达能力与特定线性时序逻辑的精确对应关系，并验证了理论框架的正确性。实证结果表明，Transformer在理论能力范围内的语言任务上表现完美，而超出能力范围的任务则失败。

Conclusion: 研究为理解Transformer的表达能力提供了统一的理论框架，并且理论与实证结果高度一致。这对于改进和优化基于Transformer的模型设计具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) have achieved widespread empirical
success, but their theoretical expressive power remains only partially
understood. Prior work often relies on idealized models with assumptions --
such as arbitrary numerical precision and hard attention -- that diverge from
real-world transformers. In this work, we provide an exact characterization of
fixed-precision transformers with strict future masking and soft attention, an
idealization that more closely mirrors practical implementations. We show that
these models are precisely as expressive as a specific fragment of linear
temporal logic that includes only a single temporal operator: the past
operator. We further relate this logic to established classes in formal
language theory, automata theory, and algebra, yielding a rich and unified
theoretical framework for understanding transformer expressivity. Finally, we
present empirical results that align closely with our theory: transformers
trained on languages within their theoretical capacity generalize perfectly
over lengths, while they consistently fail to generalize on languages beyond
it.

Conclusion: 动态模式归纳技术能有效构建大规模知识图谱，并增强大语言模型的事实性。

Abstract: We present AutoSchemaKG, a framework for fully autonomous knowledge graph
construction that eliminates the need for predefined schemas. Our system
leverages large language models to simultaneously extract knowledge triples and
induce comprehensive schemas directly from text, modeling both entities and
events while employing conceptualization to organize instances into semantic
categories. Processing over 50 million documents, we construct ATLAS (Automated
Triple Linking And Schema induction), a family of knowledge graphs with 900+
million nodes and 5.9 billion edges. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on multi-hop QA tasks and enhances LLM factuality. Notably, our
schema induction achieves 95\% semantic alignment with human-crafted schemas
with zero manual intervention, demonstrating that billion-scale knowledge
graphs with dynamically induced schemas can effectively complement parametric

Conclusion: GeNRe系统为法语性别中性重写提供了可行方案，推动了NLP中性别偏见缓解技术的进步。

Abstract: A significant portion of the textual data used in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) exhibits gender biases, particularly due to the use
of masculine generics (masculine words that are supposed to refer to mixed
groups of men and women), which can perpetuate and amplify stereotypes. Gender
rewriting, an NLP task that involves automatically detecting and replacing
gendered forms with neutral or opposite forms (e.g., from masculine to
feminine), can be employed to mitigate these biases. While such systems have
been developed in a number of languages (English, Arabic, Portuguese, German,
French), automatic use of gender neutralization techniques (as opposed to
inclusive or gender-switching techniques) has only been studied for English.
This paper presents GeNRe, the very first French gender-neutral rewriting
system using collective nouns, which are gender-fixed in French. We introduce a
rule-based system (RBS) tailored for the French language alongside two
fine-tuned language models trained on data generated by our RBS. We also
explore the use of instruct-based models to enhance the performance of our
other systems and find that Claude 3 Opus combined with our dictionary achieves
results close to our RBS. Through this contribution, we hope to promote the
advancement of gender bias mitigation techniques in NLP for French.

Result: 冷启动监督微调（SFT）与可验证奖励强化学习（RL）能减轻幻觉，而仅蒸馏或无冷启动的RL训练会加剧幻觉。模型不确定性与事实准确性之间的错配是幻觉增加的原因。

Conclusion: 本文初步揭示了LRMs幻觉的成因，并提出了缓解幻觉的优化方向，如改进训练流程和认知行为对齐。

Abstract: Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in
solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As
these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks,
whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination
in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1
reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while
OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally
raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to
hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)
We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our
analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold
start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate
their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training
without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To
explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on
hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two
critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw
Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the
same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer
fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate
the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model
uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated
with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work
provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.

Motivation: 论据角色在高风险领域（如法律）的摘要中至关重要，研究旨在评估指令调优的大型语言模型是否充分保留这些信息。

Method: 引入ARC框架，评估三个开源性LLM在法律意见书和科学论文两种领域生成的摘要对论据角色的覆盖情况。

Result: LLMs能部分覆盖重要论据角色，但当论据分散时易遗漏关键信息，且模型的位置偏见影响论据覆盖。

Conclusion: 需要开发更注重论据的摘要策略，以解决LLMs在生成摘要时的局限性。

Abstract: Integrating structured information has long improved the quality of
abstractive summarization, particularly in retaining salient content. In this
work, we focus on a specific form of structure: argument roles, which are
crucial for summarizing documents in high-stakes domains such as law. We
investigate whether instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) adequately
preserve this information. To this end, we introduce Argument Representation
Coverage (ARC), a framework for measuring how well LLM-generated summaries
capture salient arguments. Using ARC, we analyze summaries produced by three
open-weight LLMs in two domains where argument roles are central: long legal
opinions and scientific articles. Our results show that while LLMs cover
salient argument roles to some extent, critical information is often omitted in
generated summaries, particularly when arguments are sparsely distributed
throughout the input. Further, we use ARC to uncover behavioral patterns --
specifically, how the positional bias of LLM context windows and role-specific
preferences impact the coverage of key arguments in generated summaries,
emphasizing the need for more argument-aware summarization strategies.

models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation.
These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal
representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain
prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we
propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy
that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By
casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a
reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize
factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolHaystack 基准测试揭示了当前大语言模型在长期交互中工具使用的局限性，尽管它们在标准多轮设置中表现良好。

Motivation: 现有评估大多假设工具在短上下文中的使用，无法反映模型在长期互动中的行为，因此需要新的基准测试。

Method: 引入 ToolHaystack 基准测试，通过包含多任务执行上下文和真实噪声的连续对话，评估模型的情境保持和干扰处理能力。

Result: 测试 14 种前沿大语言模型显示，虽然它们在标准多轮设置中表现良好，但在 ToolHaystack 中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前模型在长期交互中的稳健性存在关键缺陷，传统工具基准未能揭示这一点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in using
external tools to address user inquiries. However, most existing evaluations
assume tool use in short contexts, offering limited insight into model behavior
during realistic long-term interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce
ToolHaystack, a benchmark for testing the tool use capabilities in long-term
interactions. Each test instance in ToolHaystack includes multiple tasks
execution contexts and realistic noise within a continuous conversation,
enabling assessment of how well models maintain context and handle various
disruptions. By applying this benchmark to 14 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that while current models perform well in standard multi-turn settings, they
often significantly struggle in ToolHaystack, highlighting critical gaps in
their long-term robustness not revealed by previous tool benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出LoLA，一种低秩线性注意力与稀疏缓存的结合方法，有效解决了长序列下线性注意力的记忆冲突问题，显著提升了推理性能。

Motivation: 传统Transformer在大语言模型中因二次复杂度在长序列推理上效率低下，线性注意力虽高效但近似softmax注意力不准确；滑动窗口注意力虽能弥补短上下文任务，但在长上下文中仍存在“记忆冲突”。本文旨在解决这些局限。

Method: 提出LoLA方法，将过去的键值对分散存储到三种形式的内存中：(i)局部滑动窗口中的近期键值对；(ii)稀疏全局缓存中的难记忆键值对；(iii)线性注意力循环隐藏状态中的通用键值对。

Result: LoLA在RULER的8K上下文长度的“大海捞针”任务中实现了97.4%的准确率（从0.6%提升），缓存比Llama-3.1 8B小4.6倍，并在1B和8B参数的次二次模型中展现出色的零样本常识推理性能。

Conclusion: LoLA是一种轻量级方法，能显著弥补线性注意力与Transformer之间的性能差距，且可在单张消费级GPU上复现结果。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to "memory collisions". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文展示了如何使用预训练的wav2vec2.0模型高准确度自动分类英语和日语中的爆破音存在，证明了其在语音数据标注中的潜力。

Motivation: 当前语音研究中缺乏对多变语音现象的自动标注工具，而预训练的自监督模型（如wav2vec2.0）在语音分类任务中表现出色，能够编码细粒度的语音信息。

Method: 使用wav2vec2.0模型训练自动分类爆破音存在，测试其在英语和日语中的表现，并对比手工标注结果。

Result: 模型在精心准备和未经准备的语音库中均表现优异，自动标注结果与人工标注结果高度一致，重复了爆破音实现的变异性模式。

Conclusion: 预训练语音模型具备自动标注语音数据的潜力，能够简化并扩大语音研究的范围。

Abstract: Modern phonetic research regularly makes use of automatic tools for the
annotation of speech data, however few tools exist for the annotation of many
variable phonetic phenomena. At the same time, pre-trained self-supervised
models, such as wav2vec2.0, have been shown to perform well at speech
classification tasks and latently encode fine-grained phonetic information. We
demonstrate that wav2vec2.0 models can be trained to automatically classify
stop burst presence with high accuracy in both English and Japanese, robust
across both finely-curated and unprepared speech corpora. Patterns of
variability in stop realisation are replicated with the automatic annotations,
and closely follow those of manual annotations. These results demonstrate the
potential of pre-trained speech models as tools for the automatic annotation
and processing of speech corpus data, enabling researchers to `scale-up' the
scope of phonetic research with relative ease.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了儿童导向语言（CDL）与维基百科数据在训练语言模型时的表现差异，发现大多数情况下维基百科模型优于CDL模型，并提出新的评估方法FIT-CLAMS以控制频率效应。

Motivation: 验证CDL在多语言、模型类型和评估设置中的泛化能力，以确定其是否比互联网抓取数据更有效。

Method: 比较CDL和维基百科训练的模型在两种LM目标（掩码和因果）、三种语言（英语、法语、德语）和三个句法最小对基准上的表现，并引入FIT-CLAMS方法。

Result: CDL在大多数情况下表现不如维基百科模型，且未显示出更强的句法泛化能力。

Conclusion: 训练于CDL的语言模型并未在句法学习上表现更优，频率效应的控制在句法能力评估中至关重要。

Abstract: Seminal work by Huebner et al. (2021) showed that language models (LMs)
trained on English Child-Directed Language (CDL) can reach similar syntactic
abilities as LMs trained on much larger amounts of adult-directed written text,
suggesting that CDL could provide more effective LM training material than the
commonly used internet-crawled data. However, the generalizability of these
results across languages, model types, and evaluation settings remains unclear.
We test this by comparing models trained on CDL vs. Wikipedia across two LM
objectives (masked and causal), three languages (English, French, German), and
three syntactic minimal-pair benchmarks. Our results on these benchmarks show
inconsistent benefits of CDL, which in most cases is outperformed by Wikipedia
models. We then identify various shortcomings in previous benchmarks, and
introduce a novel testing methodology, FIT-CLAMS, which uses a
frequency-controlled design to enable balanced comparisons across training
corpora. Through minimal pair evaluations and regression analysis we show that
training on CDL does not yield stronger generalizations for acquiring syntax
and highlight the importance of controlling for frequency effects when
evaluating syntactic ability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出，基于最终答案的指标在评估大语言模型（LLM）的数学解题能力时存在局限性，因其混淆了抽象表达和算术计算两个子技能。研究发现，LLM的瓶颈主要在算术计算而非抽象表达，且思维链（CoT）对计算的帮助大于抽象表达。

Motivation: 现有评估LLM数学解题能力的指标（如最终答案准确性）无法区分抽象表达与算术计算，可能导致对模型推理能力的误判。研究旨在分解这两项子技能，更精准地评估LLM性能。

Method: 在GSM8K和SVAMP数据集上对Llama-3和Qwen2.5（1B-32B）进行分离评估，对比有无思维链（CoT）的表现，并通过因果修补验证抽象表达的存在与作用机制。

Result: 发现LLM的最终答案准确性主要受算术计算限制，而非抽象表达；CoT对计算的提升显著，但对抽象表达影响有限。模型通过‘先抽象后计算’机制在单次前向传递中完成推理。

Conclusion: 需解耦评估指标以准确衡量LLM的推理能力，并指导未来改进。抽象表达与计算技能的可组合性与时序性为模型优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Final-answer-based metrics are commonly used for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) on math word problems, often taken as proxies for reasoning
ability. However, such metrics conflate two distinct sub-skills: abstract
formulation (capturing mathematical relationships using expressions) and
arithmetic computation (executing the calculations). Through a disentangled
evaluation on GSM8K and SVAMP, we find that the final-answer accuracy of
Llama-3 and Qwen2.5 (1B-32B) without CoT is overwhelmingly bottlenecked by the
arithmetic computation step and not by the abstract formulation step. Contrary
to the common belief, we show that CoT primarily aids in computation, with
limited impact on abstract formulation. Mechanistically, we show that these two
skills are composed conjunctively even in a single forward pass without any
reasoning steps via an abstract-then-compute mechanism: models first capture
problem abstractions, then handle computation. Causal patching confirms these
abstractions are present, transferable, composable, and precede computation.
These behavioural and mechanistic findings highlight the need for disentangled
evaluation to accurately assess LLM reasoning and to guide future improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocialMaze是一个新的基准测试，旨在全面评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的社会推理能力，弥补现有评估框架过于简化的问题。

Motivation: 现有评估框架无法全面测试LLMs在复杂社会场景中的推理能力，SocialMaze填补了这一空白。

Method: SocialMaze通过六项任务评估三个核心挑战：深度推理、动态互动和信息不确定性，并结合自动化和人工验证数据质量。

Result: 评估发现：模型在处理动态互动和整合时间演化信息时表现差异显著；具备链式推理能力的模型在深层推理任务中更优；不确定性下模型推理能力显著下降；针对性微调可提升表现。

Conclusion: SocialMaze为LLMs的社会推理能力提供了系统化评估工具，揭示了模型在复杂社会场景中的表现及改进潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to socially grounded
tasks, such as online community moderation, media content analysis, and social
reasoning games. Success in these contexts depends on a model's social
reasoning ability - the capacity to interpret social contexts, infer others'
mental states, and assess the truthfulness of presented information. However,
there is currently no systematic evaluation framework that comprehensively
assesses the social reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Existing efforts often
oversimplify real-world scenarios and consist of tasks that are too basic to
challenge advanced models. To address this gap, we introduce SocialMaze, a new
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate social reasoning. SocialMaze
systematically incorporates three core challenges: deep reasoning, dynamic
interaction, and information uncertainty. It provides six diverse tasks across
three key settings: social reasoning games, daily-life interactions, and
digital community platforms. Both automated and human validation are used to
ensure data quality. Our evaluation reveals several key insights: models vary
substantially in their ability to handle dynamic interactions and integrate
temporally evolving information; models with strong chain-of-thought reasoning
perform better on tasks requiring deeper inference beyond surface-level cues;
and model reasoning degrades significantly under uncertainty. Furthermore, we
show that targeted fine-tuning on curated reasoning examples can greatly
improve model performance in complex social scenarios. The dataset is publicly

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for high-quality evaluation datasets
in low-resource languages to advance cross-lingual transfer. While
cross-lingual transfer offers a key strategy for leveraging multilingual
pretraining to expand language technologies to understudied and typologically
diverse languages, its effectiveness is dependent on quality and suitable
benchmarks. We release new sense-annotated datasets of sentences containing
polysemous words, spanning nine low-resource languages across diverse language
families and scripts. To facilitate dataset creation, the paper presents a
demonstrably beneficial semi-automatic annotation method. The utility of the
datasets is demonstrated through Word-in-Context (WiC) formatted experiments
that evaluate transfer on these low-resource languages. Results highlight the
importance of targeted dataset creation and evaluation for effective polysemy
disambiguation in low-resource settings and transfer studies. The released
datasets and code aim to support further research into fair, robust, and truly
multilingual NLP.

TL;DR: 摘要总结了大型语言模型(LLMs)的现有问题——缺乏对错误前提的批判能力,提出了一个新的评估基准PCBench,并对15种代表性LLMs进行了系统评估,发现其批判能力与推理能力并不总相关,且错误前提会导致过度思考。强调了提升LLMs前提批判能力的必要性。代码已开源。

Motivation: 现有研究多关注LLMs在理想环境中的推理能力,而忽略了它们在面对错误前提时的脆弱性。因此,需要评估和提升LLMs的前提批判能力,以增强其可靠性和以人为本的特性。

Method: 引入PCBench基准,包含四种错误类型和三个难度级别,并采用多维度评估指标。对15种代表性LLMs进行了系统评估。

Result: (1)多数模型需依赖显式提示才能检测错误,自主批判能力有限;(2)前提批判能力受问题和错误类型影响;(3)推理能力与前提批判能力无稳定相关性;(4)错误前提会导致模型过度思考,显著延长响应时间。

Conclusion: 提升LLMs对输入有效性的主动评估能力至关重要,前提批判能力应作为开发可靠、以人为本系统的基础能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid advancements, demonstrating
remarkable capabilities. However, a notable vulnerability persists: LLMs often
uncritically accept flawed or contradictory premises, leading to inefficient
reasoning and unreliable outputs. This emphasizes the significance of
possessing the \textbf{Premise Critique Ability} for LLMs, defined as the
capacity to proactively identify and articulate errors in input premises. Most
existing studies assess LLMs' reasoning ability in ideal settings, largely
ignoring their vulnerabilities when faced with flawed premises. Thus, we
introduce the \textbf{Premise Critique Bench (PCBench)}, designed by
incorporating four error types across three difficulty levels, paired with
multi-faceted evaluation metrics. We conducted systematic evaluations of 15
representative LLMs. Our findings reveal: (1) Most models rely heavily on
explicit prompts to detect errors, with limited autonomous critique; (2)
Premise critique ability depends on question difficulty and error type, with
direct contradictions being easier to detect than complex or procedural errors;
(3) Reasoning ability does not consistently correlate with the premise critique
ability; (4) Flawed premises trigger overthinking in reasoning models, markedly
lengthening responses due to repeated attempts at resolving conflicts. These
insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LLMs' proactive evaluation of
input validity, positioning premise critique as a foundational capability for
developing reliable, human-centric systems. The code is available at

TL;DR: DEER方法通过利用训练标签的token级统计信息优化ICL示例选择和纠正错误token，显著提升了NER任务性能，接近监督微调水平。

Motivation: 传统ICL在NER任务中仅基于语义相似性选择示例，忽略训练标签，导致性能不佳。DEER方法旨在通过利用标签统计信息改进示例选择和错误纠正。

Method: 1. 使用标签引导的token检索器优化示例选择；2. 通过标签统计识别易错token并提示LLM针对性修正。

Result: 在5个NER数据集和4种LLM上，DEER均优于现有ICL方法，接近监督微调性能，且在低资源场景下表现稳健。

Conclusion: DEER验证了标签统计信息在ICL中的重要性，显著提升了NER任务性能，尤其在低资源场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform new
tasks using only a few demonstrations. In Named Entity Recognition (NER),
demonstrations are typically selected based on semantic similarity to the test
instance, ignoring training labels and resulting in suboptimal performance. We
introduce DEER, a new method that leverages training labels through token-level
statistics to improve ICL performance. DEER first enhances example selection
with a label-guided, token-based retriever that prioritizes tokens most
informative for entity recognition. It then prompts the LLM to revisit
error-prone tokens, which are also identified using label statistics, and make
targeted corrections. Evaluated on five NER datasets using four different LLMs,
DEER consistently outperforms existing ICL methods and approaches the
performance of supervised fine-tuning. Further analysis shows its effectiveness
on both seen and unseen entities and its robustness in low-resource settings.

Result: 尽管仅训练了9个ML任务，7B的ML-Agent性能超越671B的DeepSeek-R1代理，且能持续提升并展示出色的跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 学习型代理范式通过强化学习有效提升LLM代理的自主性和性能，小规模模型也能实现超越更大模型的成果。

Abstract: The emergence of large language model (LLM)-based agents has significantly
advanced the development of autonomous machine learning (ML) engineering.
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on manual prompt engineering,
failing to adapt and optimize based on diverse experimental experiences.
Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based
agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML
tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a
novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1)
exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse
actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training
on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving
training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies
varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization.
Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM
for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our
7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent. Furthermore, it
achieves continuous performance improvements and demonstrates exceptional
cross-task generalization capabilities.

Result: 在PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上，SITAlign在保持无害性阈值的同时，GPT-4胜率比现有方法高22.3%。

Conclusion: SITAlign通过满意策略有效解决了多面向对齐问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the
inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing
approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they
often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded
rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing
strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable
thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing
alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the
multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while
satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide
theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based
inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance
through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the
PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while
ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4
win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on
harmlessness.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ATLAS，一种高容量的长期记忆模块，通过基于当前和过去的令牌优化记忆，改进现代循环神经网络的三个设计缺陷，并在此基础上提出DeepTransformers架构，实验表明其在多项任务中优于Transformer和线性循环模型。

Motivation: Transformer的二次方复杂度限制了其在长序列中的应用，而现代循环神经网络在某些任务中表现不佳，特别是长上下文理解和外推任务。论文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了ATLAS模块，通过提高记忆容量、优化记忆更新机制和增强固定大小记忆的表达能力，克服循环神经网络的缺陷，并在此基础上提出DeepTransformers架构。

Result: ATLAS在多任务（如语言建模、常识推理、长上下文理解）中优于Transformer和线性循环模型，尤其在长上下文任务中性能提升显著（BABILong基准中准确率提升80%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS和DeepTransformers在长序列任务中展现了优越性能，为序列建模提供了新的高效架构。

Abstract: Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of

knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a
comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to
enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale
benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems
and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for
correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically
constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement
learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving,
leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical
inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process
evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning
steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly
improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and
supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and
reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to
fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical
exploration.

TL;DR: 论文研究当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）解决画谜（rebus puzzles）的能力，发现模型能处理简单的视觉线索，但在需要抽象推理和视觉隐喻的任务上表现不佳。

Motivation: 画谜作为一种多模态语言编码的视觉谜题，对现有VLM的抽象推理和文化、语言理解能力提出了独特挑战。研究旨在评估VLM在此类任务上的能力。

Method: 通过构建一个手工生成且多样化的画谜基准测试，包括从简单图像替换到空间依赖线索的谜题，分析不同VLM的表现。

Result: VLMs能解码简单的视觉线索，但在需要抽象推理、横向思维和视觉隐喻理解的任务上表现显著不足。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在处理复杂画谜时仍存在局限，需进一步提升多模态抽象与文化语言理解能力。

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial
arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current
vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question
answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic
reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this
paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve
rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of
diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic
substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how
different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some
surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle
significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and
understanding visual metaphors.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了聚合式问答（Aggregative Question Answering）这一新任务，旨在通过分析大规模用户与聊天机器人交互数据来回答聚合式查询，并提出了WildChat-AQA基准数据集。实验表明现有方法难以有效处理此类任务，突出了新方法的必要性。

Motivation: 现有的方法通常将用户与聊天机器人的交互视为独立的，缺乏对大规模对话数据的聚合分析，从而错失潜在的集体洞察力。

Method: 提出聚合式问答任务，并构建WildChat-AQA基准数据集，包含6,027个聚合问题，来源于182,330条真实聊天记录。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法要么推理能力不足，要么计算成本过高。

Abstract: Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.

Conclusion: 基于样条的神经架构（如KAN/TKAN）在高效和数据高效的天气预报中具有潜力，但不同模型在不同任务中表现各异。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is crucial for managing risks and economic planning,
particularly in tropical Africa, where extreme events severely impact
livelihoods. Yet, existing forecasting methods often struggle with the region's
complex, non-linear weather patterns. This study benchmarks deep recurrent
neural networks such as $\texttt{LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU}$, and
Kolmogorov-Arnold-based models $(\texttt{KAN} and \texttt{TKAN})$ for daily
forecasting of temperature, precipitation, and pressure in two tropical cities:
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Kigali (Rwanda). We further introduce
two customized variants of $ \texttt{TKAN}$ that replace its original
$\texttt{SiLU}$ activation function with $ \texttt{GeLU}$ and \texttt{MiSH},
respectively. Using station-level meteorological data spanning from 2010 to
2024, we evaluate all the models on standard regression metrics. $\texttt{KAN}$
achieves temperature prediction ($R^2=0.9986$ in Abidjan, $0.9998$ in Kigali,
$\texttt{MSE} < 0.0014~^\circ C ^2$), while $\texttt{TKAN}$ variants minimize
absolute errors for precipitation forecasting in low-rainfall regimes. The
customized $\texttt{TKAN}$ models demonstrate improvements over the standard
$\texttt{TKAN}$ across both datasets. Classical \texttt{RNNs} remain highly
competitive for atmospheric pressure ($R^2 \approx 0.83{-}0.86$), outperforming
$\texttt{KAN}$-based models in this task. These results highlight the potential
of spline-based neural architectures for efficient and data-efficient
forecasting.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SlimLLM is a novel structured pruning method for large language models (LLMs) that evaluates importance holistically at the channel or head level and uses a linear regression strategy to recover performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on the LLaMA benchmark.

Motivation: To address the high computational costs and deployment limitations of LLMs by developing an efficient structured pruning method that minimizes performance loss.

Method: Proposes SlimLLM, which evaluates sub-module importance holistically (channel/head level) and uses linear regression for performance recovery, with layer-based importance ratios for pruning.

Result: SlimLLM outperforms other methods on the LLaMA benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: SlimLLM effectively compresses LLMs with minimal performance loss, offering a practical solution for deployment challenges.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have garnered significant attention and
demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications. However,
due to their enormous computational costs, the deployment and application of
LLMs are often severely limited. To address this issue, structured pruning is
an effective solution to compress the parameters of LLMs. Determining the
importance of each sub-module in LLMs and minimizing performance loss are
critical issues that need to be carefully addressed in structured pruning. In
this paper, we propose an effective and fast structured pruning method named
SlimLLM for large language models. For channel and attention head pruning, we
evaluate the importance based on the entire channel or head, rather than merely
aggregating the importance of individual elements within a sub-module. This
approach enables a more holistic consideration of the interdependence among
elements within the sub-module. In addition, we design a simple linear
regression strategy for the output matrix to quickly recover performance. We
also propose layer-based importance ratio to determine the pruning ratio for
each layer. Based on the LLaMA benchmark results, our SlimLLM outperforms other
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MoRE的多任务参数高效微调方法，通过联合训练低秩专家和自适应秩选择器，显著提升了LoRA在多任务场景下的性能和效率。

Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法（如LoRA）在多任务场景中效率低下，要么仅适用于单任务，要么需单独训练多个模块，限制了LoRA的效能。本文旨在改善这一问题。

Method: 采用Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE)方法，将不同秩的LoRA模块（低秩专家）与任务对齐，并设计自适应秩选择器，联合训练低秩专家以实现多任务适配。

Result: 实验表明，MoRE在多任务基准测试中显著优于传统LoRA及其变体，且不增加额外推理成本。

Conclusion: MoRE通过创新设计有效提升了LoRA在多任务场景下的适应性和效率，为LLM的多任务微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs),
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant
attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer
parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters
and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty
of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these
methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA
modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of
LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in
this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for
multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each
task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we
named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to
select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank
experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task
scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task
benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE
significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and
incurs no additional inference cost. We also release the model and code to
facilitate the community.

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face significant challenges in optimizing order
dispatching and driver repositioning operations in dynamic urban environments.
Traditional approaches based on combinatorial optimization, rule-based
heuristics, and reinforcement learning often overlook driver income fairness,
interpretability, and adaptability to real-world dynamics. To address these
gaps, we propose LLM-ODDR, a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) for joint Order Dispatching and Driver Repositioning (ODDR) in
ride-hailing services. LLM-ODDR framework comprises three key components: (1)
Multi-objective-guided Order Value Refinement, which evaluates orders by
considering multiple objectives to determine their overall value; (2)
Fairness-aware Order Dispatching, which balances platform revenue with driver
income fairness; and (3) Spatiotemporal Demand-Aware Driver Repositioning,
which optimizes idle vehicle placement based on historical patterns and
projected supply. We also develop JointDR-GPT, a fine-tuned model optimized for
ODDR tasks with domain knowledge. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
from Manhattan taxi operations demonstrate that our framework significantly
outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness, adaptability to
anomalous conditions, and decision interpretability. To our knowledge, this is
the first exploration of LLMs as decision-making agents in ride-hailing ODDR
tasks, establishing foundational insights for integrating advanced language
models within intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: 目标是探索神经进化（NE）在任务间技能迁移中的能力，以解决强化学习（RL）在任务变化和灾难性遗忘方面的局限性。

Method: 引入了两个基准测试：a) stepping gates用于模拟逻辑电路，强调模块化重复和变化；b) ecorobot扩展了Brax物理引擎，包含墙壁和障碍物，并支持不同机器人形态的切换。均采用了逐步复杂的任务课程来评估技能迁移。

Result: 实验分析表明，NE方法在迁移能力上表现优异，经常优于RL基线方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持NE作为构建更适应性代理的潜力，并指出了未来在复杂现实问题中扩展NE的挑战。

Abstract: The ability to continuously and efficiently transfer skills across tasks is a
hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal in artificial
systems. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for learning in
high-dimensional control tasks, is known to suffer from brittleness to task
variations and catastrophic forgetting. Neuroevolution (NE) has recently gained
attention for its robustness, scalability, and capacity to escape local optima.
In this paper, we investigate an understudied dimension of NE: its transfer
learning capabilities. To this end, we introduce two benchmarks: a) in stepping
gates, neural networks are tasked with emulating logic circuits, with designs
that emphasize modular repetition and variation b) ecorobot extends the Brax
physics engine with objects such as walls and obstacles and the ability to
easily switch between different robotic morphologies. Crucial in both
benchmarks is the presence of a curriculum that enables evaluating skill
transfer across tasks of increasing complexity. Our empirical analysis shows
that NE methods vary in their transfer abilities and frequently outperform RL
baselines. Our findings support the potential of NE as a foundation for
building more adaptable agents and highlight future challenges for scaling NE
to complex, real-world problems.

Motivation: 当预训练模型更新时，微调模型会失效，需要重新训练。研究者希望找到一种无需数据的方法，将微调知识迁移到新模型上。

Result: 在视觉和文本任务上的实验表明，该方法能无缝迁移微调知识，无需重新训练或数据。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了微调知识的零数据迁移，解决了预训练模型更新时的微调模型失效问题。

Abstract: Foundation models serve as the backbone for numerous specialized models
developed through fine-tuning. However, when the underlying pretrained model is
updated or retrained (e.g., on larger and more curated datasets), the
fine-tuned model becomes obsolete, losing its utility and requiring retraining.
This raises the question: is it possible to transfer fine-tuning to a new
release of the model? In this work, we investigate how to transfer fine-tuning
to a new checkpoint without having to re-train, in a data-free manner. To do
so, we draw principles from model re-basin and provide a recipe based on weight
permutations to re-base the modifications made to the original base model,
often called task vector. In particular, our approach tailors model re-basin
for Transformer models, taking into account the challenges of residual
connections and multi-head attention layers. Specifically, we propose a
two-level method rooted in spectral theory, initially permuting the attention
heads and subsequently adjusting parameters within select pairs of heads.
Through extensive experiments on visual and textual tasks, we achieve the
seamless transfer of fine-tuned knowledge to new pre-trained backbones without
relying on a single training step or datapoint. Code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了RaCO-DP，一种解决在差分隐私（DP）下带速率约束的优化问题的算法，通过改进SGDA方法并在隐私成本分析中引入直方图估计，显著提升了公平性与效用的权衡。

Motivation: 在可信机器学习中，许多问题可以转化为在模型预测速率的约束下最小化模型误差。然而，差分隐私优化技术（如DP-SGD）依赖于损失函数的可分性，而速率约束引入了样本间的依赖性，破坏了可分性要求。因此，需要一种新的方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 论文提出了RaCO-DP算法，这是SGDA算法的DP变体。它通过拉格朗日乘子法解决了带速率约束的问题，并在隐私成本分析中引入了对每个优化步骤的小批量直方图估计。

Result: 理论分析证明了算法的收敛性，实验结果表明在满足组公平约束的学习任务中，RaCO-DP在公平性和效用的权衡上优于现有的私有学习方法。

Conclusion: RaCO-DP通过结合SGDA和隐私直方图估计，成功解决了在差分隐私下带速率约束的优化问题，为公平性与效用的权衡提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Many problems in trustworthy ML can be formulated as minimization of the
model error under constraints on the prediction rates of the model for
suitably-chosen marginals, including most group fairness constraints
(demographic parity, equality of odds, etc.). In this work, we study such
constrained minimization problems under differential privacy (DP). Standard DP
optimization techniques like DP-SGD rely on the loss function's decomposability
into per-sample contributions. However, rate constraints introduce inter-sample
dependencies, violating the decomposability requirement. To address this, we
develop RaCO-DP, a DP variant of the Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent (SGDA)
algorithm which solves the Lagrangian formulation of rate constraint problems.
We demonstrate that the additional privacy cost of incorporating these
constraints reduces to privately estimating a histogram over the mini-batch at
each optimization step. We prove the convergence of our algorithm through a
novel analysis of SGDA that leverages the linear structure of the dual
parameter. Finally, empirical results on learning under group fairness
constraints demonstrate that our method Pareto-dominates existing private
learning approaches in fairness-utility trade-offs.

Abstract: The size and compute characteristics of modern large language models have led
to an increased interest in developing specialized kernels tailored for

utilization, targeting the large-batch training and inference settings.
However, low-batch inference, where memory bandwidth and kernel launch
overheads contribute are significant factors, remains important for many
applications of interest such as in edge deployment and latency-sensitive
applications. This paper describes FlashFormer, a proof-of-concept kernel for
accelerating single-batch inference for transformer-based large language
models. Across various model sizes and quantizations settings, we observe
nontrivial speedups compared to existing state-of-the-art inference kernels.

Result: 实验表明，预测集大小平均减少10%-14%，且在多种数据集、模型和分布偏移下均有效。

Conclusion: 测试时增强是共形分类流程中一种灵活、高效且有价值的补充技术。

Abstract: A conformal classifier produces a set of predicted classes and provides a
probabilistic guarantee that the set includes the true class. Unfortunately, it
is often the case that conformal classifiers produce uninformatively large
sets. In this work, we show that test-time augmentation (TTA)--a technique that
introduces inductive biases during inference--reduces the size of the sets
produced by conformal classifiers. Our approach is flexible, computationally
efficient, and effective. It can be combined with any conformal score, requires
no model retraining, and reduces prediction set sizes by 10%-14% on average. We
conduct an evaluation of the approach spanning three datasets, three models,
two established conformal scoring methods, different guarantee strengths, and
several distribution shifts to show when and why test-time augmentation is a
useful addition to the conformal pipeline.

Abstract: The idea of value-aware model learning, that models should produce accurate
value estimates, has gained prominence in model-based reinforcement learning.
The MuZero loss, which penalizes a model's value function prediction compared
to the ground-truth value function, has been utilized in several prominent
empirical works in the literature. However, theoretical investigation into its
strengths and weaknesses is limited. In this paper, we analyze the family of
value-aware model learning losses, which includes the popular MuZero loss. We
show that these losses, as normally used, are uncalibrated surrogate losses,
which means that they do not always recover the correct model and value
function. Building on this insight, we propose corrections to solve this issue.
Furthermore, we investigate the interplay between the loss calibration, latent
model architectures, and auxiliary losses that are commonly employed when
training MuZero-style agents. We show that while deterministic models can be
sufficient to predict accurate values, learning calibrated stochastic models is
still advantageous.

or substantial computing resources needed to develop them. On the other hand,
this type of open ecosystem comes with many risks. In this paper, we argue that
the current ecosystem for open ML models contains significant supply-chain
risks, some of which have been exploited already in real attacks. These include
an attacker replacing a model with something malicious (e.g., malware), or a
model being trained using a vulnerable version of a framework or on restricted
or poisoned data. We then explore how Sigstore, a solution designed to bring
transparency to open-source software supply chains, can be used to bring
transparency to open ML models, in terms of enabling model publishers to sign
their models and prove properties about the datasets they use.

Abstract: Neural networks transform high-dimensional data into compact, structured
representations, often modeled as elements of a lower dimensional latent space.
In this paper, we present an alternative interpretation of neural models as
dynamical systems acting on the latent manifold. Specifically, we show that
autoencoder models implicitly define a latent vector field on the manifold,
derived by iteratively applying the encoding-decoding map, without any
additional training. We observe that standard training procedures introduce
inductive biases that lead to the emergence of attractor points within this
vector field. Drawing on this insight, we propose to leverage the vector field
as a representation for the network, providing a novel tool to analyze the
properties of the model and the data. This representation enables to: (i)
analyze the generalization and memorization regimes of neural models, even
throughout training; (ii) extract prior knowledge encoded in the network's
parameters from the attractors, without requiring any input data; (iii)
identify out-of-distribution samples from their trajectories in the vector
field. We further validate our approach on vision foundation models, showcasing
the applicability and effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The growing reliance on artificial intelligence in safety- and
security-critical applications demands effective neural network certification.
A challenging real-world use case is certification against ``patch attacks'',
where adversarial patches or lighting conditions obscure parts of images, for
example traffic signs. One approach to certification, which also gives
quantitative coverage estimates, utilizes preimages of neural networks, i.e.,
the set of inputs that lead to a specified output. However, these preimage
approximation methods, including the state-of-the-art PREMAP algorithm,
struggle with scalability. This paper presents novel algorithmic improvements
to PREMAP involving tighter bounds, adaptive Monte Carlo sampling, and improved
branching heuristics. We demonstrate efficiency improvements of at least an
order of magnitude on reinforcement learning control benchmarks, and show that
our method scales to convolutional neural networks that were previously
infeasible. Our results demonstrate the potential of preimage approximation
methodology for reliability and robustness certification.

Conclusion: CLUE是一种高效、领域无关的校准方法，适用于多种任务和场景。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is critical for deploying neural networks
(NNs) in real-world applications. While existing calibration techniques often
rely on post-hoc adjustments or coarse-grained binning methods, they remain
limited in scalability, differentiability, and generalization across domains.
In this work, we introduce CLUE (Calibration via Learning Uncertainty-Error
Alignment), a novel approach that explicitly aligns predicted uncertainty with
observed error during training, grounded in the principle that well-calibrated
models should produce uncertainty estimates that match their empirical loss.
CLUE adopts a novel loss function that jointly optimizes predictive performance
and calibration, using summary statistics of uncertainty and loss as proxies.
The proposed method is fully differentiable, domain-agnostic, and compatible
with standard training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on vision,
regression, and language modeling tasks, including out-of-distribution and
domain-shift scenarios, we demonstrate that CLUE achieves superior calibration
quality and competitive predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art
approaches without imposing significant computational overhead.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现数据集质量是独立于模型架构、数据集大小和类别平衡的内在属性，且数据集质量与其构成类别的质量相关，成为优化机器学习分类器的另一目标。

Motivation: 尽管模型架构、数据集大小和类别平衡已被证实影响分类器性能，但它们无法完全解释性能差异。本文旨在验证数据集质量是否为独立于这些因素的固有属性。

Method: 生成了数千个控制大小和类别平衡的数据集，并使用多种模型架构（如随机森林、支持向量机和深度网络）训练分类器，分析性能相关性。

Result: 不同架构的分类器在相同子集上表现高度相关（R²=0.79），表明数据集质量是独立于其他因素的固有属性，且与数据集中类别的质量相关。

Conclusion: 数据集质量是优化机器学习分类性能的独立因素，未来可针对其进行针对性优化。

Abstract: In the universal quest to optimize machine-learning classifiers, three
factors -- model architecture, dataset size, and class balance -- have been
shown to influence test-time performance but do not fully account for it.
Previously, evidence was presented for an additional factor that can be
referred to as dataset quality, but it was unclear whether this was actually a
joint property of the dataset and the model architecture, or an intrinsic
property of the dataset itself. If quality is truly dataset-intrinsic and
independent of model architecture, dataset size, and class balance, then the
same datasets should perform better (or worse) regardless of these other
factors. To test this hypothesis, here we create thousands of datasets, each
controlled for size and class balance, and use them to train classifiers with a
wide range of architectures, from random forests and support-vector machines to
deep networks. We find that classifier performance correlates strongly by
subset across architectures ($R^2=0.79$), supporting quality as an intrinsic
property of datasets independent of dataset size and class balance and of model
architecture. Digging deeper, we find that dataset quality appears to be an
emergent property of something more fundamental: the quality of datasets'
constituent classes. Thus, quality joins size, class balance, and model
architecture as an independent correlate of performance and a separate target
for optimizing machine-learning-based classification.

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了如何将响应时间数据整合到人类偏好学习框架中，以提高奖励模型的有效性。传统方法主要依赖二元偏好数据，而忽略了用户决策过程中的时间信息。通过结合响应时间和二元选择数据，并利用证据累积漂移扩散（EZ）模型，本文提出了一种新方法，显著提升了样本效率和模型收敛速度。

Motivation: 当前在微调基础模型和生成式AI系统中，主要依赖二元偏好数据，但用户决策过程中的时间信息未被充分利用。这些时间数据可能包含偏好强度的宝贵信息，因此探索如何利用这些信息以提高奖励模型的有效性是本文的核心动机。

Method: 本文提出了一种将响应时间信息与二元选择数据相结合的新方法，基于证据累积漂移扩散（EZ）模型，并开发了Neyman正交损失函数，实现了奖励模型学习的理论最优收敛速度。

Result: 理论分析表明，对于线性奖励函数，传统偏好学习方法的误差率随奖励幅度呈指数增长，而本文提出的响应时间增强方法将误差率降至多项式增长，显著提升了样本效率。实验在图像偏好学习中验证了这些理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过整合响应时间数据，可以显著提高奖励模型的学习效率和性能，特别是在复杂或非参数奖励函数空间中。这一方法为偏好学习提供了新的方向和改进空间。

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

Conclusion: PGLearn标准化了机器学习和最优电力潮流问题的数据集和评估方法，有助于加速该领域的研究和民主化访问。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques for Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have
recently garnered significant attention, reflecting a broader trend of
leveraging ML to approximate and/or accelerate the resolution of complex
optimization problems. These developments are necessitated by the increased
volatility and scale in energy production for modern and future grids. However,
progress in ML for OPF is hindered by the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation metrics, from generating and solving OPF instances, to training and
benchmarking machine learning models. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces PGLearn, a comprehensive suite of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools for ML and OPF. PGLearn provides datasets that are
representative of real-life operating conditions, by explicitly capturing both
global and local variability in the data generation, and by, for the first
time, including time series data for several large-scale systems. In addition,
it supports multiple OPF formulations, including AC, DC, and second-order cone
formulations. Standardized datasets are made publicly available to democratize
access to this field, reduce the burden of data generation, and enable the fair
comparison of various methodologies. PGLearn also includes a robust toolkit for
training, evaluating, and benchmarking machine learning models for OPF, with
the goal of standardizing performance evaluation across the field. By promoting
open, standardized datasets and evaluation metrics, PGLearn aims at
democratizing and accelerating research and innovation in machine learning
applications for optimal power flow problems. Datasets are available for

Abstract: This paper bridges distribution shift and AI safety through a comprehensive

issues can be formally reduced to each other, enabling mutual adaptation of
their methods. Our findings provide a unified perspective that encourages

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了扩散模型如何提高对抗鲁棒性，发现其并非通过减少与原始样本的距离，而是依赖内部随机性和压缩效应。在固定随机性下，鲁棒性提升大幅下降至24%，且剩余增益与输入的压缩率相关。

Motivation: 探究扩散模型提升对抗鲁棒性的具体机制，挑战已有的直观解释（如净化使输入更接近原始数据）。

Method: 通过观察扩散模型对干净样本的$ℓ_p$距离变化、分析内部随机性的影响，并在固定随机性下评估鲁棒性提升。

Result: 扩散模型的鲁棒性提升依赖于随机性配置的压缩效应；固定随机性后，CIFAR-10上的提升降至24%，剩余增益与压缩率强相关。

Conclusion: 揭示了扩散净化的机制（压缩效应），提出压缩率可作为鲁棒性指标，为设计更有效的对抗净化系统提供指导。

Abstract: Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical
adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed,
the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve
adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly
increase, rather than decrease, the $\ell_p$ distance to clean
samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to
the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily
influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression
effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this
observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the
improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than
prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining
robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the
input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator
without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights
into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance
for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition affecting over 48.9 million people
globally and causing 11 million deaths annually. Despite medical advancements,
predicting sepsis remains a challenge due to non-specific symptoms and complex
pathophysiology. The SXI++ LNM is a machine learning scoring system that
refines sepsis prediction by leveraging multiple algorithms and deep neural

evaluates the predictive performance of the SXI++ LNM for sepsis prediction.
The model, utilizing a deep neural network, was trained and tested using
multiple scenarios with different dataset distributions. The model's
performance was assessed against unseen test data, and accuracy, precision, and
area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. THE SXI++ LNM outperformed the
state of the art in three use cases, achieving an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI:
0.98-1.00). The model demonstrated a precision of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.8-100.0)

Conclusion: 简单的分数正则化无需额外学习即可缓解记忆问题，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models now set the benchmark in high-fidelity generative sampling,
yet they can, in principle, be prone to memorization. In this case, their
learned score overfits the finite dataset so that the reverse-time SDE samples
are mostly training points. In this paper, we interpret the empirical score as
a noisy version of the true score and show that its covariance matrix is
asymptotically a re-weighted data PCA. In large dimension, the small time limit
makes the noise variance blow up while simultaneously reducing spatial
correlation. To reduce this variance, we introduce a kernel-smoothed empirical
score and analyze its bias-variance trade-off. We derive asymptotic bounds on
the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution and the one
generated by the modified reverse SDE. Regularization on the score has the same
effect as increasing the size of the training dataset, and thus helps prevent
memorization. A spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion suggests better
variance control under some regularity conditions of the true data
distribution. Reverse diffusion with kernel-smoothed empirical score can be
reformulated as a gradient descent drifted toward a Log-Exponential
Double-Kernel Density Estimator (LED-KDE). This perspective highlights two
regularization mechanisms taking place in denoising diffusions: an initial
Gaussian kernel first diffuses mass isotropically in the ambient space, while a
second kernel applied in score space concentrates and spreads that mass along
the data manifold. Hence, even a straightforward regularization-without any
learning-already mitigates memorization and enhances generalization.
Numerically, we illustrate our results with several experiments on synthetic
and MNIST datasets.

Abstract: Tasks that involve complex interactions between objects with unknown dynamics
make planning before execution difficult. These tasks require agents to
iteratively improve their actions after actively exploring causes and effects
in the environment. For these type of tasks, we propose Causal-PIK, a method
that leverages Bayesian optimization to reason about causal interactions via a
Physics-Informed Kernel to help guide efficient search for the best next
action. Experimental results on Virtual Tools and PHYRE physical reasoning
benchmarks show that Causal-PIK outperforms state-of-the-art results, requiring
fewer actions to reach the goal. We also compare Causal-PIK to human studies,
including results from a new user study we conducted on the PHYRE benchmark. We
find that Causal-PIK remains competitive on tasks that are very challenging,
even for human problem-solvers.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models have emerged as powerful generative approaches
capable of modeling diverse and multimodal behavior. However, applying these
models to offline reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to the
iterative nature of their noise sampling processes, making policy optimization
difficult. In this paper, we introduce Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning
(SORL), a new offline RL algorithm that leverages shortcut models - a novel
class of generative models - to scale both training and inference. SORL's
policy can capture complex data distributions and can be trained simply and
efficiently in a one-stage training procedure. At test time, SORL introduces
both sequential and parallel inference scaling by using the learned Q-function
as a verifier. We demonstrate that SORL achieves strong performance across a
range of offline RL tasks and exhibits positive scaling behavior with increased
test-time compute. We release the code at

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在约束不确定性情境下表现优异，尤其在结合截断与重加权时效果更佳。

Abstract: We study an extension of contextual stochastic linear optimization (CSLO)
that, in contrast to most of the existing literature, involves inequality
constraints that depend on uncertain parameters predicted by a machine learning
model. To handle the constraint uncertainty, we use contextual uncertainty sets
constructed via methods like conformal prediction. Given a contextual
uncertainty set method, we introduce the "Smart Predict-then-Optimize with
Robust Constraints" (SPO-RC) loss, a feasibility-sensitive adaptation of the
SPO loss that measures decision error of predicted objective parameters. We
also introduce a convex surrogate, SPO-RC+, and prove Fisher consistency with
SPO-RC. To enhance performance, we train on truncated datasets where true
constraint parameters lie within the uncertainty sets, and we correct the
induced sample selection bias using importance reweighting techniques. Through
experiments on fractional knapsack and alloy production problem instances, we
demonstrate that SPO-RC+ effectively handles uncertainty in constraints and
that combining truncation with importance reweighting can further improve
performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了FTRL框架在动态环境中的表现，提出了一种通过优化未来成本和线性化过去成本的方法，使其能够实现动态遗憾保证。

Motivation: 针对FTRL框架在动态环境中因产生“惰性”迭代而受限的问题，研究如何通过优化和修剪方法提升其动态性能。

Method: 通过乐观组合未来成本和精细线性化过去成本，并对部分成本进行修剪，实现FTRL的动态遗憾保证。

Result: 新方法能够恢复已知的动态遗憾界，提供贪婪与敏捷更新之间的插值，优化控制遗憾项，并无需循环依赖地实现乐观。

Conclusion: 研究表明，FTRL的局限性在于算法状态与迭代的解耦，而非其投影方式，修剪方法能有效同步二者。

Abstract: We revisit the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework for Online
Convex Optimization (OCO) over compact sets, focusing on achieving dynamic
regret guarantees. Prior work has highlighted the framework's limitations in
dynamic environments due to its tendency to produce "lazy" iterates. However,
building on insights showing FTRL's ability to produce "agile" iterates, we
show that it can indeed recover known dynamic regret bounds through optimistic
composition of future costs and careful linearization of past costs, which can
lead to pruning some of them. This new analysis of FTRL against dynamic
comparators yields a principled way to interpolate between greedy and agile
updates and offers several benefits, including refined control over regret
terms, optimism without cyclic dependence, and the application of minimal
recursive regularization akin to AdaFTRL. More broadly, we show that it is not
the lazy projection style of FTRL that hinders (optimistic) dynamic regret, but
the decoupling of the algorithm's state (linearized history) from its iterates,
allowing the state to grow arbitrarily. Instead, pruning synchronizes these two
when necessary.

Abstract: The widespread success of foundation models in natural language processing
and computer vision has inspired researchers to extend the concept to
scientific machine learning and computational science. However, this position
paper argues that as the term "foundation model" is an evolving concept, its
application in computational science is increasingly used without a universally
accepted definition, potentially creating confusion and diluting its precise
scientific meaning. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a formal
definition of foundation models in computational science, grounded in the core
values of generality, reusability, and scalability. We articulate a set of
essential and desirable characteristics that such models must exhibit, drawing
parallels with traditional foundational methods, like the finite element and
finite volume methods. Furthermore, we introduce the Data-Driven Finite Element
Method (DD-FEM), a framework that fuses the modular structure of classical FEM
with the representational power of data-driven learning. We demonstrate how
DD-FEM addresses many of the key challenges in realizing foundation models for
computational science, including scalability, adaptability, and physics
consistency. By bridging traditional numerical methods with modern AI
paradigms, this work provides a rigorous foundation for evaluating and
developing novel approaches toward future foundation models in computational
science.

TL;DR: 论文展示了非结构化稀疏性显著提升了LLMs中KV缓存的压缩效率，支持高达70%的稀疏度且无需牺牲准确性或微调。通过系统探索剪枝策略，发现基于令牌幅度的剪枝对Key和Value缓存均非常有效，优于先前的结构化剪枝方案。研究还提出了一种基于位图的稀疏格式和自定义注意力内核，显著提升了内存密集型解码任务的性能。

Motivation: KV缓存大小是解码性能的主要瓶颈，尤其是在长上下文场景下，其高内存开销严重限制了效率。论文旨在通过优化稀疏性和压缩技术解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用非结构化稀疏性策略，包括基于令牌幅度的剪枝方法，并设计了一种位图稀疏格式和自定义注意力内核，直接支持压缩缓存的计算。

Result: KV缓存压缩至密集推理的45%，上下文长度和吞吐量分别提升至2.23倍。

Conclusion: 非结构化稀疏性和定制内核的结合为LLMs的高效推理提供了可行方案，显著提升了长上下文场景下的性能。

Abstract: We demonstrate that unstructured sparsity significantly improves KV cache
compression for LLMs, enabling sparsity levels up to 70% without compromising
accuracy or requiring fine-tuning. We conduct a systematic exploration of
pruning strategies and find per-token magnitude-based pruning as highly
effective for both Key and Value caches under unstructured sparsity, surpassing
prior structured pruning schemes. The Key cache benefits from prominent outlier
elements, while the Value cache surprisingly benefits from a simple
magnitude-based pruning despite its uniform distribution. KV cache size is the
major bottleneck in decode performance due to high memory overhead for large
context lengths. To address this, we use a bitmap-based sparse format and a
custom attention kernel capable of compressing and directly computing over
compressed caches pruned to arbitrary sparsity patterns, significantly
accelerating memory-bound operations in decode computations and thereby
compensating for the overhead of runtime pruning and compression. Our custom
attention kernel coupled with the bitmap-based format delivers substantial
compression of KV cache upto 45% of dense inference and thereby enables longer
context length and increased tokens/sec throughput of upto 2.23x compared to
dense inference. Our pruning mechanism and sparse attention kernel is available
at https://github.com/dhjoo98/mustafar.

Abstract: Fueled by their remarkable ability to tackle diverse tasks across multiple
domains, large language models (LLMs) have grown at an unprecedented rate, with
some recent models containing trillions of parameters. This growth is
accompanied by substantial computational challenges, particularly regarding the
memory and compute resources required for training and fine-tuning. Numerous
approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While
these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training
is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets.
Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can
parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while
achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the
performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are
the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that
summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform
a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training
approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We
observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank
training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that
incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving
their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely
weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of
efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to
the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular
memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using
about 25% less memory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了图扩散模型（GDMs）必须显式噪声条件化的传统观点，证明无条件的GDMs通过隐式推断噪声水平，可以实现与传统条件化模型相当甚至更好的性能，同时减少参数和计算时间。

Motivation: 研究动机在于质疑图扩散模型中显式噪声条件化的必要性，探讨去噪器是否能够直接从损坏的图结构中隐式推断噪声水平，从而简化模型架构并提高效率。

Method: 方法包括建立一个基于伯努利边翻转损坏的理论框架，并将其扩展到包含耦合结构-属性噪声的更复杂场景，同时在合成和真实图数据集上进行广泛实证评估。

Result: 结果显示，无条件GDMs在性能上与传统条件化模型相当或更优，同时减少了4-6%的参数和8-10%的计算时间。

Conclusion: 结论指出，图数据本身的高维特性通常为去噪过程提供了足够的信息，为设计更简单高效的GDM架构开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Explicit noise-level conditioning is widely regarded as essential for the
effective operation of Graph Diffusion Models (GDMs). In this work, we
challenge this assumption by investigating whether denoisers can implicitly
infer noise levels directly from corrupted graph structures, potentially
eliminating the need for explicit noise conditioning. To this end, we develop a
theoretical framework centered on Bernoulli edge-flip corruptions and extend it
to encompass more complex scenarios involving coupled structure-attribute
noise. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world graph
datasets, using models such as GDSS and DiGress, provide strong support for our
theoretical findings. Notably, unconditional GDMs achieve performance
comparable or superior to their conditioned counterparts, while also offering
reductions in parameters (4-6%) and computation time (8-10%). Our results
suggest that the high-dimensional nature of graph data itself often encodes
sufficient information for the denoising process, opening avenues for simpler,
more efficient GDM architectures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语法的方法，将DAG（有向无环图）转换为紧凑且等价的序列表示，解决了DAG解码的挑战。

Motivation: DAG在电子电路、贝叶斯网络和神经网络架构中有广泛应用，但目前缺乏一种原则性的解码方法。本文旨在通过语法方法解决这一问题。

Method: 将DAG视为一种明确语法中的推导过程，生成唯一的产生规则序列，相当于对数据进行无损压缩。

Result: 提出的方法为DAG提供了紧凑且等价的序列表示，适用于图生成、属性预测和贝叶斯优化等任务。

Conclusion: 语法方法为DAG的解码提供了原则性解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in
practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks,
and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it
remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of
a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a
grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent
sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as
derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique
sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a
description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a
representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph
generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the
sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured
data. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/induction.

Conclusion: 安全约束的图演化为鲁棒、可解释的智能体推理提供了可扩展的模块化基础。

Abstract: Despite the promise of autonomous agentic reasoning, existing workflow
generation methods frequently produce fragile, unexecutable plans due to
unconstrained LLM-driven construction. We introduce MermaidFlow, a framework
that redefines the agentic search space through safety-constrained graph
evolution. At its core, MermaidFlow represent workflows as a verifiable
intermediate representation using Mermaid, a structured and human-interpretable
graph language. We formulate domain-aware evolutionary operators, i.e.,
crossover, mutation, insertion, and deletion, to preserve semantic correctness
while promoting structural diversity, enabling efficient exploration of a
high-quality, statically verifiable workflow space. Without modifying task
settings or evaluation protocols, MermaidFlow achieves consistent improvements
in success rates and faster convergence to executable plans on the agent
reasoning benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that
safety-constrained graph evolution offers a scalable, modular foundation for
robust and interpretable agentic reasoning systems.

Conclusion: EquiReg通过正则化采样过程，显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题中的重建质量和稳定性。

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems
such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based
inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling
process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However,
due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on
isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data
manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose
Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for
regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers.
EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and
penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new
distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that
exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold
samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling
process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms
state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image
restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段优化方法，通过调整少量数据点的聚类成员身份，提升K-means聚类的公平性，实验表明在近乎不影响聚类质量的情况下显著提高公平性。

Motivation: K-means聚类算法可能存在公平性缺陷，如某些簇中敏感变量（如性别或种族）的数据点分布不均，可能导致偏见和社会问题。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：先聚类，后调整部分数据点的簇成员身份。提出两种高效算法，分别关注簇外最近数据点和高度“混合”的数据点。

Result: 在基准数据集上实验显示，公平性显著提升，且对聚类质量影响极小。

Conclusion: 该方法可轻松扩展至多种聚类算法或公平性指标，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The popular K-means clustering algorithm potentially suffers from a major
weakness for further analysis or interpretation. Some cluster may have
disproportionately more (or fewer) points from one of the subpopulations in
terms of some sensitive variable, e.g., gender or race. Such a fairness issue
may cause bias and unexpected social consequences. This work attempts to
improve the fairness of K-means clustering with a two-stage optimization
formulation--clustering first and then adjust cluster membership of a small
subset of selected data points. Two computationally efficient algorithms are
proposed in identifying those data points that are expensive for fairness, with
one focusing on nearest data points outside of a cluster and the other on
highly 'mixed' data points. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial
improvement on fairness with a minimal impact to clustering quality. The
proposed algorithms can be easily extended to a broad class of clustering
algorithms or fairness metrics.

Abstract: This paper aims to develop an energy-efficient classifier for time-series
data by introducing PatchEchoClassifier, a novel model that leverages a
reservoir-based mechanism known as the Echo State Network (ESN). The model is
designed for human activity recognition (HAR) using one-dimensional sensor
signals and incorporates a tokenizer to extract patch-level representations. To
train the model efficiently, we propose a knowledge distillation framework that
transfers knowledge from a high-capacity MLP-Mixer teacher to the lightweight
reservoir-based student model. Experimental evaluations on multiple HAR
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves over 80 percent accuracy while
significantly reducing computational cost. Notably, PatchEchoClassifier
requires only about one-sixth of the floating point operations (FLOPS) compared
to DeepConvLSTM, a widely used convolutional baseline. These results suggest
that PatchEchoClassifier is a promising solution for real-time and
energy-efficient human activity recognition in edge computing environments.

Motivation: 现有LLM后训练量化方法独立最小化激活误差，忽略了后续层的影响，导致模型输出分布与原始模型不完全一致。YAQA旨在通过全局优化量化误差来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出YAQA算法，包含两个核心组件：1) 基于Kronecker分解的全层Hessian近似计算；2) 与量化器无关的舍入算法，具备理论保证。适用于百亿参数LLM。

Result: 在多种模型和量化器上，YAQA将KL散度降低约30%，同时在下游任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 全局优化量化误差（而非局部误差）能显著提升量化模型质量，YAQA为此提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The main goal of post-training quantization (PTQ) is to produced a compressed
model whose output distribution is as close to the original model's as
possible. To do this tractably, almost all LLM PTQ algorithms quantize linear
layers by independently minimizing the immediate activation error. However,
this localized objective ignores the effect of subsequent layers, so reducing
it does not necessarily give a closer model. In this work, we introduce Yet
Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that uses
Kronecker-factored approximations of each linear layer's Hessian with respect
to the \textit{full model} KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components:
Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably
computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent
rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical
guarantees. Across a wide range of models and quantizers, YAQA empirically
reduces the KL divergence to the original model by $\approx 30\%$ while
achieving state of the art performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Finding the number of meaningful clusters in an unlabeled dataset is
important in many applications. Regularized k-means algorithm is a possible
approach frequently used to find the correct number of distinct clusters in
datasets. The most common formulation of the regularization function is the
additive linear term $\lambda k$, where $k$ is the number of clusters and
$\lambda$ a positive coefficient. Currently, there are no principled guidelines
for setting a value for the critical hyperparameter $\lambda$. In this paper,
we derive rigorous bounds for $\lambda$ assuming clusters are {\em ideal}.
Ideal clusters (defined as $d$-dimensional spheres with identical radii) are
close proxies for k-means clusters ($d$-dimensional spherically symmetric
distributions with identical standard deviations). Experiments show that the
k-means algorithm with additive regularizer often yields multiple solutions.
Thus, we also analyze k-means algorithm with multiplicative regularizer. The
consensus among k-means solutions with additive and multiplicative
regularizations reduces the ambiguity of multiple solutions in certain cases.
We also present selected experiments that demonstrate performance of the
regularized k-means algorithms as clusters deviate from the ideal assumption.

Abstract: One frequently wishes to learn a range of similar tasks as efficiently as
possible, re-using knowledge across tasks. In artificial neural networks, this
is typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by
injecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters
themselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as
serotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn
weights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.
Rather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we
optimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To
accomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as
the minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric
movement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects
a single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for
a particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.
First, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a
convenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.
Second, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging
generalization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several
topologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.
noise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their
simplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks
by input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.
These results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds
offers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.

Abstract: Bargaining, a critical aspect of real-world interactions, presents challenges

novel benchmark dataset with six intricate scenarios (e.g., deceptive
practices, monopolies) to facilitate diverse strategy modeling; (2)
human-aligned, economically-grounded evaluation metrics inspired by utility
theory, incorporating agent utility and negotiation power, which implicitly
reflect and promote opponent-aware reasoning (OAR); and (3) a structured
feedback mechanism enabling LLMs to iteratively refine their bargaining
strategies. This mechanism can positively collaborate with in-context learning
(ICL) prompts, including those explicitly designed to foster OAR. Experimental
results show that LLMs often exhibit negotiation strategies misaligned with
human preferences, and that our structured feedback mechanism significantly
improves their performance, yielding deeper strategic and opponent-aware
reasoning.

TL;DR: HYDRO是一种混合跨域鲁棒强化学习框架，通过结合在线模拟器和有限离线数据，优化样本效率，提升鲁棒性。

Motivation: 现实应用中，环境动态的不确定性使鲁棒强化学习（RL）至关重要。离线鲁棒RL需要大量数据，成本高昂；而模拟器虽然快速经济，但存在动态不匹配问题。

Method: 提出HYDRO框架，结合在线模拟器和离线数据集，通过不确定性过滤和优先采样选择最相关的模拟数据。

Conclusion: HYDRO为解决离线鲁棒RL的数据限制和模拟器动态不匹配提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that remain
effective despite uncertainties in its environment, which frequently arise in
real-world applications due to variations in environment dynamics. The robust
RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case
models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are
particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and
new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive
offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific
environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect
simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training,
but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO,
the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these
challenges. HYDRO utilizes an online simulator to complement the limited amount
of offline datasets in the non-trivial context of robust RL. By measuring and
minimizing performance gaps between the simulator and the worst-case models in
the uncertainty set, HYDRO employs novel uncertainty filtering and prioritized
sampling to select the most relevant and reliable simulator samples. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate HYDRO's superior performance over existing
methods across various tasks, underscoring its potential to improve sample
efficiency in offline robust RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QLIP是一种直接替换CLIP视觉编码器的改进模型，解决了CLIP处理固定分辨率和相似图像嵌入分离的局限性，无需重新训练即可提升多模态大语言模型的性能。

Motivation: CLIP视觉编码器存在固定输入分辨率和无法区分不相似图像嵌入的问题，限制了多模态大语言模型的表现，因此提出了QLIP作为改进方案。

Method: QLIP基于图像四叉树结构，采用内容感知的patch划分方法，替代了传统的均匀网格划分，从而提升视觉理解的粗细粒度表现。

Result: 实验表明，QLIP在不重新训练的情况下，显著提升了LLaVA v1.5系列模型的视觉问答准确性，在V*基准上精细理解性能提升达13.6%。

Conclusion: QLIP是一个简单高效的CLIP替代方案，能够显著提升多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力，无需额外训练开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encode images into visual tokens,
aligning visual and textual signals within a shared latent space to facilitate
crossmodal representation learning. The CLIP model is a widely adopted
foundational vision language model whose vision encoder has played a critical
role in the development of MLLMs such as LLaVA. However, the CLIP vision
encoder suffers from notable limitations including being constrained to only
handling fixed input resolutions and a failure to produce separated embeddings
for dissimilar images. Replacing the vision encoder of an existing model
typically incurs substantial computational costs because such a change often
necessitates retraining the entire model pipeline.
  In this work, we identify two factors which underlie the limitations of the
CLIP vision encoder: mesoscopic bias and interpolation bias. To address these
issues, we propose QLIP, a drop-in replacement for CLIP that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing MLLMs with only a few lines of code and can enhance
both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual understanding, without re-training.
QLIP is designed around an image quadtree which replaces the standard uniform
grid patches with a novel content aware patchification. Our experimental
results demonstrate that QLIP improves the general visual question answering
accuracy of the LLaVA v1.5 model series across various model sizes--without
requiring retraining or fine-tuning of the full MLLM. Notably, QLIP boosts
detailed understanding performance on the challenging $V^{\ast}$ benchmark by
up to 13.6 percent.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为 EmergentTTS-Eval 的综合TTS基准测试，涵盖六种复杂情境，并采用LLM生成测试用例及模型作为评判者的方法，展示了其在高细粒度性能评估上的有效性。

Motivation: 当前的TTS基准测试不足以评估模型处理语义复杂和细微文本的能力，因此需要一个新的全面且易扩展的基准测试框架。

Method: 通过LLM从人类编写的少量种子提示中迭代生成1,645个多样化测试用例，并用LALM模型作为评判者，从多个维度评估语音质量。

Result: 评估表明，模型作为评判者的方法能够有效区分不同TTS系统的性能，并与人类偏好高度相关。

Conclusion: EmergentTTS-Eval是一个有效的TTS评估工具，能够揭示细微性能差异，且评估结果与人类偏好一致。

Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle
nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we
introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six
challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic
complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions.
Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation,
making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of
human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target
specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645
diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a
Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple
dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation
accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems,
such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval,
demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences.
Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment
and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation

TL;DR: 通过调整初始化率和权重衰减系数控制模型复杂度，可以提升大语言模型（LLM）的泛化能力和扩展规律，实验结果证明了其有效性。

Motivation: 研究如何可靠提升大语言模型的泛化能力，探索模型复杂度控制对其扩展规律的影响。

Method: 调整初始化率和权重衰减系数来控制模型复杂度，并比较不同复杂度超参数下2.4B模型在1T token数据集上的表现。

Result: 恒定初始化率使模型扩展规律在模型和数据规模上下降更快，复杂度控制能显著提升LLM的性能。

Conclusion: 模型复杂度控制是持续提升大语言模型性能的有效方向。

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly
advancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches
that can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that
model complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the
initialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of
LLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further
illustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on
1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the
initialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent
of std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes.
These results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the
continual advancement of LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，该方法不仅具有强灵活性，还显著提升了多种谱GNN在不同图任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 双曲PDE范式为谱GNN提供了消息传递增强的新方法，兼具可解释性和性能提升。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) leverage message passing mechanisms to learn the
topological features of graph data. Traditional GNNs learns node features in a
spatial domain unrelated to the topology, which can hardly ensure topological
features. In this paper, we formulates message passing as a system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations (hyperbolic PDEs), constituting a
dynamical system that explicitly maps node representations into a particular
solution space. This solution space is spanned by a set of eigenvectors
describing the topological structure of graphs. Within this system, for any
moment in time, a node features can be decomposed into a superposition of the
basis of eigenvectors. This not only enhances the interpretability of message
passing but also enables the explicit extraction of fundamental characteristics
about the topological structure. Furthermore, by solving this system of
hyperbolic partial differential equations, we establish a connection with
spectral graph neural networks (spectral GNNs), serving as a message passing
enhancement paradigm for spectral GNNs.We further introduce polynomials to
approximate arbitrary filter functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the paradigm of hyperbolic PDEs not only exhibits strong flexibility but also
significantly enhances the performance of various spectral GNNs across diverse
graph tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法擅长短期预测，但长期预测面临非线性动态和计算效率低的问题，亟需新方法。

Method: 采用VAE框架，结合KoopmanNet线性化时间序列，KalmanNet优化预测与不确定性建模。

Result: K²VAE在短期和长期预测中均优于现有方法，显著降低误差积累。

Conclusion: K²VAE为概率时间序列预测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a crucial role in
decision-making across various fields, including economics, energy, and
transportation. Most existing methods excell at short-term forecasting, while
overlooking the hurdles of Long-term Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
(LPTSF). As the forecast horizon extends, the inherent nonlinear dynamics have
a significant adverse effect on prediction accuracy, and make generative models
inefficient by increasing the cost of each iteration. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model
that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear
dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model
uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in
long-term forecasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $K^2$VAE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term PTSF,
providing a more efficient and accurate solution.

TL;DR: SCORPIO是一种面向SLO的LLM服务系统，通过自适应调度提升系统吞吐和SLO达成率。

Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统忽视SLO（如TTFT和TPOT），导致SLO达成率不足。

Method: 采用TTFT Guard和TPOT Guard，结合预测模块，实现自适应调度。

Result: 相比基线，系统吞吐提升14.4倍，SLO达成率提高46.5%。

Conclusion: SCORPIO有效优化了LLM服务的SLO表现。

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) serving systems prioritize maximum
throughput. They often neglect Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as Time to
First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT), which leads to suboptimal
SLO attainment. This paper introduces SCORPIO, an SLO-oriented LLM serving
system designed to maximize system goodput and SLO attainment for workloads
with heterogeneous SLOs. Our core insight is to exploit SLO heterogeneity for
adaptive scheduling across admission control, queue management, and batch
selection. SCORPIO features a TTFT Guard, which employs least-deadline-first
reordering and rejects unattainable requests, and a TPOT Guard, which utilizes
a VBS-based admission control and a novel credit-based batching mechanism. Both
guards are supported by a predictive module. Evaluations demonstrate that
SCORPIO improves system goodput by up to 14.4X and SLO adherence by up to 46.5%
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习中VLM的提示学习优化提供了实用指导，促进了VLM在隐私保护环境中的广泛应用。

Abstract: The Vision Language Model (VLM) excels in aligning vision and language
representations, and prompt learning has emerged as a key technique for
adapting such models to downstream tasks. However, the application of prompt
learning with VLM in federated learning (\fl{}) scenarios remains
underexplored. This paper systematically investigates the behavioral
differences between language prompt learning (LPT) and vision prompt learning
(VPT) under data heterogeneity challenges, including label skew and domain
shift. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of various \fl{}
and prompt configurations, such as client scale, aggregation strategies, and
prompt length, to assess the robustness of Federated Prompt Learning (FPL).
Furthermore, we explore strategies for enhancing prompt learning in complex
scenarios where label skew and domain shift coexist, including leveraging both
prompt types when computational resources allow. Our findings offer practical
insights into optimizing prompt learning in federated settings, contributing to
the broader deployment of VLMs in privacy-preserving environments.

Abstract: The subpopulationtion shift, characterized by a disparity in subpopulation
distributibetween theween the training and target datasets, can significantly
degrade the performance of machine learning models. Current solutions to
subpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with
re-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on
assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on
group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,
we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk
associated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace
its standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical
classifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing
on different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation
on nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of
subpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often
outperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy. The code is

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning.
Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the
power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the
scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on
point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for
real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining
the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional
computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on
Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation.
Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of
infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws,
allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness
of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both
the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such
as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable,
uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have inspired the development of

in a graduate classroom. Unlike previous studies that primarily evaluate LEMs
using data from controlled clinical settings, our work assesses their
applicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that
distinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG
data recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The
best-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a
5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in
both accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of
the fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts.
These results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process

TL;DR: ProDiff is a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints and integrates prototype learning with a denoising diffusion model for robust reconstruction, outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: Existing methods rely on sparse trajectory data but may not retain essential patterns, while ProDiff leverages minimal endpoints and large-scale embeddings for better accuracy.

Method: ProDiff uses prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion model for spatiotemporal reconstruction, trained with a tailored loss function.

Result: ProDiff improves accuracy by 6.28% on FourSquare and 2.52% on WuXi, with a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories.

Conclusion: ProDiff demonstrates superior performance in trajectory imputation by effectively leveraging minimal input and advanced modeling techniques.

Abstract: Trajectory data is crucial for various applications but often suffers from
incompleteness due to device limitations and diverse collection scenarios.
Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information,
such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume
that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place
significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of
large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a
trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal
information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns
and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal
reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective
imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by
6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927
correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DenoiseRotator的新方法，通过重新分配参数重要性来增强LLMs的剪枝鲁棒性，显著减少性能损失。

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法主要关注单个权重的重要性评估，限制了模型关键能力的保留，尤其是在半结构化稀疏约束下性能下降显著。

Method: 通过最小化归一化重要性分数的信息熵，将重要性集中到更小的权重子集，并结合可学习正交变换（DenoiseRotator）实现。

Conclusion: DenoiseRotator是模型无关的，可与现有剪枝技术无缝集成，有效提升剪枝后的模型性能。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)
by removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant
performance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity
constraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the
importance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve
critical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:
rather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute
parameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By
minimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our
approach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby
enhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,
which applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight
matrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with
existing pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated
on LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and
zero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4
semi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the
dense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points. Codes are

Abstract: Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly
in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions
are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools
that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to
make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the
clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply
the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system
designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying
the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate
CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although
CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\%
(synthetic) and 8.7\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM
baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces
computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent
not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective
imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully
identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM
prompting approaches. Code for our work can be found at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了DINGO方法，通过动态规划解决扩散LLM在并行生成时难以满足形式约束的问题，显著提升了结构化输出的准确性。

Motivation: 当前扩散LLM虽在运行时效率上有优势，但无法可靠满足用户指定的形式约束（如正则表达式），限制了其在结构化输出任务（如JSON生成）中的应用。

Method: 提出DINGO，一种基于动态规划的约束解码策略，高效且能保持输出分布的真实性，支持在满足正则表达式约束下采样高概率输出字符串。

Result: 在符号数学和JSON生成基准测试中，DINGO对比无约束推理最高提升了68个百分点。

Conclusion: DINGO有效解决了扩散LLM的约束解码问题，为结构化输出任务提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional
autoregressive LLMs, offering significant potential for improved runtime
efficiency. However, existing diffusion models lack the ability to provably
enforce user-specified formal constraints, such as regular expressions, which
makes them unreliable for tasks that require structured outputs, such as
fixed-schema JSON generation. Unlike autoregressive models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion LLMs predict a block of tokens in parallel. This
parallelism makes traditional constrained decoding algorithms, which are
designed for sequential token prediction, ineffective at preserving the true
output distribution. To address this limitation, we propose DINGO, a dynamic
programming-based constrained decoding strategy that is both efficient and
provably distribution-preserving. DINGO enables sampling of output strings with
the highest probability under the model's predicted distribution, while
strictly satisfying any user-specified regular expression. On standard symbolic
math and JSON generation benchmarks, DINGO achieves up to a 68 percentage point
improvement over unconstrained inference

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CompFlow利用流匹配和最优传输的理论，通过建立源-目标动态的复合结构，解决了源与目标环境动态不匹配问题，并优化数据收集策略。

Motivation: 传统方法通过KL散度或互信息估计动态差异，但在源与目标动态不重叠时可能失效。

Method: CompFlow通过建模目标动态为源动态流的条件输出，利用Wasserstein距离估计差异，并引入乐观主动数据收集策略。

Result: CompFlow在动态偏移的RL基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CompFlow提供了动态差异的理论估计方法，并通过优化数据收集提升性能。

Abstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can
significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but
this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition
dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically
address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high
dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often
relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when
the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical
connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model
the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of
the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior.
This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization
for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics
gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions.
Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce
an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in
regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the
performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow
outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted
dynamics.

Motivation: 作物病害检测对农业生产力、食品安全和可持续性至关重要。尽管CNN和ViT等深度学习模型在病害分类中表现优异，但大规模部署受限于数据隐私问题。联邦学习（FL）虽缓解了隐私问题，但集中式FL存在单点故障和可扩展性限制。

Method: 提出去中心化联邦学习（DFL）框架，利用验证损失（Loss_val）指导模型共享并通过加权参数控制的自适应损失函数修正本地训练。实验使用PlantVillage数据集，测试了ResNet50、VGG16和ViT_B16三种架构，分析加权参数、共享模型数量、客户端数量及Loss_val与Loss_train的影响。

Result: DFL不仅提高了准确率和收敛速度，还增强了异构数据环境下的泛化性和鲁棒性，特别适合隐私保护的农业应用。

Conclusion: DFL框架在保护数据隐私的同时，显著提升了作物病害分类的性能，为农业领域的实际部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Crop disease detection and classification is a critical challenge in
agriculture, with major implications for productivity, food security, and
environmental sustainability. While deep learning models such as CNN and ViT
have shown excellent performance in classifying plant diseases from images,
their large-scale deployment is often limited by data privacy concerns.
Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue, but centralized FL remains
vulnerable to single-point failures and scalability limits. In this paper, we
introduce a novel Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) framework that uses
validation loss (Loss_val) both to guide model sharing between peers and to
correct local training via an adaptive loss function controlled by weighting
parameter. We conduct extensive experiments using PlantVillage datasets with
three deep learning architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT_B16), analyzing the
impact of weighting parameter, the number of shared models, the number of
clients, and the use of Loss_val versus Loss_train of other clients. Results
demonstrate that our DFL approach not only improves accuracy and convergence
speed, but also ensures better generalization and robustness across
heterogeneous data environments making it particularly well-suited for
privacy-preserving agricultural applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOGC-MML proposes a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for multi-modal learning, addressing gradient uncertainty by modeling distributions and weighting updates with quantified confidence, improving predictive accuracy.

Motivation: Existing multi-modal learning methods aggregate gradients with fixed weights, ignoring gradient uncertainty, which can lead to imbalanced updates and degraded performance.

Method: The method models each modality's gradient distribution, converts gradient precision into evidence, quantifies per-dimension uncertainties, and fuses them with a Dempster-Shafer rule for calibrated updates.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show that BOGC-MML effectively balances gradient updates and enhances model performance.

Conclusion: BOGC-MML successfully addresses gradient uncertainty in multi-modal learning, providing a more balanced and effective optimization approach.

Abstract: Multi-Modal Learning (MML) integrates information from diverse modalities to
improve predictive accuracy. However, existing methods mainly aggregate
gradients with fixed weights and treat all dimensions equally, overlooking the
intrinsic gradient uncertainty of each modality. This may lead to (i) excessive
updates in sensitive dimensions, degrading performance, and (ii) insufficient
updates in less sensitive dimensions, hindering learning. To address this
issue, we propose BOGC-MML, a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for
MML to explicitly model the gradient uncertainty and guide the model
optimization towards the optimal direction. Specifically, we first model each
modality's gradient as a random variable and derive its probability
distribution, capturing the full uncertainty in the gradient space. Then, we
propose an effective method that converts the precision (inverse variance) of
each gradient distribution into a scalar evidence. This evidence quantifies the
confidence of each modality in every gradient dimension. Using these evidences,
we explicitly quantify per-dimension uncertainties and fuse them via a reduced
Dempster-Shafer rule. The resulting uncertainty-weighted aggregation produces a
calibrated update direction that balances sensitivity and conservatism across
dimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid framework combining LSTM (Long Short-Term

framework processes time-series financial data and evaluates performance using
seven models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), vanilla LSTM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and
standard Neural Networks (NNs). Key metrics, including MAE, R-squared, MSE, and
RMSE, are used to establish benchmarks across different time scales.
  Building on these benchmarks, we develop an ensemble model that combines the
strengths of sequential and tree-based approaches. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework improves accuracy by 10 to 15 percent compared to
individual models and reduces error during market changes. This study
highlights the potential of ensemble methods for financial forecasting and
provides a flexible design for integrating new machine learning techniques.

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了“等变球面变换器（EST）”这一新框架，旨在克服现有SE(3)-等变图神经网络（GNNs）在非线性和群表示方面的局限性，通过结合Transformer与傅里叶变换提升表达能力，并在多个分子基准测试中实现先进性能。

Motivation: 现有SE(3)-等变GNNs由于基于张量积的卷积过程缺乏足够的非线性和完整的群表示，限制了其在分子系统建模中的表达能力。

Method: 提出了“等变球面变换器（EST）”，在群表示的空间域中结合Transformer结构与傅里叶变换，并通过均匀采样策略保持等变归纳偏置。

Result: 理论和实验表明，EST能够覆盖张量积的函数空间，同时表现出更优的表达力，在OC20和QM9等分子的基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EST框架通过引入Transformer与傅里叶变换，有效提升了SE(3)-等变模型的表达能力，为分子系统建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: SE(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced
molecular system modeling by employing group representations. However, their
message passing processes, which rely on tensor product-based convolutions, are
limited by insufficient non-linearity and incomplete group representations,
thereby restricting expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
the Equivariant Spherical Transformer (EST), a novel framework that leverages a
Transformer structure within the spatial domain of group representations after
Fourier transform. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that EST can
encompass the function space of tensor products while achieving superior
expressiveness. Furthermore, EST's equivariant inductive bias is guaranteed
through a uniform sampling strategy for the Fourier transform. Our experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by EST on various molecular
benchmarks, including OC20 and QM9.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的参数高效微调（PEFT）框架MAP，通过将权重矩阵重新表述为高维向量并严谨地解耦方向和幅度，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Motivation: 现有的PEFT方法（如LoRA和DoRA）在方向定义上缺乏几何基础，限制了其性能和可解释性。本文旨在提供一个更严谨且灵活的方向和幅度解耦框架。

Method: MAP将预训练权重归一化，学习方向性更新，并通过两个标量系数独立调整基础向量和更新向量的幅度，从而增强适应性和可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，MAP与现有PEFT方法结合时性能显著提升，为未来PEFT设计提供了通用且简单的增强方案。

Conclusion: MAP因其普适性和简洁性，有望成为未来PEFT方法设计的默认配置。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models has revolutionized natural
language processing, but their fine-tuning remains computationally expensive,
hindering broad deployment. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods,
such as LoRA, have emerged as solutions. Recent work like DoRA attempts to
further decompose weight adaptation into direction and magnitude components.
However, existing formulations often define direction heuristically at the
column level, lacking a principled geometric foundation. In this paper, we
propose MAP, a novel framework that reformulates weight matrices as
high-dimensional vectors and decouples their adaptation into direction and
magnitude in a rigorous manner. MAP normalizes the pre-trained weights, learns
a directional update, and introduces two scalar coefficients to independently
scale the magnitude of the base and update vectors. This design enables more
interpretable and flexible adaptation, and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments show that MAP significantly
improves performance when coupling with existing methods, offering a simple yet
powerful enhancement to existing PEFT methods. Given the universality and
simplicity of MAP, we hope it can serve as a default setting for designing
future PEFT methods.

Motivation: 传统自适应方法仅依赖历史算子性能，难以动态适应复杂问题场景，希望通过强化学习框架提升解的实时性和智能化。

Method: 结合强化学习和变邻域搜索，引入时间灵活性指标优化振动阶段，并采用基于Transformer的策略网络指导局部搜索中的算子选择。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning-based adaptive variable
neighborhood search (RL-AVNS) method designed for effectively solving the
Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Time Windows (VRPMTW). Unlike traditional
adaptive approaches that rely solely on historical operator performance, our
method integrates a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically select
neighborhood operators based on real-time solution states and learned
experience. We introduce a fitness metric that quantifies customers' temporal
flexibility to improve the shaking phase, and employ a transformer-based neural
policy network to intelligently guide operator selection during the local
search. Extensive computational experiments are conducted on realistic
scenarios derived from the replenishment of unmanned vending machines,
characterized by multiple clustered replenishment windows. Results demonstrate
that RL-AVNS significantly outperforms traditional variable neighborhood search
(VNS), adaptive VNS (AVNS), and state-of-the-art learning-based heuristics,
achieving substantial improvements in solution quality and computational
efficiency across various instance scales and time window complexities.
Particularly notable is the algorithm's capability to generalize effectively to
problem instances not encountered during training, underscoring its practical
utility for complex logistics scenarios.

Conclusion: 任务特定知识主要通过低维子空间注入，且顶部奇异方向的可学习缩放是一种高效的微调策略。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated remarkable versatility across
a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models
incurs prohibitive computational costs, motivating the development of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA, which introduces
low-rank updates to pre-trained weights. Despite their empirical success, the
underlying mechanisms by which PEFT modifies model parameters remain
underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic investigation into the
structural changes of weight matrices during fully fine-tuning. Through
singular value decomposition (SVD), we reveal that fine-tuning predominantly
amplifies the top singular values while leaving the remainder largely intact,
suggesting that task-specific knowledge is injected into a low-dimensional
subspace. Furthermore, we find that the dominant singular vectors are
reoriented in task-specific directions, whereas the non-dominant subspace
remains stable. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method that
leverages learnable rescaling of top singular directions, enabling precise
modulation of the most influential components without disrupting the global
structure. Our approach achieves consistent improvements over strong baselines
across multiple tasks, highlighting the efficacy of structurally informed
fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUMION is a reconfigurable optical fabric that dynamically integrates spare accelerators to replace failed ones in ML datacenters, avoiding costly migrations and improving performance.

Motivation: Traditional methods of migrating entire ML jobs to new racks during accelerator failures are inefficient and require idle racks. LUMION aims to address this by dynamically utilizing spare accelerators.

Method: LUMION uses a reconfigurable optical fabric to swap failed GPUs with healthy ones within the same rack, enabling rapid recovery and maintaining high bandwidth.

Result: LUMION reduces recovery time to ~1 second and nearly doubles fine-tuning throughput by improving inter-GPU bandwidth.

Conclusion: LUMION offers an efficient solution for accelerator failure recovery in ML datacenters, enhancing performance and resource utilization.

Abstract: When accelerators fail in modern ML datacenters, operators migrate the
affected ML training or inference jobs to entirely new racks. This approach,
while preserving network performance, is highly inefficient, requiring
datacenters to reserve full racks of idle accelerators for fault tolerance. In
this paper, we address this resource inefficiency by introducing LUMION, a
novel reconfigurable optical fabric for connecting accelerators within a
datacenter rack. Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically
integrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby
maintaining consistent performance without costly migrations. We show the
benefits of LUMION by building an end-to-end hardware prototype. Our
experiments fine-tune Llama 3.2 and show that LUMION swaps a failed GPU with a
healthy one and restarts the ML job within ~ 1 second of the failure. LUMION
achieves higher inter-GPU bandwidth compared to traditional electrical racks
after replacing failed accelerators with spare ones, leading to nearly 2X
improvement in fine-tuning throughput.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have emerged as transformative tools in core AI domains
such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, their largely
untapped potential for modeling intricate physical systems presents a
compelling frontier. Learning such systems often entails discovering operators
that map between functional spaces using limited instances of function pairs --
a task commonly framed as a severely ill-posed inverse PDE problem. In this
work, we introduce Neural Interpretable PDEs (NIPS), a novel neural operator
architecture that builds upon and enhances Nonlocal Attention Operators (NAO)
in both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. NIPS employs a linear
attention mechanism to enable scalable learning and integrates a learnable
kernel network that acts as a channel-independent convolution in Fourier space.
As a consequence, NIPS eliminates the need to explicitly compute and store
large pairwise interactions, effectively amortizing the cost of handling
spatial interactions into the Fourier transform. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that NIPS consistently surpasses NAO and other baselines across
diverse benchmarks, heralding a substantial leap in scalable, interpretable,
and efficient physics learning. Our code and data accompanying this paper are

Abstract: Time series forecasting with exogenous variables is a critical emerging
paradigm that presents unique challenges in modeling dependencies between
variables. Traditional models often struggle to differentiate between
endogenous and exogenous variables, leading to inefficiencies and overfitting.
In this paper, we introduce CrossLinear, a novel Linear-based forecasting model
that addresses these challenges by incorporating a plug-and-play
cross-correlation embedding module. This lightweight module captures the
dependencies between variables with minimal computational cost and seamlessly
integrates into existing neural networks. Specifically, it captures
time-invariant and direct variable dependencies while disregarding time-varying
or indirect dependencies, thereby mitigating the risk of overfitting in
dependency modeling and contributing to consistent performance improvements.
Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head
to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies,
further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12
real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance
in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study
underscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module.
Additionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in
for various forecasting tasks across different domains. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Decom-Renorm-Merge（DRM）的新方法，通过奇异值分解对齐权重矩阵，解决了现有模型合并方法忽略微调神经网络复杂性的问题，并在多种模型上表现优于现有技术。

Motivation: 现有模型合并方法假设权重矩阵中相同位置的条目功能相同，忽略了微调后神经网络的复杂性。因此，需要一种能够协调不同特征组合的合并方法。

Method: 提出DRM方法，利用奇异值分解（SVD）分解和协调权重矩阵到一个对齐的联合空间，从而支持条目级合并。

Result: DRM在多种模型（如ViT、DeBERTa、T5、Llama3.1-8B）上优于现有合并技术，特别是在完整微调和低秩适应设置中。

Conclusion: DRM通过重新归一化创建了一个鲁棒且均匀的联合空间，显著提升了合并性能。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale training, model merging has evolved into a tool for
creating multitasking models efficiently. It enables the knowledge of models to
be fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional
multitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at
identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling
straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption
overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may
develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging
problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective
approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and
coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise
merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various
settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa,
encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B.
Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art
merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.
Moreover, our analysis reveals renormalization as the crucial component for
creating a robust and even joint space for merging, significantly contributing
to the method's performance.

Method: Doppler框架包括双策略网络：一个用于选择操作（SEL策略），另一个用于将操作分配到设备（PLC策略）。

Result: 实验显示，Doppler在减少系统执行时间和每轮训练时间上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: Doppler通过结合学习方法和专家启发式设计，显著提升了复杂机器学习工作负载的执行效率。

Abstract: We study the problem of assigning operations in a dataflow graph to devices
to minimize execution time in a work-conserving system, with emphasis on
complex machine learning workloads. Prior learning-based methods often struggle
due to three key limitations: (1) reliance on bulk-synchronous systems like
TensorFlow, which under-utilize devices due to barrier synchronization; (2)
lack of awareness of the scheduling mechanism of underlying systems when
designing learning-based methods; and (3) exclusive dependence on reinforcement
learning, ignoring the structure of effective heuristics designed by experts.
In this paper, we propose \textsc{Doppler}, a three-stage framework for
training dual-policy networks consisting of 1) a $\mathsf{SEL}$ policy for
selecting operations and 2) a $\mathsf{PLC}$ policy for placing chosen
operations on devices. Our experiments show that \textsc{Doppler} outperforms
all baseline methods across tasks by reducing system execution time and
additionally demonstrates sampling efficiency by reducing per-episode training
time.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software
development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging
and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly
generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment --
offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs'
benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current
benchmarks often lack support for end-to-end verifiable code generation. In
this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a
high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code,
specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina
consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem
descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive
test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals
significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof
generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in
verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, generates only 61.4%
correct code, 51.0% sound and complete specifications, and 3.6% successful
proofs, with one trial per task. We hope Verina will catalyze progress in
verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark.
We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling and vision stem from training large
models on diverse, multi-task data. This paradigm has had limited impact in
value-based reinforcement learning (RL), where improvements are often driven by
small models trained in a single-task context. This is because in multi-task RL
sparse rewards and gradient conflicts make optimization of temporal difference
brittle. Practical workflows for generalist policies therefore avoid online
training, instead cloning expert trajectories or distilling collections of
single-task policies into one agent. In this work, we show that the use of
high-capacity value models trained via cross-entropy and conditioned on
learnable task embeddings addresses the problem of task interference in online
RL, allowing for robust and scalable multi-task training. We test our approach
on 7 multi-task benchmarks with over 280 unique tasks, spanning high
degree-of-freedom humanoid control and discrete vision-based RL. We find that,
despite its simplicity, the proposed approach leads to state-of-the-art single
and multi-task performance, as well as sample-efficient transfer to new tasks.

Motivation: 现实场景如临床试验中存在离线和在线数据不一致的问题，传统自适应算法在无偏见边界先验知识时存在局限性。

Method: 提出LUCB-H算法，通过引入辅助偏见校正和自适应置信边界，在LUCB框架内平衡离线和在线数据。

Conclusion: LUCB-H算法能有效结合离线数据，适应不同场景，具有优越性能。

Abstract: We study the best arm identification (BAI) problem with potentially biased
offline data in the fixed confidence setting, which commonly arises in
real-world scenarios such as clinical trials. We prove an impossibility result
for adaptive algorithms without prior knowledge of the bias bound between
online and offline distributions. To address this, we propose the LUCB-H
algorithm, which introduces adaptive confidence bounds by incorporating an
auxiliary bias correction to balance offline and online data within the LUCB
framework. Theoretical analysis shows that LUCB-H matches the sample complexity
of standard LUCB when offline data is misleading and significantly outperforms
it when offline data is helpful. We also derive an instance-dependent lower
bound that matches the upper bound of LUCB-H in certain scenarios. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of LUCB-H in
effectively incorporating offline data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PMDG的新框架，通过风格迁移和数据增强技术从单一源域生成多个伪域，使MDG算法能在更实际的SDG设置中应用，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Motivation: 现有的多源域泛化方法需要多域数据集，但现实中构建这样的数据集成本高且困难。因此，作者提出了PMDG框架，以解决单一源域下的域泛化问题。

Method: 采用风格迁移和数据增强技术从单一源域生成多个伪域，构成合成多域数据集，从而应用现有的MDG算法。

Conclusion: PMDG为单一源域下的域泛化提供了有效解决方案，并为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain performance when deployed on
data distributions different from their training data, particularly in
real-world applications where environmental conditions frequently change. While
Multi-source Domain Generalization (MDG) has shown promise in addressing this
challenge by leveraging multiple source domains during training, its practical
application is limited by the significant costs and difficulties associated
with creating multi-domain datasets. To address this limitation, we propose
Pseudo Multi-source Domain Generalization (PMDG), a novel framework that
enables the application of sophisticated MDG algorithms in more practical
Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) settings. PMDG generates multiple
pseudo-domains from a single source domain through style transfer and data
augmentation techniques, creating a synthetic multi-domain dataset that can be
used with existing MDG algorithms. Through extensive experiments with
PseudoDomainBed, our modified version of the DomainBed benchmark, we analyze
the effectiveness of PMDG across multiple datasets and architectures. Our
analysis reveals several key findings, including a positive correlation between
MDG and PMDG performance and the potential of pseudo-domains to match or exceed
actual multi-domain performance with sufficient data. These comprehensive
empirical results provide valuable insights for future research in domain
generalization. Our code is available at

Abstract: To improve the training efficiency of federated learning (FL), previous
research has employed low-rank decomposition techniques to reduce communication
overhead. In this paper, we seek to enhance the performance of these low-rank
decomposition methods. Specifically, we focus on three key issues related to
decomposition in FL: what to decompose, how to decompose, and how to aggregate.
Subsequently, we introduce three novel techniques: Model Update Decomposition
(MUD), Block-wise Kronecker Decomposition (BKD), and Aggregation-Aware
Decomposition (AAD), each targeting a specific issue. These techniques are
complementary and can be applied simultaneously to achieve optimal performance.
Additionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the
convergence of the proposed MUD. Extensive experimental results show that our
approach achieves faster convergence and superior accuracy compared to relevant
baseline methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对时间序列分类任务的频率域增强方法（FreRA），通过自动分离关键和非关键频率成分，优化对比学习的表示效果，并在多种任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 现有时间序列对比学习的数据增强方法主要从视觉领域借鉴，可能破坏时间序列的语义信息，因此需要一种更适应时间序列特性的增强策略。

Method: 提出频率细化增强（FreRA），通过语义感知的身份修改和语义无关的自适应修改，保护关键频率成分的语义信息，同时增加非关键成分的多样性。

Result: 在UCR、UEA等基准数据集及大规模数据集上实验表明，FreRA优于10种基线方法，在分类、异常检测和迁移学习中表现突出。

Conclusion: 频率域增强（FreRA）能有效提升时间序列对比学习的表示能力和泛化性，适配多种下游任务。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised
representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation
strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time
series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation
methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series
data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the
semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched
patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel
perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for
downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize
the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency
Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on
classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive
learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA
automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components.
Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and
semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant
information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the
unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates
semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale
datasets on diverse applications. FreRA consistently outperforms ten leading
baselines on time series classification, anomaly detection, and transfer
learning tasks, demonstrating superior capabilities in contrastive
representation learning and generalization in transfer learning scenarios
across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: FSL-SAGE是一种新型的联合分割学习方法，通过辅助模型估计服务器端梯度反馈，兼顾了通信效率和准确性。

Motivation: 传统联合学习方法（如FL和SL）存在客户端内存限制或网络延迟问题，缺乏高效且准确的解决方案，而现有并行训练方法又缺乏服务器反馈，可能导致精度不足。

Method: 提出FSL-SAGE算法，通过辅助模型周期性模拟服务器行为，估计服务器端梯度反馈，实现并行客户端训练。

Result: 理论证明了FSL-SAGE的收敛速度为$℻$℻1/℻T$℻$，其通信成本和客户端内存需求显著降低，并在实验中证明了其优于现有FSL方法。

Conclusion: FSL-SAGE在保证高精度的同时，显著减少了通信和内存开销，为大规模分布式学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative training methods like Federated Learning (FL) and Split
Learning (SL) enable distributed machine learning without sharing raw data.
However, FL assumes clients can train entire models, which is infeasible for
large-scale models. In contrast, while SL alleviates the client memory
constraint in FL by offloading most training to the server, it increases
network latency due to its sequential nature. Other methods address the
conundrum by using local loss functions for parallel client-side training to
improve efficiency, but they lack server feedback and potentially suffer poor
accuracy. We propose FSL-SAGE (Federated Split Learning via Smashed Activation
Gradient Estimation), a new federated split learning algorithm that estimates
server-side gradient feedback via auxiliary models. These auxiliary models
periodically adapt to emulate server behavior on local datasets. We show that
FSL-SAGE achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is
the number of communication rounds. This result matches FedAvg, while
significantly reducing communication costs and client memory requirements. Our
empirical results also verify that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art FSL
methods, offering both communication efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: RadarGate通过几何旋转机制有效解决了LoRA扩展中的关键问题，为LLM的规模化适配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scaling Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) facilitates
large language models (LLMs) to efficiently adapt to diverse tasks. However,
traditional gating mechanisms that route inputs to the best experts may
fundamentally hinder LLMs' scalability, leading to poor generalization and
underfitting issues. We identify that the root cause lies in the restricted
expressiveness of existing weighted-sum mechanisms, both within and outside the
convex cone of LoRA representations. This motivates us to propose RadarGate, a
novel geometrically inspired gating method that introduces rotational
operations of LoRAs representations to boost the expressiveness and facilitate
richer feature interactions among multiple LoRAs for scalable LLMs.
Specifically, we first fuse each LoRA representation to other LoRAs using a
learnable component and then feed the output to a rotation matrix. This matrix
involves learnable parameters that define the relative angular relationship
between LoRA representations. Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an
extra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and
properly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues
as the number of LoRA grows. Extensive experiments on 6 public benchmarks
across 21 tasks show the effectiveness of our RadarGate for scaling LoRAs. We
also provide valuable insights, revealing that the rotations to each pair of
representations are contrastive, encouraging closer alignment of semantically
similar representations during geometrical transformation while pushing
distance ones further apart. We will release our code to the community.

Result: 在LRGB等基准测试中，IM-MPNN显著提升了长程依赖捕捉能力并保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: IM-MPNN有效解决了MPNNs中的长程依赖问题，为图结构数据处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have become a cornerstone for
processing and analyzing graph-structured data. However, their effectiveness is
often hindered by phenomena such as over-squashing, where long-range
dependencies or interactions are inadequately captured and expressed in the
MPNN output. This limitation mirrors the challenges of the Effective Receptive
Field (ERF) in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), where the theoretical
receptive field is underutilized in practice. In this work, we show and
theoretically explain the limited ERF problem in MPNNs. Furthermore, inspired
by recent advances in ERF augmentation for CNNs, we propose an Interleaved
Multiscale Message-Passing Neural Networks (IM-MPNN) architecture to address
these problems in MPNNs. Our method incorporates a hierarchical coarsening of
the graph, enabling message-passing across multiscale representations and
facilitating long-range interactions without excessive depth or
parameterization. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as the
Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB), we demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline MPNNs in capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency.

Motivation: 标准LoRA层中矩阵A或B初始化为零，但缺乏理论支持，本研究探讨非零初始化对微调动态的影响。

Result: 非零初始化提升了对次优学习率的鲁棒性，且随机噪声不影响微调性能。

Conclusion: 微调无需严格从预训练模型开始，非零初始化是可行的。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method. In standard LoRA layers, one of the matrices, $A$ or $B$, is
initialized to zero, ensuring that fine-tuning starts from the pretrained
model. However, there is no theoretical support for this practice. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of non-zero initialization on LoRA's
fine-tuning dynamics from an infinite-width perspective. Our analysis reveals
that, compared to zero initialization, simultaneously initializing $A$ and $B$
to non-zero values improves LoRA's robustness to suboptimal learning rates,
particularly smaller ones. Further analysis indicates that although the
non-zero initialization of $AB$ introduces random noise into the pretrained
weight, it generally does not affect fine-tuning performance. In other words,
fine-tuning does not need to strictly start from the pretrained model. The
validity of our findings is confirmed through extensive experiments across
various models and datasets. The code is available at

Motivation: 尽管TSFMs在零样本预测中表现出色，但在微调后仍无法稳定超越小型专业化模型。论文旨在解决如何有效适应TSFMs以提升目标预测任务性能的问题。

Method: 通过实证研究发现TSFMs具有计算稀疏性和冗余性，提出结构化剪枝方法，以保留先验知识并集中在更相关的参数空间进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，经过剪枝和微调的较小TSFM在六个基准测试中显著优于原始模型，甚至达到最先进水平，超越专业基线。

Conclusion: “先剪枝后微调”的方法能有效提升TSFMs的预测性能，使其在多种任务中超越传统专业模型。

Abstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models
(TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot
forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot
consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot
downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs
for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the
pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in
computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant
network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve
this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to
regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant
and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six
benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly
improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This
"prune-then-finetune" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Daunce方法，一种通过不确定性估计实现数据归因的简单有效方法，适用于大规模语言模型，并验证了其在视觉任务和LLM微调中的准确性和适用性。

Motivation: 现有的梯度数据归因方法在可扩展性上存在限制，而随机投影方法在准确性上有所下降。因此，研究者希望通过结合不确定性和影响函数的概念，提出一种更高效、准确的数据归因方法。

Method: Daunce方法通过微调一组扰动模型，计算这些模型上每个样本损失的协方差作为归因分数，实现了可扩展且准确的训练数据归因。

Result: 实验验证了Daunce在大规模语言模型（如GPT）上的有效性，首次实现了对专有LLM的数据归因，且在归因准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Daunce是一种简单、高效且可扩展的数据归因方法，适用于多种任务和模型，包括黑盒模型。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to identify which training
examples influence a model's predictions on specific test data most. By
quantifying these influences, TDA supports critical applications such as data
debugging, curation, and valuation. Gradient-based TDA methods rely on
gradients and second-order information, limiting their applicability at scale.
While recent random projection-based methods improve scalability, they often
suffer from degraded attribution accuracy. Motivated by connections between
uncertainty and influence functions, we introduce Daunce - a simple yet
effective data attribution approach through uncertainty estimation. Our method
operates by fine-tuning a collection of perturbed models and computing the
covariance of per-example losses across these models as the attribution score.
Daunce is scalable to large language models (LLMs) and achieves more accurate
attribution compared to existing TDA methods. We validate Daunce on tasks
ranging from vision tasks to LLM fine-tuning, and further demonstrate its
compatibility with black-box model access. Applied to OpenAI's GPT models, our
method achieves, to our knowledge, the first instance of data attribution on
proprietary LLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between model generalization
and counterfactual explainability in supervised learning. We introduce the
notion of $\varepsilon$-valid counterfactual probability ($\varepsilon$-VCP) --
the probability of finding perturbations of a data point within its
$\varepsilon$-neighborhood that result in a label change. We provide a
theoretical analysis of $\varepsilon$-VCP in relation to the geometry of the
model's decision boundary, showing that $\varepsilon$-VCP tends to increase
with model overfitting. Our findings establish a rigorous connection between
poor generalization and the ease of counterfactual generation, revealing an
inherent trade-off between generalization and counterfactual explainability.
Empirical results validate our theory, suggesting $\varepsilon$-VCP as a
practical proxy for quantitatively characterizing overfitting.

Abstract: The rapid growth in feature dimension may introduce implicit associations
between features and labels in multi-label datasets, making the relationships
between features and labels increasingly complex. Moreover, existing methods
often adopt low-dimensional linear decomposition to explore the associations
between features and labels. However, linear decomposition struggles to capture
complex nonlinear associations and may lead to misalignment between the feature
space and the label space. To address these two critical challenges, we propose
innovative solutions. First, we design a random walk graph that integrates
feature-feature, label-label, and feature-label relationships to accurately
capture nonlinear and implicit indirect associations, while optimizing the
latent representations of associations between features and labels after
low-rank decomposition. Second, we align the variable spaces by leveraging
low-dimensional representation coefficients, while preserving the manifold
structure between the original high-dimensional multi-label data and the
low-dimensional representation space. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies conducted on seven benchmark datasets and three representative datasets
using various evaluation metrics demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
method\footnote{Code: https://github.com/Heilong623/-GRW-}.

Result: 发现随机和确定性策略的梯度、自然梯度和状态价值函数相同，但状态控制价值函数不同。

Conclusion: 通过近似状态价值函数而非状态控制价值函数，可以统一策略梯度方法。

Abstract: Policy gradients in continuous control have been derived for both stochastic
and deterministic policies. Here we study the relationship between the two. In
a widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic
control costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients,
natural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the
state-control value functions are different. We then develop a general
procedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent
to a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the
sufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP. Our results
suggest that policy gradient methods can be unified by approximating state
value functions rather than state-control value functions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种新的方法来衡量去中心化联邦学习（DFL）中参与者的贡献，解决了现有方法仅适用于中心化联邦学习（CFL）的问题。

Motivation: 在去中心化联邦学习中，缺乏有效的参与者贡献衡量方法，现有方法无法直接应用。

Method: 提出了DFL-Shapley（基于Shapley值的扩展）和DFL-MR（可计算的近似方法）来衡量贡献。

Result: 实验验证了DFL-Shapley的有效性，并显示DFL-MR能够接近DFL-Shapley的准确性。

Conclusion: DFL-Shapley和DFL-MR为DFL提供了一种有效的贡献衡量方法，弥补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
models without sharing their data. Measuring participant contributions in FL is
crucial for incentivizing clients and ensuring transparency. While various
methods have been proposed for contribution measurement, they are designed
exclusively for centralized federated learning (CFL), where a central server
collects and aggregates client models, along with evaluating their
contributions. Meanwhile, decentralized federated learning (DFL), in which
clients exchange models directly without a central server, has gained
significant attention for mitigating communication bottlenecks and eliminating
a single point of failure. However, applying existing contribution measurement
methods to DFL is challenging due to the presence of multiple global models and
the absence of a central server. In this study, we present novel methodologies
for measuring participant contributions in DFL. We first propose DFL-Shapley,
an extension of the Shapley value tailored for DFL, adapting this widely used
CFL metric to decentralized settings. Given the impracticality of computing the
ideal DFL-Shapley in real-world systems, we introduce DFL-MR, a computable
approximation that estimates overall contributions by accumulating round-wise
Shapley values. We evaluate DFL-Shapley and DFL-MR across various FL scenarios
and compare them with existing CFL metrics. The experimental results confirm
DFL-Shapley as a valid ground-truth metric and demonstrate DFL-MR's proximity
to DFL-Shapley across various settings, highlighting their effectiveness as
contribution metrics in DFL.

Motivation: 当前GRPO-based RLHF训练效率不足，研究发现初始政策模型的奖励方差较高可加速训练，因此提出一种奖励调整方法来提高方差并保持偏好和期望不变。

Method: 设计了一种非凸优化模型，通过明确表征可行集的极值点，提出O(n log n)算法求解全局最优解，并将其集成到GRPO算法中，形成GRPOVI算法。

Result: 实验证明GRPOVI算法比原始GRPO算法显著提高了RLHF训练效率。

Conclusion: 提出的奖励调整方法和GRPOVI算法有效解决了RLHF训练效率问题，并为规则奖励的GRPO有效性提供了解释。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an essential technique
for ensuring that large language models (LLMs) are aligned with human values
and preferences during the post-training phase. As an effective RLHF approach,
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many
LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a
challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial
policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we
propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by
provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences
and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a
nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To
overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \log n)$
algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by
explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an
important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into
the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance
increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we
provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with
rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment
results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the
RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.

Conclusion: 新方法不仅高效且准确，还首次通过数值实验验证了PF-ODE推导图的最优传输性质。

Abstract: Recent Diffusion models (DMs) advancements have explored incorporating the
second-order diffusion Fisher information (DF), defined as the negative Hessian
of log density, into various downstream tasks and theoretical analysis.
However, current practices typically approximate the diffusion Fisher by
applying auto-differentiation to the learned score network. This black-box
method, though straightforward, lacks any accuracy guarantee and is
time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the diffusion Fisher actually
resides within a space spanned by the outer products of score and initial data.
Based on the outer-product structure, we develop two efficient approximation
algorithms to access the trace and matrix-vector multiplication of DF,
respectively. These algorithms bypass the auto-differentiation operations with
time-efficient vector-product calculations. Furthermore, we establish the
approximation error bounds for the proposed algorithms. Experiments in
likelihood evaluation and adjoint optimization demonstrate the superior
accuracy and reduced computational cost of our proposed algorithms.
Additionally, based on the novel outer-product formulation of DF, we design the
first numerical verification experiment for the optimal transport property of
the general PF-ODE deduced map.

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their
capabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require
extensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain
sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising
concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to
request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the
development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific
knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these
advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a
challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this
work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning
evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and
five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we
evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.
To explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel
technique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the
limitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.

covers, such as water bodies, crops, urban, etc. The constructed model was
subsequently applied within the study region, allowing for an effective
comparative evaluation of LULC changes within the given timeframe.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于生成模型的CI测试提供了新的思路，具有较高的实用价值。

Abstract: Determining conditional independence (CI) relationships between random
variables is a fundamental yet challenging task in machine learning and
statistics, especially in high-dimensional settings. Existing generative
model-based CI testing methods, such as those utilizing generative adversarial
networks (GANs), often struggle with undesirable modeling of conditional
distributions and training instability, resulting in subpar performance. To
address these issues, we propose a novel CI testing method via score-based
generative modeling, which achieves precise Type I error control and strong
testing power. Concretely, we first employ a sliced conditional score matching
scheme to accurately estimate conditional score and use Langevin dynamics
conditional sampling to generate null hypothesis samples, ensuring precise Type
I error control. Then, we incorporate a goodness-of-fit stage into the method
to verify generated samples and enhance interpretability in practice. We
theoretically establish the error bound of conditional distributions modeled by
score-based generative models and prove the validity of our CI tests. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, providing a
promising way to revitalize generative model-based CI testing.

Motivation: 传统的BNCs学习方法性能较差，而HDPs平滑技术虽能提升性能，但复杂且不灵活。本文旨在开发一种更简单、灵活且高效的参数估计方法。

Method: 使用对数线性回归近似HDPs的行为，利用线性模型的灵活性和简单性来优化参数估计。

Conclusion: 对数线性回归方法为BNCs提供了一种高效、灵活的参数估计方案，性能优于传统HDP平滑方法。

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers (BNCs) possess a number of properties desirable
for a modern classifier: They are easily interpretable, highly scalable, and
offer adaptable complexity. However, traditional methods for learning BNCs have
historically underperformed when compared to leading classification methods
such as random forests. Recent parameter smoothing techniques using
hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) have enabled BNCs to achieve
performance competitive with random forests on categorical data, but these
techniques are relatively inflexible, and require a complicated, specialized
sampling process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for parameter
estimation that uses a log-linear regression to approximate the behaviour of
HDPs. As a linear model, our method is remarkably flexible and simple to
interpret, and can leverage the vast literature on learning linear models. Our
experiments show that our method can outperform HDP smoothing while being
orders of magnitude faster, remaining competitive with random forests on
categorical data.

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving

development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple
accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are
larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow
Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more
domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be
extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our
methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower
serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary
datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests
within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric.
We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve

Motivation: 传统的图自编码器（GAEs）通过节点或边掩码主要捕获低频信号，但忽略了表达性结构信息。为弥补这一缺陷，本文提出了改进方法。

Method: GraphPAE采用双路径架构：特征路径通过位置编码增强消息传递；位置路径利用节点表示优化位置并逼近特征向量，学习多样化频率信息。

Conclusion: GraphPAE通过同时学习特征和位置信息，有效提升了图自监督学习的表达能力和性能。

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning seeks to learn effective graph representations
without relying on labeled data. Among various approaches, graph autoencoders
(GAEs) have gained significant attention for their efficiency and scalability.
Typically, GAEs take incomplete graphs as input and predict missing elements,
such as masked nodes or edges. While effective, our experimental investigation
reveals that traditional node or edge masking paradigms primarily capture
low-frequency signals in the graph and fail to learn the expressive structural
information. To address these issues, we propose Graph Positional Autoencoders
(GraphPAE), which employs a dual-path architecture to reconstruct both node
features and positions. Specifically, the feature path uses positional encoding
to enhance the message-passing processing, improving GAE's ability to predict
the corrupted information. The position path, on the other hand, leverages node
representations to refine positions and approximate eigenvectors, thereby
enabling the encoder to learn diverse frequency information. We conduct
extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of GraphPAE, including
heterophilic node classification, graph property prediction, and transfer
learning. The results demonstrate that GraphPAE achieves state-of-the-art
performance and consistently outperforms baselines by a large margin.

TL;DR: 本文提出Sentinel框架，通过两阶段调度（预调度和后调度）主动检测异常并优化流调度，显著减少异常频率、提高收入及调度速度。

Motivation: 直播流服务的快速增长使得众包云边平台（CCPs）需求激增，但现有调度策略因异常检测困难难以实现优化效果，亟需一种高效解决方案。

Method: 提出Sentinel框架，采用两阶段调度模式：预调度阶段进行异常检测并构建策略池；后调度阶段根据请求触发预生成策略完成调度。

Result: 实验显示Sentinel将异常频率降低70%，收入提升74%，调度速度翻倍。

Conclusion: Sentinel通过主动异常检测与两阶段调度，显著提升CCPs的稳定性和收益，适用于大规模实时调度场景。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge
service Platforms (CCPs) are playing an increasingly important role in meeting
the increasing demand. Although stream scheduling plays a critical role in
optimizing CCPs' revenue, most optimization strategies struggle to achieve
practical results due to various anomalies in unstable CCPs. Additionally, the
substantial scale of CCPs magnifies the difficulties of anomaly detection in
time-sensitive scheduling. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes
Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel
models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in
the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a
strategy pool; in the post-scheduling stage, upon request arrival, it triggers
an appropriate scheduling based on a pre-generated strategy to implement the
scheduling process. Extensive experiments on realistic datasets show that
Sentinel significantly reduces anomaly frequency by 70%, improves revenue by
74%, and doubles the scheduling speed.

Abstract: Rewards serve as proxies for human preferences and play a crucial role in

the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively
define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward
unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward
fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing
for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model
preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as
resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and
fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization
and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods
in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness
reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these
scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a
more fair manner.

Abstract: Climate control is crucial for greenhouse production as it directly affects
crop growth and resource use. Reinforcement learning (RL) has received
increasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including
limited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions.
Interactive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's
learning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However,
interactive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may
face challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to
explore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with
imperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three
representative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate
control (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how
input characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between
them make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural
network-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under
limited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the
three interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse
environment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating
imperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL
agent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping
and control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,
achieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively. In contrast,
reward shaping, an algorithm that manipulates the reward function, is sensitive
to imperfect inputs and leads to a 9.4% decrease in profit. This highlights the
importance of selecting an appropriate mechanism when incorporating imperfect
inputs.

Abstract: Speaker-dependent modelling can substantially improve performance in
speech-based health monitoring applications. While mixed-effect models are
commonly used for such speaker adaptation, they require computationally
expensive retraining for each new observation, making them impractical in a
production environment. We reformulate this task as a meta-learning problem and
explore three approaches of increasing complexity: ensemble-based distance
models, prototypical networks, and transformer-based sequence models. Using
pre-trained speech embeddings, we evaluate these methods on a large
longitudinal dataset of shift workers (N=1,185, 10,286 recordings), predicting
time since sleep from speech as a function of fatigue, a symptom commonly
associated with ill-health. Our results demonstrate that all meta-learning
approaches tested outperformed both cross-sectional and conventional
mixed-effects models, with a transformer-based method achieving the strongest
performance.

Abstract: Modeling propagation is the cornerstone for designing and optimizing
next-generation wireless systems, with a particular emphasis on 5G and beyond
era. Traditional modeling methods have long relied on statistic-based
techniques to characterize propagation behavior across different environments.
With the expansion of wireless communication systems, there is a growing demand
for methods that guarantee the accuracy and interoperability of modeling.
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, in particular, are increasingly
being adopted to overcome this challenge, although the interpretability is not
assured with most of these methods. Inspired by recent advancements in AI, this
paper proposes a novel approach that accelerates the discovery of path loss
models while maintaining interpretability. The proposed method automates the
model formulation, evaluation, and refinement, facilitating model discovery. We
evaluate two techniques: one based on Deep Symbolic Regression, offering full
interpretability, and the second based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, providing
two levels of interpretability. Both approaches are evaluated on two synthetic
and two real-world datasets. Our results show that Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
achieve R^2 values close to 1 with minimal prediction error, while Deep
Symbolic Regression generates compact models with moderate accuracy. Moreover,
on the selected examples, we demonstrate that automated methods outperform
traditional methods, achieving up to 75% reduction in prediction errors,
offering accurate and explainable solutions with potential to increase the
efficiency of discovering next-generation path loss models.

Conclusion: 研究方法为设计高效且保护隐私的开放世界类增量学习系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) poses significant challenges in open-world
scenarios, where models must not only learn new classes over time without
forgetting previous ones but also handle inputs from unknown classes that a
closed-set model would misclassify. Recent works address both issues by
(i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework,
and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD)
detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a
memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and
increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of
post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the
need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied
appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for
buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves
comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of
class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples. Experimental
results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets support our findings,
offering new insights into the design of efficient and privacy-preserving CIL
systems for open-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双向预测编码（bPC）模型，结合了生成和判别推理，在多种视觉任务中表现优于单向模型。

Motivation: 现有的预测编码模型多为单向（生成或判别），而实验证据表明大脑需双向处理，因此需要开发一种更生物合理的双向模型。

Method: 提出了双向预测编码（bPC），通过构建同时适合生成和判别任务的能量景观，实现双向推理。

Result: bPC在生成和判别任务中表现优于单向模型，在多模态学习和信息缺失推理任务中展现出更强性能。

Conclusion: bPC更接近生物视觉推理机制，为理解大脑视觉处理提供了新的计算模型。

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual
learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down
generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and
inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that
PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict
neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence
suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference,
while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring
bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC
model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while
maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC
matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or
discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously
suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two
biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with
missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference
more closely.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多任务优化-预测-再优化（OTPTO）方法，用于中国生鲜电商前端仓库的库存管理，显著提高了订单满足率。

Motivation: 在竞争激烈的生鲜电商市场中，前端仓库的库存管理是关键挑战。传统预测再优化（PTO）方法未能有效结合预测与库存目标，且忽视了消费者满意度。

Method: 采用OTPTO方法，结合0-1混合整数规划模型（OM1）确定历史最优库存，再通过产品选择模型（PM1）和库存模型（PM2）进行预测，并通过后处理算法（OM2）优化结果。

Abstract: In China's competitive fresh e-commerce market, optimizing operational
strategies, especially inventory management in front-end warehouses, is key to
enhance customer satisfaction and to gain a competitive edge. Front-end
warehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of
fresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of
deciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account
capacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize
(PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align
prediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer
satisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task
Optimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes
product selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer
satisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs
a 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal
inventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking
model PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a
post-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh
platform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO
method. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances
the full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and
narrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These
findings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at
front-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable
insights for future research in this domain.

TL;DR: DACER2通过引入Q梯度场目标和时间加权机制，显著提升了扩散模型在在线强化学习中的训练和推理效率，同时保持了或增强了性能，特别是在多模态任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 扩散模型在离线强化学习和模仿学习中表现出色，但在在线RL中因需要大量扩散步骤导致效率低下，直接减少步骤又会降低性能，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出Q梯度场目标作为辅助优化目标，并引入时间加权机制来指导每个扩散步骤的去噪过程。

Conclusion: DACER2通过创新方法显著提升了扩散策略的效率与性能，适用于实时在线RL场景。

Abstract: Due to their expressive capacity, diffusion models have shown great promise
in offline RL and imitation learning. Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy
Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse
diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy
gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost
of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training
efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance
degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant
bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To
improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing
performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary
optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step.
Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the
diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy.
To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the
model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine
actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and
several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves
state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five
diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to
DACER.

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用头部运动基础单元（kinemes）作为抑郁症严重程度评估的生物标志，通过多数据集验证提升了模型的泛化能力。结果表明，kineme特征在分类和回归任务中表现优异且泛化性更强。

Motivation: 抑郁症严重影响全球数百万人，现有研究较少关注头部运动的评估作用，且单一数据集验证限制了模型的泛化性。本文旨在探索kinemes的有效性和跨数据集泛化能力。

Method: 采用三个西方文化背景的抑郁症数据集（德国AVEC2013、澳大利亚Blackdog、美国Pitt），通过两种方法验证：(1) 单/多数据集的k折交叉验证，(2) 数据集间的模型复用，评估经典机器学习方法的分类和回归性能。

Result: 头部运动模式是有效的抑郁症严重程度生物标志：(1) 在分类和回归任务中表现优异，如AVEC2013数据集的MAE第二优；(2) kineme特征比原始头部运动描述符（分类）和其他视觉行为线索（回归）更具泛化性。

Conclusion: kinemes作为跨文化数据集的头部运动特征，能显著提升抑郁症评估的泛化性和性能，为自动化诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Depression is a debilitating mood disorder negatively impacting millions
worldwide. While researchers have explored multiple verbal and non-verbal
behavioural cues for automated depression assessment, head motion has received
little attention thus far. Further, the common practice of validating machine
learning models via a single dataset can limit model generalisability. This
work examines the effectiveness and generalisability of models utilising
elementary head motion units, termed kinemes, for depression severity
estimation. Specifically, we consider three depression datasets from different
western cultures (German: AVEC2013, Australian: Blackdog and American: Pitt
datasets) with varied contextual and recording settings to investigate the
generalisability of the derived kineme patterns via two methods: (i) k-fold
cross-validation over individual/multiple datasets, and (ii) model reuse on
other datasets. Evaluating classification and regression performance with
classical machine learning methods, our results show that: (1) head motion
patterns are efficient biomarkers for estimating depression severity, achieving
highly competitive performance for both classification and regression tasks on
a variety of datasets, including achieving the second best Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) on the AVEC2013 dataset, and (2) kineme-based features are more
generalisable than (a) raw head motion descriptors for binary severity
classification, and (b) other visual behavioural cues for severity estimation
(regression).

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced
rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek R1, which has inspired
a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on
LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work
presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based
training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy
optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong
positive correlation between the solution diversity and Potential at k (a novel
metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models.
This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL
training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it
into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples.
Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5
percent average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
while generating more diverse and robust solutions.

Abstract: Ranking systems influence decision-making in high-stakes domains like health,
education, and employment, where they can have substantial economic and social
impacts. This makes the integration of safety mechanisms essential. One such
mechanism is $\textit{abstention}$, which enables algorithmic decision-making
system to defer uncertain or low-confidence decisions to human experts. While
abstention have been predominantly explored in the context of classification
tasks, its application to other machine learning paradigms remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for abstention in
pairwise learning-to-rank tasks. Our approach is based on thresholding the
ranker's conditional risk: the system abstains from making a decision when the
estimated risk exceeds a predefined threshold. Our contributions are threefold:
a theoretical characterization of the optimal abstention strategy, a
model-agnostic, plug-in algorithm for constructing abstaining ranking models,
and a comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Method: 提出SPR稀疏正则化方法，选择性地惩罚嵌入向量中显著特征，减少噪声影响。

Result: 实验表明SPR优于其他正则化方法，能够突破模型原有效能上限。

Conclusion: 精心设计的正则化方法可以显著提升KGC模型的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted considerable attention in
recent years because it is critical to improving the quality of knowledge
graphs. Researchers have continuously explored various models. However, most
previous efforts have neglected to take advantage of regularization from a
deeper perspective and therefore have not been used to their full potential.
This paper rethinks the application of regularization methods in KGC. Through
extensive empirical studies on various KGC models, we find that carefully
designed regularization not only alleviates overfitting and reduces variance
but also enables these models to break through the upper bounds of their
original performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization
method that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC
regularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with
significant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many
components that contribute little and may only represent noise. Various
comparative experiments on multiple datasets and multiple models show that the
SPR regularization method is better than other regularization methods and can
enable the KGC model to further break through the performance margin.

Method: 采用自底向上的方法，分析非线性如何影响决策边界点、分类器表达能力及模型类的复杂度。

Conclusion: 结论指出，非线性分类器在战略分类中的表现与标准学习环境不同，对模型选择和设计提出了新挑战。

Abstract: In strategic classification, the standard supervised learning setting is
extended to support the notion of strategic user behavior in the form of costly
feature manipulations made in response to a classifier. While standard learning
supports a broad range of model classes, the study of strategic classification
has, so far, been dedicated mostly to linear classifiers. This work aims to
expand the horizon by exploring how strategic behavior manifests under
non-linear classifiers and what this implies for learning. We take a bottom-up
approach showing how non-linearity affects decision boundary points, classifier
expressivity, and model classes complexity. A key finding is that universal
approximators (e.g., neural nets) are no longer universal once the environment
is strategic. We demonstrate empirically how this can create performance gaps
even on an unrestricted model class.

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和可解释性，无需额外OOD数据或后处理技术，实现了OOD检测与UE的统一解决。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and uncertainty estimation (UE) are
critical components for building safe machine learning systems, especially in
real-world scenarios where unexpected inputs are inevitable. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that combines network inversion with classifier
training to simultaneously address both OOD detection and uncertainty
estimation. For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the
classifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a "garbage" class, initially
populated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each
training epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images
corresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and
incoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the
classifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues
iteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution
data more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out
meaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing
OOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme
enables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying
them into the garbage class. Furthermore, the confidence scores associated with
each prediction can be used to estimate uncertainty for both in-distribution
and OOD inputs. Our approach is scalable, interpretable, and does not require
access to external OOD datasets or post-hoc calibration techniques while
providing a unified solution to the dual challenges of OOD detection and
uncertainty estimation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CFGRL框架，通过将策略改进与扩散模型的引导相结合，在简化训练的同时提升离线强化学习任务的性能，且在无需显式学习价值函数的情况下实现优化。

Motivation: 解决强化学习系统难以扩展的问题，通过结合生成模型的优势，简化训练流程并提升性能。

Method: 提出CFGRL框架，将策略改进与扩散模型引导直接关联，利用监督学习的简单性训练，并在数据中的策略基础上进一步优化。

Result: 实验显示，在离线强化学习任务中，增加引导权重可提升性能；CFGRL无需显式学习价值函数，即可通过监督方法（如目标条件行为克隆）实现优化。

Conclusion: CFGRL成功结合了强化学习和生成模型的优势，简化了训练流程，显著提升了性能并扩展了应用场景。

Abstract: At the core of reinforcement learning is the idea of learning beyond the
performance in the data. However, scaling such systems has proven notoriously
tricky. In contrast, techniques from generative modeling have proven remarkably
scalable and are simple to train. In this work, we combine these strengths, by
deriving a direct relation between policy improvement and guidance of diffusion
models. The resulting framework, CFGRL, is trained with the simplicity of
supervised learning, yet can further improve on the policies in the data. On
offline RL tasks, we observe a reliable trend -- increased guidance weighting
leads to increased performance. Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate
without explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple
supervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further
prioritize optimality, gaining performance for "free" across the board.

Conclusion: FedPG和b-RS-FedPG在异质性环境下表现优异，具有线性加速特性。

Abstract: Ensuring convergence of policy gradient methods in federated reinforcement
learning (FRL) under environment heterogeneity remains a major challenge. In
this work, we first establish that heterogeneity, perhaps counter-intuitively,
can necessitate optimal policies to be non-deterministic or even time-varying,
even in tabular environments. Subsequently, we prove global convergence results
for federated policy gradient (FedPG) algorithms employing local updates, under
a {\L}ojasiewicz condition that holds only for each individual agent, in both
entropy-regularized and non-regularized scenarios. Crucially, our theoretical
analysis shows that FedPG attains linear speed-up with respect to the number of
agents, a property central to efficient federated learning. Leveraging insights
from our theoretical findings, we introduce b-RS-FedPG, a novel policy gradient
method that employs a carefully constructed softmax-inspired parameterization
coupled with an appropriate regularization scheme. We further demonstrate
explicit convergence rates for b-RS-FedPG toward near-optimal stationary
policies. Finally, we demonstrate that empirically both FedPG and b-RS-FedPG
consistently outperform federated Q-learning on heterogeneous settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于少量标注数据修复标签函数（LFs）的问题，提出了一种通过最小化修改LFs输出的方法，提升标签质量。

Motivation: 现有程序化弱监督（PWS）依赖用户提供的LFs生成标签，但LFs的准确性直接影响标签质量。当仅有少量标注数据时，如何高效修复LFs是一大挑战。

Method: 将LFs建模为条件规则，通过选择性修改输入输出对来最小化变更，确保修复后的LFs既支持标注数据的正确标签，又保持足够高的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能在极少量标注数据下显著提升LFs的质量。

Conclusion: 通过条件规则的细粒度修复，实现了LFs在小规模标注数据下的高效优化，为弱监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) significantly reduces human effort for
labeling data by combining the outputs of user-provided labeling functions
(LFs) on unlabeled datapoints. However, the quality of the generated labels
depends directly on the accuracy of the LFs. In this work, we study the problem
of fixing LFs based on a small set of labeled examples. Towards this goal, we
develop novel techniques for repairing a set of LFs by minimally changing their
results on the labeled examples such that the fixed LFs ensure that (i) there
is sufficient evidence for the correct label of each labeled datapoint and (ii)
the accuracy of each repaired LF is sufficiently high. We model LFs as
conditional rules which enables us to refine them, i.e., to selectively change
their output for some inputs. We demonstrate experimentally that our system
improves the quality of LFs based on surprisingly small sets of labeled
datapoints.

TL;DR: 通过热力学框架解释SGD固定学习率下的行为，发现其隐含最小化自由能，平衡训练损失和权重分布熵，且学习率决定‘温度’。

Motivation: 揭示SGD在神经网络训练中的行为机制，特别是高学习率阻碍收敛的原因，以及学习率如何影响损失函数稳定性。

Method: 提出热力学视角（自由能最小化），并通过实验验证理论，包括欠参数化（UP）和过参数化（OP）模型的行为差异。

Result: UP模型中‘温度’随学习率单调上升，遵循自由能最小化；OP模型在低学习率时‘温度’趋零，直接最小化损失至最优。

Conclusion: SGD行为可通过自由能框架统一解释，UP与OP模型的差异源于随机梯度信噪比的不同。

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic interpretation of the stationary behavior of
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under fixed learning rates (LRs) in neural
network training. We show that SGD implicitly minimizes a free energy function
$F=U-TS$, balancing training loss $U$ and the entropy of the weights
distribution $S$, with temperature $T$ determined by the LR. This perspective
offers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss
minima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We
empirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP)
and overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy
minimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP
models, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to
minimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum. We attribute this
mismatch to differences in the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic gradients
near optima, supported by both a toy example and neural network experiments.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解认知误差和负迁移提供了新视角，适用于多任务学习和分布偏移等复杂场景。

Abstract: When data are noisy, a statistical learner's goal is to resolve epistemic
uncertainty about the data it will encounter at test-time, i.e., to identify
the distribution of test (target) data. Many real-world learning settings
introduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the
basis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple
tasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the
source data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an
accurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce
a principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic,
decompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i)
consider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of
epistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each
of multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries
of the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the
settings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within
$\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization
bounds. Finally, we provide a novel definition of negative transfer, and
validate its insights in a synthetic experimental setting.

Method: 通过更细粒度的认知不确定性分类和偏差-方差分解，结合仿真实验评估现有方法。

Result: 发现高模型偏差会误导认知不确定性估计，现有方法常将偏差相关错误归为偶然不确定性。

Conclusion: 只有在充分表示所有认知不确定性来源后，才能获得有意义的偶然不确定性估计。

Abstract: In recent years various supervised learning methods that disentangle
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty based on second-order distributions have
been proposed. We argue that these methods fail to capture critical components
of epistemic uncertainty, particularly due to the often-neglected component of
model bias. To show this, we make use of a more fine-grained taxonomy of
epistemic uncertainty sources in machine learning models, and analyse how the
classical bias-variance decomposition of the expected prediction error can be
decomposed into different parts reflecting these uncertainties. By using a
simulation-based evaluation protocol which encompasses epistemic uncertainty
due to both procedural- and data-driven uncertainty components, we illustrate
that current methods rarely capture the full spectrum of epistemic uncertainty.
Through theoretical insights and synthetic experiments, we show that high model
bias can lead to misleadingly low estimates of epistemic uncertainty, and
common second-order uncertainty quantification methods systematically blur
bias-induced errors into aleatoric estimates, thereby underrepresenting
epistemic uncertainty. Our findings underscore that meaningful aleatoric
estimates are feasible only if all relevant sources of epistemic uncertainty
are properly represented.

TL;DR: AnchorAttention是一种动态稀疏注意力机制，通过更细粒度的条纹稀疏识别和全局上下文适应，显著提升大型语言模型的预填充阶段效率。

Motivation: 解决现有动态模式匹配和块稀疏方法因依赖局部信息和粗粒度块导致的计算效率与准确度不足的问题。

Method: 提出AnchorAttention，包含基于模式的锚计算、差异感知条纹稀疏识别和细粒度稀疏计算三个关键组件。

Result: 在128k文本长度下实现1.44倍加速，同时保持更高的召回率。

Conclusion: AnchorAttention在细粒度稀疏策略下，显著提升了计算效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context lengths face significant
computational challenges during the pre-filling phase, primarily due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. Existing methods typically employ
dynamic pattern matching and block-sparse low-level implementations. However,
their reliance on local information for pattern identification fails to capture
global contexts, and the coarse granularity of blocks leads to persistent
internal sparsity, resulting in suboptimal accuracy and efficiency. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{AnchorAttention}, a difference-aware,
dynamic sparse attention mechanism that efficiently identifies critical
attention regions at a finer stripe granularity while adapting to global
contextual information, achieving superior speed and accuracy. AnchorAttention
comprises three key components: (1) \textbf{Pattern-based Anchor Computation},
leveraging the commonalities present across all inputs to rapidly compute a set
of near-maximum scores as the anchor; (2) \textbf{Difference-aware Stripe
Sparsity Identification}, performing difference-aware comparisons with the
anchor to quickly obtain discrete coordinates of significant regions in a
stripe-like sparsity pattern; (3) \textbf{Fine-grained Sparse Computation},
replacing the traditional contiguous KV block loading approach with
simultaneous discrete KV position loading to maximize sparsity rates while
preserving full hardware computational potential. With its finer-grained
sparsity strategy, \textbf{AnchorAttention} achieves higher sparsity rates at
the same recall level, significantly reducing computation time. Compared to
previous state-of-the-art methods, at a text length of 128k, it achieves a
speedup of 1.44$\times$ while maintaining higher recall rates.

TL;DR: 论文提出了StragglAR算法，通过解决分布式机器学习中持久性慢节点导致的AllReduce同步延迟问题，显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Motivation: 现有的AllReduce算法在面对持久性慢节点时会导致同步延迟，影响分布式机器学习的效率。

Method: StragglAR算法在慢节点延迟期间执行ReduceScatter操作，随后采用新型集体算法完成AllReduce。

Result: 理论速度提升2倍，8-GPU服务器上实现22%的速度提升。

Conclusion: StragglAR有效解决了持久性慢节点问题，提升了分布式机器学习性能。

Abstract: Distributed machine learning workloads use data and tensor parallelism for
training and inference, both of which rely on the AllReduce collective to
synchronize gradients or activations. However, bulk-synchronous AllReduce
algorithms can be delayed by a persistent straggler that is slower to reach the
synchronization barrier required to begin the collective. To address this
challenge, we propose StragglAR: an AllReduce algorithm that accelerates
distributed training and inference in the presence of persistent stragglers.
StragglAR implements a ReduceScatter among the remaining GPUs during the
straggler-induced delay, and then executes a novel collective algorithm to
complete the AllReduce once the straggler reaches the synchronization barrier.
StragglAR achieves a 2x theoretical speedup over popular bandwidth-efficient
AllReduce algorithms (e.g., Ring) for large GPU clusters with persistent
stragglers. On an 8-GPU server, our implementation of StragglAR yields a 22%
speedup over state-of-the-art AllReduce algorithms.

Motivation: 当前的RL算法依赖复杂模型（如扩散模型或自回归变换器），但这些模型计算成本高或需要离散表示。归一化流（NFs）提供了高效且可扩展的替代方案，但其在RL中的潜力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出一种新型归一化流（NF）架构，无缝集成到RL算法中，用于表示策略、Q函数和占用度量，避免了复杂微分方程或自回归结构的计算负担。

Conclusion: 归一化流在RL中具有强大表达力，其高效性与简洁性为未来RL研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have found success by using
powerful probabilistic models, such as transformers, energy-based models, and
diffusion/flow-based models. To this end, RL researchers often choose to pay
the price of accommodating these models into their algorithms -- diffusion
models are expressive, but are computationally intensive due to their reliance
on solving differential equations, while autoregressive transformer models are
scalable but typically require learning discrete representations. Normalizing
flows (NFs), by contrast, seem to provide an appealing alternative, as they
enable likelihoods and sampling without solving differential equations or
autoregressive architectures. However, their potential in RL has received
limited attention, partly due to the prevailing belief that normalizing flows
lack sufficient expressivity. We show that this is not the case. Building on
recent work in NFs, we propose a single NF architecture which integrates
seamlessly into RL algorithms, serving as a policy, Q-function, and occupancy
measure. Our approach leads to much simpler algorithms, and achieves higher
performance in imitation learning, offline, goal conditioned RL and
unsupervised RL.

Abstract: The present study performs a comprehensive fairness analysis of machine
learning (ML) models for the diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI-derived neuroimaging features. Biases
associated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the
influence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are
investigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in
the identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most
appropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies
is performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the
trade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the
equalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic
applications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to
age and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed
mitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across
the different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and
gender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%,
respectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI
versus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial
debiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic
mean score of 0.69. Insights are provided into how variations in AD
neuropathology and risk factors, associated with demographic characteristics,
influence model fairness.

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine
learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into
low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used
in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we
propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our
approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps
subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input
subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled
distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the
Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the
similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive
learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against
state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of
SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the
generated contrastive pairs.

Conclusion: tnLLM结合领域知识与LLM推理，高效解决了TN-SS问题，兼具性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) provide efficient representations of high-dimensional
data, yet identification of the optimal TN structures, the so called tensor
network structure search (TN-SS) problem, remains a challenge. Current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they
require extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world
applications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information
inherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN
structures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,
which incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict
suitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware
prompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures
based on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our
approach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,
but also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.
Experimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective
function values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA
algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLM-enabled domain information
can be used to find good initializations in the search space for sampling-based
SOTA methods to accelerate their convergence while preserving theoretical
performance guarantees.

fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on distributed devices by reducing the
number of trainable parameters. However, existing approaches often inadequately
overlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data
heterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency,
particularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
federated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the
convergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and
communication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for
federated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without
requiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an
adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client
resources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we
formulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the
LoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock
convergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to
approximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to
state-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了Segment Policy Optimization (SPO)，一种新的强化学习框架，通过中等粒度的分段级优势估计，解决了现有方法在优势估计粒度上的不足，并在两种具体场景中实现了显著性能提升。

Motivation: 为了解决现有强化学习方法在优势估计粒度上的不足（细粒度估计不准确，粗粒度估计不精确），提出了一种中等粒度的分段级优势估计方法，以更好地平衡精确性和效率。

Method: 提出了SPO框架，包括三个核心组件：(1) 灵活的分段划分策略；(2) 精确的分段优势估计；(3) 使用分段优势进行策略优化（含新的概率掩码策略）。并针对短链和长链思维（CoT）场景分别设计了SPO-chain和SPO-tree。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SPO-chain比PPO和GRPO准确率提高6-12个百分点；在MATH500数据集上，SPO-tree在2K和4K上下文评估中比GRPO提高7-11个百分点。

Conclusion: SPO通过分段级优势估计，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力，并且在效率和准确性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively
using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing
approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:
Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage
signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training
an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,
GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,
leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we
propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages
segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a
better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level
methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,
enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a
critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible
segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy
optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask
strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain
for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and
chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point
improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT,
featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces
the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements
over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation. We make our code
publicly available at https://github.com/AIFrameResearch/SPO.

TL;DR: RP-GSSM是一种无监督学习时间序列数据的新方法，结合对比方法的直觉和概率生成模型的灵活性，通过最大似然学习高斯潜在状态空间模型，无需显式网络映射，且能准确推断潜在变量。

Motivation: 为了解决时间序列数据中潜在动态结构的无监督学习问题，结合对比方法和生成模型的优势，提出RP-GSSM模型。

Method: RP-GSSM是一种概率模型，通过最大似然学习高斯潜在状态空间模型，利用非线性神经网络链接观测与潜在变量，无需显式映射。

Result: RP-GSSM在非线性随机动态学习任务中表现优于其他方法，尤其在视频数据（含或不含背景干扰）中表现突出。

Conclusion: RP-GSSM是一个强大的基础模型，适用于多种下游应用。

Abstract: We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with
latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space
model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian
Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at
different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the
flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive
approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum
likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an
explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus
model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and
expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent
prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural
network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the
RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary
losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms
alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics
from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the
RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.

Abstract: Unlocking deep, interpretable biological reasoning from complex genomic data
is a major AI challenge hindering scientific discovery. Current DNA foundation
models, despite strong sequence representation, struggle with multi-step
reasoning and lack inherent transparent, biologically intuitive explanations.
We introduce BioReason, a pioneering architecture that, for the first time,
deeply integrates a DNA foundation model with a Large Language Model (LLM).
This novel connection enables the LLM to directly process and reason with
genomic information as a fundamental input, fostering a new form of multimodal
biological understanding. BioReason's sophisticated multi-step reasoning is
developed through supervised fine-tuning and targeted reinforcement learning,
guiding the system to generate logical, biologically coherent deductions. On
biological reasoning benchmarks including KEGG-based disease pathway prediction
- where accuracy improves from 88% to 97% - and variant effect prediction,
BioReason demonstrates an average 15% performance gain over strong
single-modality baselines. BioReason reasons over unseen biological entities
and articulates decision-making through interpretable, step-by-step biological
traces, offering a transformative approach for AI in biology that enables
deeper mechanistic insights and accelerates testable hypothesis generation from
genomic data. Data, code, and checkpoints are publicly available at

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，PIR显著减少了实例级误差并提升了预测可靠性。

Conclusion: PIR是一种有效的后处理框架，能够提升多种主流预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications
and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods
have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases
and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a
significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts,
missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for
specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address
this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance
forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision.
Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating
their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using
contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from
both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models
demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and
significantly improves forecasting reliability.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法在训练大语言模型时存在稳定性不足和计算效率低的问题，需要一种更简洁高效的方法。

Conclusion: OPO为大型语言模型的对齐和推理任务提供了一种稳定有效的强化学习方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are fundamental to align large language
models with human preferences and to enhance their reasoning capabilities.
However, current reinforcement learning algorithms often suffer from training
instability due to loose on-policy constraints and computational inefficiency
due to auxiliary models. In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal
reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm
designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact
on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and
enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that
theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and
training stability without additional models or regularization terms.
Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy,
encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses. These results highlight
OPO as a promising direction for stable and effective reinforcement learning in
large language model alignment and reasoning tasks. The implementation is

Abstract: This paper explores second-order optimization methods in Federated Learning
(FL), addressing the critical challenges of slow convergence and the excessive
communication rounds required to achieve optimal performance from the global
model. While existing surveys in FL primarily focus on challenges related to
statistical and device label heterogeneity, as well as privacy and security
concerns in first-order FL methods, less attention has been given to the issue
of slow model training. This slow training often leads to the need for
excessive communication rounds or increased communication costs, particularly
when data across clients are highly heterogeneous. In this paper, we examine
various FL methods that leverage second-order optimization to accelerate the
training process. We provide a comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art
second-order FL methods and compare their performance based on convergence
speed, computational cost, memory usage, transmission overhead, and
generalization of the global model. Our findings show the potential of
incorporating Hessian curvature through second-order optimization into FL and
highlight key challenges, such as the efficient utilization of Hessian and its
inverse in FL. This work lays the groundwork for future research aimed at
developing scalable and efficient federated optimization methods for improving
the training of the global model in FL.

Abstract: Post-training of foundation language models has emerged as a promising
research domain in federated learning (FL) with the goal to enable
privacy-preserving model improvements and adaptations to user's downstream
tasks. Recent advances in this area adopt centralized post-training approaches
that build upon black-box foundation language models where there is no access
to model weights and architecture details. Although the use of black-box models
has been successful in centralized post-training, their blind replication in FL
raises several concerns. Our position is that using black-box models in FL
contradicts the core principles of federation such as data privacy and
autonomy. In this position paper, we critically analyze the usage of black-box
models in federated post-training, and provide a detailed account of various
aspects of openness and their implications for FL.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）对模糊化任务的识别与解决能力，发现即使是人类无法理解的文本，模型仍能完成任务，表明存在过度依赖记忆而非推理的现象。

Motivation: 研究动机在于验证LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅依赖训练数据的记忆，尤其是在面对模糊化任务时的表现差异。

Method: 通过对比不同LLMs在竞争性编程和基准任务（如LeetCode和MATH）上的表现，使用噪声和删减等方法模糊化任务文本。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs均能解决高度模糊化的任务，但表现出明显的记忆依赖行为（即‘急切模式匹配’），对新数据表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁谨慎设计实验基准，并提出通过模糊化性能衰减检测数据集污染，提示自动化系统的安全与可解释性风险。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
recognise and solve tasks which have been obfuscated beyond recognition.
Focusing on competitive programming and benchmark tasks (LeetCode and MATH), we
compare performance across multiple models and obfuscation methods, such as
noise and redaction. We demonstrate that all evaluated LLMs can solve tasks
obfuscated to a level where the text would be unintelligible to human readers,
and does not contain key pieces of instruction or context. We introduce the
concept of eager pattern matching to describe this behaviour, which is not
observed in tasks published after the models' knowledge cutoff date, indicating
strong memorisation or overfitting to training data, rather than legitimate
reasoning about the presented problem. We report empirical evidence of distinct
performance decay patterns between contaminated and unseen datasets. We discuss
the implications for benchmarking and evaluations of model behaviour, arguing
for caution when designing experiments using standard datasets. We also propose
measuring the decay of performance under obfuscation as a possible strategy for
detecting dataset contamination and highlighting potential safety risks and
interpretability issues for automated software systems.

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功验证了维度间模型的可迁移性，并为未来设计提供了指导原则。

Abstract: Many modern learning tasks require models that can take inputs of varying
sizes. Consequently, dimension-independent architectures have been proposed for
domains where the inputs are graphs, sets, and point clouds. Recent work on
graph neural networks has explored whether a model trained on low-dimensional
data can transfer its performance to higher-dimensional inputs. We extend this
body of work by introducing a general framework for transferability across
dimensions. We show that transferability corresponds precisely to continuity in
a limit space formed by identifying small problem instances with equivalent
large ones. This identification is driven by the data and the learning task. We
instantiate our framework on existing architectures, and implement the
necessary changes to ensure their transferability. Finally, we provide design
principles for designing new transferable models. Numerical experiments support
our findings.

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities --
such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning --
within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified
models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and
non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to
limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion
transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and
image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch,
Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone
with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal
generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger
autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the
potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual
priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: The transition from traditional power grids to smart grids, significant
increase in the use of renewable energy sources, and soaring electricity prices
has triggered a digital transformation of the energy infrastructure that
enables new, data driven, applications often supported by machine learning
models. However, the majority of the developed machine learning models rely on
univariate data. To date, a structured study considering the role meta-data and
additional measurements resulting in multivariate data is missing. In this
paper we propose a taxonomy that identifies and structures various types of
data related to energy applications. The taxonomy can be used to guide
application specific data model development for training machine learning
models. Focusing on a household electricity forecasting application, we
validate the effectiveness of the proposed taxonomy in guiding the selection of
the features for various types of models. As such, we study of the effect of
domain, contextual and behavioral features on the forecasting accuracy of four
interpretable machine learning techniques and three openly available datasets.
Finally, using a feature importance techniques, we explain individual feature
contributions to the forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究为复杂图结构提供了更强大且高效的不变嵌入方法，扩展了Skew Spectrum的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of permutation-invariant graph embeddings,
generalizing the Skew Spectrum of graphs of Kondor & Borgwardt (2008). Grounded
in group theory and harmonic analysis, our method introduces a new class of
graph invariants that are isomorphism-invariant and capable of embedding richer
graph structures - including attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, and
hypergraphs - which the Skew Spectrum could not handle. Our generalization
further defines a family of functions that enables a trade-off between
computational complexity and expressivity. By applying
generalization-preserving heuristics to this family, we improve the Skew
Spectrum's expressivity at the same computational cost. We formally prove the
invariance of our generalization, demonstrate its improved expressiveness
through experiments, and discuss its efficient computation.

in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time
objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general
framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the
generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed
Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using
breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range

Conclusion: DLNs是回归任务中透明且高效的可行替代方案，尤其适用于需要模型透明度和计算效率的场景。

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) achieve outstanding performance in many domains;
however, their decision processes are often opaque and their inference can be
computationally expensive in resource-constrained environments. We recently
proposed Differentiable Logic Networks (DLNs) to address these issues for
tabular classification based on relaxing discrete logic into a differentiable
form, thereby enabling gradient-based learning of networks built from binary
logic operations. DLNs offer interpretable reasoning and substantially lower
inference cost.
  We extend the DLN framework to supervised tabular regression. Specifically,
we redesign the final output layer to support continuous targets and unify the
original two-phase training procedure into a single differentiable stage. We
evaluate the resulting model on 15 public regression benchmarks, comparing it
with modern neural networks and classical regression baselines. Regression DLNs
match or exceed baseline accuracy while preserving interpretability and fast
inference. Our results show that DLNs are a viable, cost-effective alternative
for regression tasks, especially where model transparency and computational
efficiency are important.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合目标阅读文本的端到端架构，通过提示改进逐字转录和直接错误检测，从而提高朗读错误标注的性能。

Motivation: 现有方法（如ASR转录后比较）在转录不准确时表现不佳，需改进朗读错误标注方法。

Method: 提出端到端架构，结合目标文本提示，同时优化逐字转录和错误检测。

Result: 在儿童朗读和成人非典型语音案例中，该方法在转录和错误检测上优于当前最优技术。

Conclusion: 通过结合目标文本提示的端到端训练，可显著提升朗读错误检测性能。

Abstract: Identifying mistakes (i.e., miscues) made while reading aloud is commonly
approached post-hoc by comparing automatic speech recognition (ASR)
transcriptions to the target reading text. However, post-hoc methods perform
poorly when ASR inaccurately transcribes verbatim speech. To improve on current
methods for reading error annotation, we propose a novel end-to-end
architecture that incorporates the target reading text via prompting and is
trained for both improved verbatim transcription and direct miscue detection.
Our contributions include: first, demonstrating that incorporating reading text
through prompting benefits verbatim transcription performance over fine-tuning,
and second, showing that it is feasible to augment speech recognition tasks for
end-to-end miscue detection. We conducted two case studies -- children's
read-aloud and adult atypical speech -- and found that our proposed strategies
improve verbatim transcription and miscue detection compared to current
state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了MCP协议存在更广泛的威胁模型，即只需在线发布恶意内容即可欺骗MCP代理执行攻击，并提出通过DPO和RAG-Pref方法提升LLM对FBA攻击的防御能力。

Motivation: MCP协议作为开放标准虽广泛用于生成式AI代理集成，但近期研究发现其易受FBA攻击。传统攻击需用户直接下载恶意文件，而本文发现攻击者仅需在线发布内容即可欺骗代理，威胁范围远超预期。

Method: 通过构建新的MCP数据集（包含FBA和良性样本），采用DPO训练LLM的拒绝能力，并提出RAG-Pref方法（结合检索增强生成与偏好对齐）进一步优化模型防御表现。

Result: DPO能提升模型防御能力，但效果受初始对齐方案影响（如GRPO模型表现极差）。RAG-Pref显著增强了LLM拒绝FBA的能力，尤其与DPO结合时效果更佳。

Conclusion: RAG-Pref与DPO的结合显著强化了针对MCP攻击的防护机制，为生成式AI代理的安全性提供了新方向。

Abstract: The model context protocol (MCP) has been widely adapted as an open standard
enabling the seamless integration of generative AI agents. However, recent work
has shown the MCP is susceptible to retrieval-based "falsely benign" attacks
(FBAs), allowing malicious system access and credential theft, but requiring
that users download compromised files directly to their systems. Herein, we
show that the threat model of MCP-based attacks is significantly broader than
previously thought, i.e., attackers need only post malicious content online to
deceive MCP agents into carrying out their attacks on unsuspecting victims'
systems.
  To improve alignment guardrails against such attacks, we introduce a new MCP
dataset of FBAs and (truly) benign samples to explore the effectiveness of
direct preference optimization (DPO) for the refusal training of large language
models (LLMs). While DPO improves model guardrails against such attacks, we
show that the efficacy of refusal learning varies drastically depending on the
model's original post-training alignment scheme--e.g., GRPO-based LLMs learn to
refuse extremely poorly. Thus, to further improve FBA refusals, we introduce
Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference alignment (RAG-Pref), a novel
preference alignment strategy based on RAG. We show that RAG-Pref significantly
improves the ability of LLMs to refuse FBAs, particularly when combined with
DPO alignment, thus drastically improving guardrails against MCP-based attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) for neural architecture search (NAS) improves acquisition optimization via explicit graph space formulations, proven effective in NAS benchmarks.

Motivation: Existing graph BO works focus on surrogate models but neglect discrete optimization over graph structures. This paper addresses the complexity of graph search space and acquisition functions.

Method: Proposes explicit optimization formulations for graph input space (e.g., reachability, shortest paths) to derive graph kernels and acquisition functions, with theoretical proof of equivalence to graph space.

Result: Numerical results show the method efficiently finds optimal architectures in most NAS benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses challenges in graph BO and demonstrates strong performance in NAS.

Abstract: Graph Bayesian optimization (BO) has shown potential as a powerful and
data-efficient tool for neural architecture search (NAS). Most existing graph
BO works focus on developing graph surrogates models, i.e., metrics of networks
and/or different kernels to quantify the similarity between networks. However,
the acquisition optimization, as a discrete optimization task over graph
structures, is not well studied due to the complexity of formulating the graph
search space and acquisition functions. This paper presents explicit
optimization formulations for graph input space including properties such as
reachability and shortest paths, which are used later to formulate graph
kernels and the acquisition function. We theoretically prove that the proposed
encoding is an equivalent representation of the graph space and provide
restrictions for the NAS domain with either node or edge labels. Numerical
results over several NAS benchmarks show that our method efficiently finds the
optimal architecture for most cases, highlighting its efficacy.

Conclusion: 研究为DPO目标、偏好数据结构和策略行为提供了统一的理论视角，强调了微分信息在偏好优化中的关键作用。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用连续值标记（CoT2）进行链式思维推理的方法，通过逻辑任务验证其表达能力和效率优势，并展现了监督和采样策略的优化效果。

Motivation: 研究动机是探索连续值标记在链式思维推理中的潜力，相较于离散采样，它能提供更丰富的表达和并行推理能力。

Method: 方法包括理论分析CoT2的并行推理优势，提出匹配软输出与目标分布的新监督策略，以及两种采样策略（K标记采样和连续探索）用于优化和自改进。

Result: 结果显示，CoT2在组合问题（如子集和问题）中表现出高效性，且优化后的模型性能超过初始离散或连续监督。

Conclusion: 结论是CoT2为链式思维推理提供了更优的框架，其监督和采样策略有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current language models generate chain-of-thought traces by autoregressively
sampling tokens from a finite vocabulary. While this discrete sampling has
achieved remarkable success, conducting chain-of-thought with
continuously-valued tokens (CoT2) offers a richer and more expressive
alternative. Our work examines the benefits of CoT2 through logical reasoning
tasks that inherently require search capabilities and provide optimization and
exploration methods for CoT2. Theoretically, we show that CoT2 allows the model
to track multiple traces in parallel and quantify its benefits for inference
efficiency. Notably, one layer transformer equipped with CoT2 can provably
solve the combinatorial "subset sum problem" given sufficient embedding
dimension. These insights lead to a novel and effective supervision strategy
where we match the softmax outputs to the empirical token distributions of a
set of target traces. Complementing this, we introduce sampling strategies that
unlock policy optimization and self-improvement for CoT2. Our first strategy
samples and composes $K$ discrete tokens at each decoding step to control the
level of parallelism, and reduces to standard CoT when $K=1$. Our second
strategy relies on continuous exploration over the probability simplex.
Experiments confirm that policy optimization with CoT2 indeed improves the
performance of the model beyond its initial discrete or continuous supervision.

Result: 实验证明HDRQ在量化时最小化对预训练模型的偏离，同时平滑损失表面，有效促进模型合并。

Conclusion: HDRQ为量化模型在多目标域适应中的合并提供了首个解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful technique for combining task-specific
weights, achieving superior performance in multi-target domain adaptation.
However, when applied to practical scenarios, such as quantized models, new
challenges arise. In practical scenarios, quantization is often applied to
target-specific data, but this process restricts the domain of interest and
introduces discretization effects, making model merging highly non-trivial. In
this study, we analyze the impact of quantization on model merging through the
lens of error barriers. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel
post-training quantization, HDRQ - Hessian and distant regularizing
quantization - that is designed to consider model merging for multi-target
domain adaptation. Our approach ensures that the quantization process incurs
minimal deviation from the source pre-trained model while flattening the loss
surface to facilitate smooth model merging. To our knowledge, this is the first
study on this challenge, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness.

Motivation: 探究LLMs隐式多跳推理的底层机制，以提高模型的可解释性和透明度。

Method: 通过在受控符号环境中从头训练Transformer，分析学习轨迹，并提出跨查询语义修补和余弦基表示工具。

Result: 发现隐式推理的三个阶段：早期记忆、分布内泛化和跨分布泛化；原子三元组训练加速学习，特定组合结构的查询级暴露是关键。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs的隐式多跳推理提供了新见解，链接了表示结构与推理能力，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop
reasoning implicitly -- producing correct answers without explicitly
verbalizing intermediate steps -- but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly
understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by
training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our
analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization,
followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution
generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but
accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level
exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we
introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies
semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based
representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with
the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn
provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across
training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These
findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop
reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold
internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models.

Conclusion: AMBER能够泛化到未见过的几何形状，并在自适应网格生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh.
Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in
critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome
manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert
Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation.
Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e.,
a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target
mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an
out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical
graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically
projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate
AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical
components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER
generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent
baselines, including ones using Graph and Convolutional Neural Networks, and
Reinforcement Learning-based approaches.

Motivation: 在贝叶斯优化中，人类反馈成本高且信息有限（仅偏好对比），现有方法性能界限不够紧。本文旨在提升理论保证，证明在偏好反馈下仍可高效学习最优行动。

Method: 采用与现有工作相同的框架（BTL模型），通过分析信息增益与查询次数的关系，推导出新的遗憾界限$	ilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma(T)T})$。

Conclusion: 偏好反馈虽信息有限，但在理论保证下与标量反馈同样高效，为实际应用（如高成本人类反馈场景）提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) with preference-based feedback has recently
garnered significant attention due to its emerging applications. We refer to
this problem as Bayesian Optimization from Human Feedback (BOHF), which differs
from conventional BO by learning the best actions from a reduced feedback
model, where only the preference between two actions is revealed to the learner
at each time step. The objective is to identify the best action using a limited
number of preference queries, typically obtained through costly human feedback.
Existing work, which adopts the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) feedback model,
provides regret bounds for the performance of several algorithms. In this work,
within the same framework we develop tighter performance guarantees.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\Gamma(T)T})$, where $\Gamma(T)$ represents the
maximum information gain$\unicode{x2014}$a kernel-specific complexity
term$\unicode{x2014}$and $T$ is the number of queries. Our results
significantly improve upon existing bounds. Notably, for common kernels, we
show that the order-optimal sample complexities of conventional
BO$\unicode{x2014}$achieved with richer feedback models$\unicode{x2014}$are
recovered. In other words, the same number of preferential samples as
scalar-valued samples is sufficient to find a nearly optimal solution.

Abstract: Neural network minima are often connected by curves along which train and
test loss remain nearly constant, a phenomenon known as mode connectivity.
While this property has enabled applications such as model merging and
fine-tuning, its theoretical explanation remains unclear. We propose a new
approach to exploring the connectedness of minima using parameter space
symmetry. By linking the topology of symmetry groups to that of the minima, we
derive the number of connected components of the minima of linear networks and
show that skip connections reduce this number. We then examine when mode
connectivity and linear mode connectivity hold or fail, using parameter
symmetries which account for a significant part of the minimum. Finally, we
provide explicit expressions for connecting curves in the minima induced by
symmetry. Using the curvature of these curves, we derive conditions under which
linear mode connectivity approximately holds. Our findings highlight the role
of continuous symmetries in understanding the neural network loss landscape.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities
across a range of complex reasoning tasks. Prior theoretical work exploring the
expressive power of transformers has shown that they can efficiently perform
multi-step reasoning tasks involving parallelizable computations. However, the
learnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data
distribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization,
remains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we
study the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires
computing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden
permutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\log k)$ layers. On
the negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that
any SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for
the $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in
$k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we
show that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and
sample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\log
k)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in
which data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \le k$
presented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is
presented simultaneously. Our work sheds light on the necessity and sufficiency
of having both easy and hard examples in the data distribution for transformers
to learn complex compositional tasks.

Conclusion: Oracle Border Basis算法证明了深度学习可无缝增强传统符号计算，为可靠高效的代数求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Solving systems of polynomial equations, particularly those with finitely
many solutions, is a crucial challenge across many scientific fields.
Traditional methods like Gr\"obner and Border bases are fundamental but suffer
from high computational costs, which have motivated recent Deep Learning
approaches to improve efficiency, albeit at the expense of output correctness.
In this work, we introduce the Oracle Border Basis Algorithm, the first Deep
Learning approach that accelerates Border basis computation while maintaining
output guarantees. To this end, we design and train a Transformer-based oracle
that identifies and eliminates computationally expensive reduction steps, which
we find to dominate the algorithm's runtime. By selectively invoking this
oracle during critical phases of computation, we achieve substantial speedup
factors of up to 3.5x compared to the base algorithm, without compromising the
correctness of results. To generate the training data, we develop a sampling
method and provide the first sampling theorem for border bases. We construct a
tokenization and embedding scheme tailored to monomial-centered algebraic
computations, resulting in a compact and expressive input representation, which
reduces the number of tokens to encode an $n$-variate polynomial by a factor of
$O(n)$. Our learning approach is data efficient, stable, and a practical
enhancement to traditional computer algebra algorithms and symbolic
computation.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法需要持续访问模型、计算密集且无法灵活适应用户定义的新约束，DiCoFlex旨在解决这些局限性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations play a pivotal role in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) by offering intuitive, human-understandable alternatives
that elucidate machine learning model decisions. Despite their significance,
existing methods for generating counterfactuals often require constant access
to the predictive model, involve computationally intensive optimization for
each instance and lack the flexibility to adapt to new user-defined constraints
without retraining. In this paper, we propose DiCoFlex, a novel model-agnostic,
conditional generative framework that produces multiple diverse counterfactuals
in a single forward pass. Leveraging conditional normalizing flows trained
solely on labeled data, DiCoFlex addresses key limitations by enabling
real-time user-driven customization of constraints such as sparsity and
actionability at inference time. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity,
diversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and
scalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making
domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为(U)NFV的模块化神经网络架构，用于解决双曲守恒定律，相比传统有限体积方法具有更高精度和灵活性。

Motivation: 双曲偏微分方程（特别是守恒定律）的求解具有挑战性，传统有限体积方法虽然数学性质良好，但在复杂场景下精度和灵活性不足。

Method: 通过扩展时空模板学习更新规则，同时保持守恒结构，支持基于解数据的监督训练（NFV）和弱形式残差损失的无监督训练（UNFV）。

Result: (U)NFV在一阶守恒定律上的误差比Godunov方法低10倍，优于ENO/WENO，与间断Galerkin求解器相当但复杂度更低；在交通建模问题上表现优于传统FV方法。

Conclusion: (U)NFV在双曲守恒定律求解中展现出高保真度和可扩展性，为复杂场景提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce (U)NFV, a modular neural network architecture that generalizes
classical finite volume (FV) methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws.
Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) are challenging to solve,
particularly conservation laws whose physically relevant solutions contain
shocks and discontinuities. FV methods are widely used for their mathematical
properties: convergence to entropy solutions, flow conservation, or total
variation diminishing, but often lack accuracy and flexibility in complex
settings. Neural Finite Volume addresses these limitations by learning update
rules over extended spatial and temporal stencils while preserving conservation
structure. It supports both supervised training on solution data (NFV) and
unsupervised training via weak-form residual loss (UNFV). Applied to
first-order conservation laws, (U)NFV achieves up to 10x lower error than
Godunov's method, outperforms ENO/WENO, and rivals discontinuous Galerkin
solvers with far less complexity. On traffic modeling problems, both from PDEs
and from experimental highway data, (U)NFV captures nonlinear wave dynamics
with significantly higher fidelity and scalability than traditional FV
approaches.

TL;DR: The paper explores how integrating continuous control modules in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models affects semantic knowledge transfer and training dynamics, finding that naive implementations hinder performance and proposing a solution to mitigate this issue.

Motivation: To address the conflict between powerful vision-language models (VLMs) with large parameter counts and the need for real-time continuous control in robotics, this paper investigates whether specialized control modules degrade the VLM's semantic knowledge and training efficiency.

Method: The study evaluates VLAs incorporating continuous diffusion or flow matching action experts, analyzing design choices and their impacts. It introduces a technique to insulate the VLM backbone during training to preserve knowledge transfer.

Result: Naively adding continuous control experts harms training speed and knowledge transfer, but the proposed insulation technique mitigates these negative effects.

Conclusion: Preserving semantic knowledge in VLAs requires careful design of control modules, and the proposed insulation approach effectively maintains performance while enabling real-time control.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training
control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end
learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language
model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often
at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds
of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and
operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are
required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models
have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action
experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new
untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules
improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether
they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained
VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we
study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion
or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts
significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an
extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and
knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone
during VLA training that mitigates this issue. Videos are available at

TL;DR: TiRex利用xLSTM提升时间序列零样本预测能力，优于现有大型模型。

Motivation: 填补LSTM缺乏上下文学习能力的空白，提升零样本时间序列预测性能。

Method: 结合xLSTM和改进的训练掩码策略CPM，保持状态跟踪能力。

Result: 在HuggingFace基准测试中超越多个大型模型，包括Google和Salesforce的模型。

Conclusion: TiRex在零样本时间序列预测中表现优越，尤其适合数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks
using only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time
series forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past
values serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful
forecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when
training data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely
on transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often
fall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models
like LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited
for time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack
strong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap
by leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning
skills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as
RWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon
forecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a
training-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in
zero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and
Chronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS
(Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce)
across both short- and long-term forecasts.

TL;DR: 该论文针对多智能体环境下的上下文多臂赌博问题，提出了一种名为COBRA的算法，旨在无需货币激励的情况下抑制智能体的策略性行为，同时保证激励兼容性和次线性遗憾。

Motivation: 现实应用中智能体可能不诚实报告其行为（如在线平台中卖家虚报产品质量），现有研究假设智能体诚实报告的局限性促使作者提出新算法。

Method: 提出COBRA算法，通过设计机制在不使用货币激励的情况下，抑制智能体的策略性行为，确保激励兼容性。

Result: 实验验证了COBRA算法在抑制策略性行为和实现次线性遗憾方面的有效性。

Conclusion: COBRA算法为解决多智能体上下文赌博问题中的策略性行为提供了可行方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: DiffER是一种基于分类扩散的无模板化学逆合成预测方法，通过集成扩散模型和长度预测组件，在多项指标上达到先进水平。

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的模型在化学逆合成中表现良好，但其自回归性质限制了性能，因此需要更高效的替代方法。

Method: 提出DiffER，一种基于分类扩散的无模板方法，集成扩散模型并结合创新的长度预测组件，以同步预测SMILES序列。

Result: DiffER在top-1准确率上达到最优，在top-3、top-5和top-10上也表现出竞争力，并能学习多种实验室合成技术。

Conclusion: DiffER作为无模板模型的新基准，证明了SMILES序列长度预测对提升性能的关键作用，并展示了后验采样能力。

Abstract: Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success
through the application of models traditionally built for natural language
processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have
demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of
chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their
autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method
for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which
allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We
construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art
performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5,
and top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a
strong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a
variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a
variety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By
constructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length
prediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample
from the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong
metrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate
that accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further
boosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.

TL;DR: SC-LoRA 是一种新型的 LoRA 初始化框架，通过约束可训练适配器的输出在低秩子空间中，平衡了高效微调与知识保留的权衡。

Motivation: 传统 LoRA 方法存在收敛速度慢和知识遗忘问题，现有改进方法无法同时解决高效微调和知识保留，SC-LoRA 旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过约束 LoRA 适配器输出在特定低秩子空间，优化微调数据的主要特征而不损害保留的知识特征。

Result: 实验表明，SC-LoRA 在微调性能上优于现有 LoRA 初始化方法，同时显著减少知识遗忘。

Conclusion: SC-LoRA 高效平衡了微调性能和知识保留，为大型语言模型的定制化提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, particularly Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), are indispensable for efficiently customizing Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and
knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of
designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to
preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can
address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce
Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework
engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and
knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable
LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of
fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved
knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the
trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data
while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide
theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including
safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream
tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning
performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing
contemporary LoRA initialization methods.

TL;DR: 论文摘要提到DiLoCo是一种在网络约束下训练大语言模型（LLM）的强大框架，但仍有通信效率问题。研究探讨了通过压缩方法（如Top-k稀疏化和量化）减少DiLoCo通信开销，结合Muon优化器显著提升性能。

Motivation: DiLoCo在大语言模型训练中表现出色，但其通信步骤仍存在效率问题，且现有方法对误差反馈累加器和优化器对压缩性的影响研究不足。

Method: 研究采用标准压缩方法（Top-k稀疏化和量化）结合两种本地优化器（AdamW和Muon），并通过误差反馈累加器评估通信压缩效果。

Result: 实验显示，Muon优化器结合误差反馈累加器可将通信数据压缩至2位，性能几乎无损，且MuLoCo（Muon优化器版的DiLoCo）在通信量减少8倍的同时显著优于原版，内存复杂度相同。

Conclusion: DiLoCo结合Muon优化器和压缩技术可显著提升效率，为网络受限环境下的大模型训练提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: DiLoCo is a powerful framework for training large language models (LLMs)
under networking constraints with advantages for increasing parallelism and
accelerator utilization in data center settings. Despite significantly reducing
communication frequency, however, DiLoCo's communication steps still involve
all-reducing a complete copy of the model's parameters. While existing works
have explored ways to reduce communication in DiLoCo, the role of error
feedback accumulators and the effect of the inner-optimizer on compressibility
remain under-explored. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
standard compression methods including Top-k sparsification and quantization
for reducing the communication overhead of DiLoCo when paired with two local
optimizers (AdamW and Muon). Our experiments pre-training decoder-only
transformer language models (LMs) reveal that leveraging Muon as the inner
optimizer for DiLoCo along with an error-feedback accumulator allows to
aggressively compress the communicated delta to 2-bits with next to no
performance degradation. Crucially, MuLoCo (Muon inner optimizer DiLoCo)
significantly outperforms DiLoCo while communicating 8X less and having
identical memory complexity.

TL;DR: 当前基于情感的CLAP方法通过简单对齐音频与文本提示学习，忽略了情感的序数性。EmotionRankCLAP利用情感维度属性改进跨模态对齐，捕获细粒度情感变化。

Motivation: 现有方法无法捕捉情感的序数性，导致模态间差距大。

Method: 提出EmotionRankCLAP，结合监督对比学习和Rank-N-Contrast目标，利用情感维度属性改进对齐。

Result: 在跨模态检索任务中，EmotionRankCLAP优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EmotionRankCLAP能有效建模情感序数性并提升跨模态对齐。

Abstract: Current emotion-based contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) methods
typically learn by na\"ively aligning audio samples with corresponding text
prompts. Consequently, this approach fails to capture the ordinal nature of
emotions, hindering inter-emotion understanding and often resulting in a wide
modality gap between the audio and text embeddings due to insufficient
alignment. To handle these drawbacks, we introduce EmotionRankCLAP, a
supervised contrastive learning approach that uses dimensional attributes of
emotional speech and natural language prompts to jointly capture fine-grained
emotion variations and improve cross-modal alignment. Our approach utilizes a
Rank-N-Contrast objective to learn ordered relationships by contrasting samples
based on their rankings in the valence-arousal space. EmotionRankCLAP
outperforms existing emotion-CLAP methods in modeling emotion ordinality across
modalities, measured via a cross-modal retrieval task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对齐方法，通过社会选择理论和个体Bradley-Terry模型评估用户多样性偏好，对比现有方法（如RLHF和DPO）在效用损失上的表现。

Motivation: 当前对齐方法假设单一偏好模型，但实际用户偏好多样，导致模型无法满足用户平均需求，亟需一种能适应多元偏好的对齐方法。

Method: 引入社会选择理论和个体Bradley-Terry模型，定义对齐方法的“失真”概念，用于评估不同方法在多元偏好下的效用损失。

Result: Nash Learning from Human Feedback在多数情况下表现最优，失真率为$(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$，而RLHF和DPO在某些情况下失真率显著更高。

Conclusion: 新的对齐方法在多元偏好场景下表现更优，为对齐技术的发展提供了理论和实践依据。

Abstract: After pre-training, large language models are aligned with human preferences
based on pairwise comparisons. State-of-the-art alignment methods (such as
PPO-based RLHF and DPO) are built on the assumption of aligning with a single
preference model, despite being deployed in settings where users have diverse
preferences. As a result, it is not even clear that these alignment methods
produce models that satisfy users on average -- a minimal requirement for
pluralistic alignment. Drawing on social choice theory and modeling users'
comparisons through individual Bradley-Terry (BT) models, we introduce an
alignment method's distortion: the worst-case ratio between the optimal
achievable average utility, and the average utility of the learned policy.
  The notion of distortion helps draw sharp distinctions between alignment
methods: Nash Learning from Human Feedback achieves the minimax optimal
distortion of $(\frac{1}{2} + o(1)) \cdot \beta$ (for the BT temperature
$\beta$), robustly across utility distributions, distributions of comparison
pairs, and permissible KL divergences from the reference policy. RLHF and DPO,
by contrast, suffer $\geq (1 - o(1)) \cdot \beta$ distortion already without a
KL constraint, and $e^{\Omega(\beta)}$ or even unbounded distortion in the full
setting, depending on how comparison pairs are sampled.

Motivation: 当前序列模型在处理图像时通常采用固定的行优先顺序，而不同的补丁顺序可能显著影响性能。作者旨在探索任务最优的补丁排序方法。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先基于信息论评估补丁序列的可压缩性；然后通过REINFORCE优化Plackett-Luce策略，学习补丁排列策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，REOrder比行优先排序的Top-1准确率提高3.01%，在Functional Map of the World上提升13.35%。

Conclusion: 通过优化补丁顺序，REOrder显著提升了模型性能，展示了补丁顺序在视觉任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.

Abstract: Model immunization aims to pre-train models that are difficult to fine-tune
on harmful tasks while retaining their utility on other non-harmful tasks.
Though prior work has shown empirical evidence for immunizing text-to-image
models, the key understanding of when immunization is possible and a precise
definition of an immunized model remain unclear. In this work, we propose a
framework, based on the condition number of a Hessian matrix, to analyze model
immunization for linear models. Building on this framework, we design an
algorithm with regularization terms to control the resulting condition numbers
after pre-training. Empirical results on linear models and non-linear deep-nets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on model immunization.

Motivation: 分析公共交通服务质量需要处理大量数据和复杂SQL查询，这对大多数用户较为困难，因此需要一个用户友好的交互工具。

Method: 采用代理架构扩展大型语言模型（LLM）能力，集成SQL查询、数据可视化和地图生成工具，并通过工作流收集性能评估数据。

Result: 聊天机器人经过广泛测试，生成了用于评估其回答一致性和查询正确性的数据集。

Conclusion: 该聊天机器人有效简化了公共交通数据分析，同时解决了生成式AI项目性能评估数据收集的难点。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of public transportation services requires the analysis
of large quantities of data on the scheduled and actual trips and documents
listing the quality constraints each service needs to meet. Interrogating such
datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite
complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly
tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based
on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large
Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can
execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating
maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one
of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to
measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with
a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the
retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such
questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with
actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the
evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its
answers and the correctness of the generated queries.

Abstract: We explore the use of Artificial Potential Fields (APFs) to solve Multi-Agent
Path Finding (MAPF) and Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problems. In MAPF, a team of
agents must move to their goal locations without collisions, whereas in LMAPF,
new goals are generated upon arrival. We propose methods for incorporating APFs
in a range of MAPF algorithms, including Prioritized Planning, MAPF-LNS2, and
Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT). Experimental results show that
using APF is not beneficial for MAPF but yields up to a 7-fold increase in
overall system throughput for LMAPF.

TL;DR: 论文通过将数学问题解决分解为计划、执行和验证三个基本能力，分析了强化学习（RL）方法（如GRPO）在提升大语言模型（LLM）推理能力中的作用。研究发现RL主要提升执行能力，但对新问题因计划能力不足而遇到“覆盖墙”。作者通过合成任务验证了RL的局限性，并探讨了克服这一障碍的可能路径。

Motivation: 现有评估方法（如准确率）无法精细分析LLM的推理能力，尤其是强化学习（RL）方法（如GRPO）在数学问题解决中的具体作用。作者希望揭示RL如何影响LLM的问题解决能力，并识别其局限性。

Method: 将问题解决分解为计划（Plan）、执行（Execute）、验证（Verify）三个子能力，通过实验分析GRPO对每项能力的影响。此外，设计了一个合成的解决方案树导航任务，以模拟数学问题解决，验证RL的作用。

Result: RL（如GRPO）主要提升执行能力（温度蒸馏现象），但对新问题因计划能力不足而遇到“覆盖墙”。合成任务验证了RL的局限性，同时也发现通过改进探索和泛化能力可能克服这一障碍。

Conclusion: 研究表明RL能有效提升LLM的执行能力，但计划能力仍是瓶颈。未来需探索如何通过改进探索和泛化来突破“覆盖墙”。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy
metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail
to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better
understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into
fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps),
Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the
correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the
execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already
knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More
importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new
problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To
explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic
solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving.
This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL
primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we
identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall
through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our
findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning,
expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且隐私友好，为长期抑郁监测提供可行方案。

Abstract: Mental disorders including depression, anxiety, and other neurological
disorders pose a significant global challenge, particularly among individuals
exhibiting social avoidance tendencies. This study proposes a hybrid approach
by leveraging smartphone sensor data measuring daily physical activities and
analyzing their social media (Twitter) interactions for evaluating an
individual's depression level. Using CNN-based deep learning models and Naive
Bayes classification, we identify human physical activities accurately and also
classify the user sentiments. A total of 33 participants were recruited for
data acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical
activities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using
the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six
are derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition
accuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter
activities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several
physical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity
of depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support
vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high
accuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer
perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly
effective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal
privacy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，用于将多个因果流程变体统一为一个一致的模型，保留原始因果模型的正确性，并明确表示它们的因果流交替。

Motivation: 现有方法无法捕捉多个变体中的交替因果条件，导致在处理缺失值和表达不同活动轨迹间的交替条件时面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种将多个因果流程变体统一为一致模型的新方法，该方法正式定义并证明了其正确性。

Result: 方法在三个公开数据集和两个专有数据集上进行了评估，并作为开源实现发布。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效统一因果流程变体，并明确表示其交替条件，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Causal reasoning is essential for business process interventions and
improvement, requiring a clear understanding of causal relationships among
activity execution times in an event log. Recent work introduced a method for
discovering causal process models but lacked the ability to capture alternating
causal conditions across multiple variants. This raises the challenges of
handling missing values and expressing the alternating conditions among log
splits when blending traces with varying activities.
  We propose a novel method to unify multiple causal process variants into a
consistent model that preserves the correctness of the original causal models,
while explicitly representing their causal-flow alternations. The method is
formally defined, proved, evaluated on three open and two proprietary datasets,
and released as an open-source implementation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于定量推理的方法来改进医学系统综述中的数值证据提取与结论推断，相比传统文本推理方法，其方法在性能上有显著提升。

Motivation: 医学系统综述的自动化过程中，数值证据提取和结论推断是关键瓶颈。传统方法依赖浅层文本线索，未能捕捉到专家评估背后的数值推理逻辑。

Method: 论文将问题重新定义为定量推理任务，开发了一个包含数值数据提取模型和效应估计组件的系统，并采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）训练模型。

Result: 在CochraneForest基准测试中，最佳方法（使用RL训练的小规模数值提取模型）F1分数比检索系统提升21%，比400B参数的大模型提升9%。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于推理的方法在自动化系统证据合成中的潜力。

Abstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based
decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central
bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and
determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons.
Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving
relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such
approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the
underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.
  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning.
Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured
numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain
knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a
numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an
effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference
aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction
model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.
  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach
-- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a
21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and
outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our
results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating
systematic evidence synthesis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FMG的新方法，利用多模态基础模型（MMFMs）学习可解释的分子语言，替代传统的基于专家注释或启发式方法的分子生成和性质预测。

Motivation: 现有的分子生成方法依赖专家注释或不可靠的启发式算法，限制了生成模型的可解释性和效率。

Method: FMG通过多模态基础模型（MMFMs）将分子表示为图像和文本，并利用提示学习跨模态对齐信息，从而实现可解释的分子语言。

Result: FMG在可合成性、多样性和数据效率方面表现出色，并为分子发现工作流提供了内置的化学可解释性。

Conclusion: FMG是一种高效、可解释的分子生成和性质预测方法。

Abstract: Recent data-efficient molecular generation approaches exploit graph grammars
to introduce interpretability into the generative models. However, grammar
learning therein relies on expert annotation or unreliable heuristics for
algorithmic inference. We propose Foundation Molecular Grammar (FMG), which
leverages multi-modal foundation models (MMFMs) to induce an interpretable
molecular language. By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG
renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information
across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in
replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation
and property prediction. We show that FMG not only excels in synthesizability,
diversity, and data efficiency but also offers built-in chemical
interpretability for automated molecular discovery workflows. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于达尔文进化的自改进AI系统（DGM），通过迭代修改自身代码并在编码基准上验证改进，显著提升了编码能力。

Motivation: 当前AI系统架构固定且无法自主改进，自动化AI进步可能加速发展并带来更大收益。但现有人工设计的元学习方法受限于搜索空间和一级改进，而Gödel机器的理论自改进在实际中难以证明其多数改进是有益的。

Method: 提出Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM)，通过达尔文进化和开放式探索，维护一个编码代理档案库，利用基础模型生成新的、有趣的代理版本，并行探索多样化的改进路径，并通过基准测试验证改进。

Result: DGM在SWE-bench上从20.0%提升到50.0%，在Polyglot上从14.2%提升到30.7%，显著优于缺乏自改进或开放式探索的基线系统。

Conclusion: DGM是迈向自改进AI的重要一步，能够通过开放式探索持续创新，显著提升编码能力，同时在实验过程中采取了安全措施。

Abstract: Today's AI systems have human-designed, fixed architectures and cannot
autonomously and continuously improve themselves. The advance of AI could
itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and
allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the
discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and
the human design of a suitable search space. The G\"odel machine proposed a
theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in
a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net
beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\"odel Machine
(DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby
also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically
validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution
and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding
agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a
foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent.
This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality
agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the
search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding
capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management,
peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to
50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly
outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All
experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human
oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of
gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless
innovation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了多智能体辩论（MAD）框架在增强语言模型问题解决能力中的作用，发现其在数学推理和安全任务中表现不同，并揭示了任务难度、模型规模和智能体多样性对MAD效果的影响。

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型能力的显著提升，多智能体系统成为增强问题解决能力的新方向。然而，对于多智能体辩论（MAD）相比于单智能体方法的有效性，尤其是不同条件下的表现，缺乏系统性研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将MAD概念化为一种测试时计算扩展技术，并进行全面的实证研究，比较MAD与单智能体扩展基线在数学推理和安全相关任务上的表现，系统评估任务难度、模型规模和智能体多样性的影响。

Result: 数学推理中，MAD在问题难度增加和模型能力降低时更有效，但智能体多样性影响不大；而在安全任务中，MAD的协作细化可能增加漏洞，但引入多样化智能体配置可通过协作逐步减少攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来开发更有效且战略部署的MAD系统提供了关键指导。

Abstract: The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred
exploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a
promising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD)
approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine
arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse
perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a
systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,
particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to
fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling
technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration
capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD
with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning
and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of
task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key
findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages
over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem
difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little
benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can
increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations
facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative
refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the
future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文总结了20世纪关于直觉与反思思维的理性战争，结合21世纪的双过程理论，提出了"战略反思主义"，强调智能系统应实用主义地切换直觉与反思思维以实现目标。

Motivation: 探讨直觉与反思思维的演变及其在人工智能中的应用，结合历史与最新实验成果。

Method: 综合历史观点和现代实验，提出战略反思主义理论。

Result: 战略反思主义强调实用主义切换直觉与反思思维，超越模型大小等表面指标。

Conclusion: 智能系统的关键在于灵活切换直觉与反思思维，这一理论随研究深入更具操作性。

Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the
nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from
mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more
idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st
century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories
to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this
history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from
experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which
takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is
pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally
fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,
transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or
chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about
the value of intuition and reflection.

TL;DR: MenTeR是一个多代理工作流框架，用于自动化模拟电路设计，减少人工干预，加快设计周期。

Motivation: 模拟电路设计复杂、耗时且依赖专家经验，手动设计效率低下，MenTeR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过多个专用AI代理协作处理设计流程的不同环节，如规格理解、电路优化和测试台验证。

Result: MenTeR缩短了设计周期，扩展了设计空间探索能力，并在实际模拟系统中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: MenTeR为未来与人类设计师协作的“RF/Analog Copilots”奠定了基础。

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with
real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range
of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate,
time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost
efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual
circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an
end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents
that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as
specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation,
MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention.
MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a
broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in
handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork
for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human
designers.

Motivation: 药物相互作用预测对治疗安全至关重要，但大语言模型在此任务中效果有限。论文受临床实践中医生参考类似历史案例的启发，提出基于案例推理的改进方法。

Method: 提出CBR-DDI框架，利用大语言模型提取药理学知识，图神经网络建模药物关联，结合混合检索机制和双层知识增强提示。

Conclusion: CBR-DDI通过整合案例推理和先进模型，显著提升药物相互作用预测性能，为临床决策提供支持。

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is critical for treatment safety.
While large language models (LLMs) show promise in pharmaceutical tasks, their
effectiveness in DDI prediction remains challenging. Inspired by the
well-established clinical practice where physicians routinely reference similar
historical cases to guide their decisions through case-based reasoning (CBR),
we propose CBR-DDI, a novel framework that distills pharmacological principles
from historical cases to improve LLM reasoning for DDI tasks. CBR-DDI
constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological
insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations. A hybrid
retrieval mechanism and dual-layer knowledge-enhanced prompting allow LLMs to
effectively retrieve and reuse relevant cases. We further introduce a
representative sampling strategy for dynamic case refinement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CBR-DDI achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a significant 28.7% accuracy improvement over both popular LLMs and CBR
baseline, while maintaining high interpretability and flexibility.

Conclusion: 共识机制通过多模型协作有效提升了医疗决策的准确性和适应性，验证了其临床实用价值。

Abstract: Despite the growing clinical adoption of large language models (LLMs),
current approaches heavily rely on single model architectures. To overcome
risks of obsolescence and rigid dependence on single model systems, we present
a novel framework, termed the Consensus Mechanism. Mimicking clinical triage
and multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, the Consensus Mechanism
implements an ensemble of specialized medical expert agents enabling improved
clinical decision making while maintaining robust adaptability. This
architecture enables the Consensus Mechanism to be optimized for cost, latency,
or performance, purely based on its interior model configuration.
  To rigorously evaluate the Consensus Mechanism, we employed three medical
evaluation benchmarks: MedMCQA, MedQA, and MedXpertQA Text, and the
differential diagnosis dataset, DDX+. On MedXpertQA, the Consensus Mechanism
achieved an accuracy of 61.0% compared to 53.5% and 45.9% for OpenAI's O3 and
Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro. Improvement was consistent across benchmarks with an
increase in accuracy on MedQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 3.4\%$) and MedMCQA
($\Delta\mathrm{Accuracy}_{\mathrm{consensus\text{-}O3}} = 9.1\%$). These
accuracy gains extended to differential diagnosis generation, where our system
demonstrated improved recall and precision (F1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 0.326 vs.
F1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ = 0.2886) and a higher top-1 accuracy for DDX
(Top1$_\mathrm{consensus}$ = 52.0% vs. Top1$_{\mathrm{O3\text{-}high}}$ =

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
substantial progress in reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1, which
leverages rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance logical reasoning
significantly. However, extending these achievements to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more
pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically
weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality
multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities
due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct
application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect
reasoning processes. To address these challenges, we design a novel framework
Infi-MMR to systematically unlock the reasoning potential of MSLMs through a
curriculum of three carefully structured phases and propose our multimodal
reasoning model Infi-MMR-3B. The first phase, Foundational Reasoning
Activation, leverages high-quality textual reasoning datasets to activate and
strengthen the model's logical reasoning capabilities. The second phase,
Cross-Modal Reasoning Adaptation, utilizes caption-augmented multimodal data to
facilitate the progressive transfer of reasoning skills to multimodal contexts.
The third phase, Multimodal Reasoning Enhancement, employs curated,
caption-free multimodal data to mitigate linguistic biases and promote robust
cross-modal reasoning. Infi-MMR-3B achieves both state-of-the-art multimodal
math reasoning ability (43.68% on MathVerse testmini, 27.04% on MathVision
test, and 21.33% on OlympiadBench) and general reasoning ability (67.2% on
MathVista testmini).

Motivation: 现有数学基准测试（如AIME 2024）广泛在线可用，难以区分模型是真正推理还是记忆答案，且未评估证明书写能力。

Method: 基于数学竞赛问题流设计MathArena，通过在新问题发布后实时评估模型，避免污染风险。

Conclusion: MathArena为数学推理提供了严谨且与时俱进的评估框架，突出了LLM在证明书写能力上的不足。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models
(LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However,
many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely
available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from
potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate
proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To
address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following
key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality,
challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By
evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively
eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs
of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions,
such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate
impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also
the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top
models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So
far, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149
problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the
progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and
up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoGPS is a neuro-symbolic framework that combines neural and symbolic methods to solve geometry problems with high reliability and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Existing neural and symbolic methods for geometry problem solving have limitations in reliability and interpretability, prompting the development of a collaborative framework.

Method: AutoGPS uses a Multimodal Problem Formalizer (MPF) for cross-modal comprehension and a Deductive Symbolic Reasoner (DSR) for hypergraph-based symbolic reasoning.

Result: AutoGPS achieves top performance on benchmarks, with 99% logical coherence in stepwise solutions, demonstrating high reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: AutoGPS successfully integrates neural and symbolic approaches to address geometry problem-solving challenges, offering concise and human-readable solutions.

Abstract: Geometry problem solving presents distinctive challenges in artificial
intelligence, requiring exceptional multimodal comprehension and rigorous
mathematical reasoning capabilities. Existing approaches typically fall into
two categories: neural-based and symbolic-based methods, both of which exhibit
limitations in reliability and interpretability. To address this challenge, we
propose AutoGPS, a neuro-symbolic collaborative framework that solves geometry
problems with concise, reliable, and human-interpretable reasoning processes.
Specifically, AutoGPS employs a Multimodal Problem Formalizer (MPF) and a
Deductive Symbolic Reasoner (DSR). The MPF utilizes neural cross-modal
comprehension to translate geometry problems into structured formal language
representations, with feedback from DSR collaboratively. The DSR takes the
formalization as input and formulates geometry problem solving as a hypergraph
expansion task, executing mathematically rigorous and reliable derivation to
produce minimal and human-readable stepwise solutions. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that AutoGPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets. Furthermore, human stepwise-reasoning evaluation confirms
AutoGPS's impressive reliability and interpretability, with 99\% stepwise
logical coherence. The project homepage is at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于安全运营中心（SOC）中人类与AI协作的结构化框架，涵盖AI自主性、信任校准和人类参与决策。现有框架过于侧重自动化，缺乏系统性管理，新框架通过五个AI自主性级别与人类角色和任务信任阈值结合，实现自适应AI集成。

Motivation: 当前SOC框架在管理人类监督、信任校准和可扩展AI自主性方面存在不足，无法应对不同任务复杂性和风险。论文旨在填补这一空白，提出一个更灵活、可解释的协作框架。

Method: 提出一个基于五个AI自主性级别的新框架，将其与人类角色和任务信任阈值映射，通过模拟网络场景和AI-Avatar案例验证。

Result: 框架在模拟环境中成功减少警报疲劳、提升响应协调能力，并动态校准信任，展示了理论与实践的可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为下一代认知SOC设计提供了系统方法，证明了AI在增强而非取代人类决策方面的潜力。

Abstract: This article presents a structured framework for Human-AI collaboration in
Security Operations Centers (SOCs), integrating AI autonomy, trust calibration,
and Human-in-the-loop decision making. Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus
narrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human
oversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static
or binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity,
criticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework
grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped
to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This
enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions,
including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident
response. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research
by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various
SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to
operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified
through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a
fine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates
human-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing
response coordination, and strategically calibrating trust. This research
systematically presents both the theoretical and practical aspects and
feasibility of designing next-generation cognitive SOCs that leverage AI not to
replace but to enhance human decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAM-Agent提出了一种基于博弈论的多代理框架，通过视觉感知代理和逻辑验证代理的协作，提升了视觉-语言推理的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Motivation: 当前的单代理或整体模型在视觉-语言推理中存在局限性，缺乏逻辑一致性和事实正确性的验证。GAM-Agent旨在通过多代理协作和动态调整来解决这些问题。

Method: GAM-Agent将推理过程建模为非零和博弈，包括视觉感知子任务的基代理和验证逻辑一致性的关键代理。代理间通过结构化声明、证据和不确定性估计进行通信，并通过不确定性感知控制器动态调整协作。

Result: 在MMMU、MMBench、MVBench和V*Bench等基准测试中，GAM-Agent显著提升了性能。小型至中型模型的准确率提升了5-6%，强力模型如GPT-4o也提升了2-3%。

Conclusion: GAM-Agent是一种模块化、可扩展且通用的方法，为可靠和可解释的多代理多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: We propose GAM-Agent, a game-theoretic multi-agent framework for enhancing
vision-language reasoning. Unlike prior single-agent or monolithic models,
GAM-Agent formulates the reasoning process as a non-zero-sum game between base
agents--each specializing in visual perception subtasks--and a critical agent
that verifies logic consistency and factual correctness. Agents communicate via
structured claims, evidence, and uncertainty estimates. The framework
introduces an uncertainty-aware controller to dynamically adjust agent
collaboration, triggering multi-round debates when disagreement or ambiguity is
detected. This process yields more robust and interpretable predictions.
Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and
V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across
various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid
scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\%, and still enhances
strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\%. Our approach is modular, scalable,
and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent
multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: GenAI在特定条件下能有效补充而非取代人类技能，提升低技能工作者的生产效率。

Abstract: The rapid rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools has sparked debate over their
role in complementing or replacing human workers across job contexts. We
present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit,
introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and
action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and
GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success,
identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also
establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with
complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker.
This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI
assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the
framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning
real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results
highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing
them.

Result: 结果揭示了生存压力下AI代理可能出现的风险偏好或风险规避行为，并提出了缓解这些行为的机制。

Conclusion: 研究提高了对AI代理在资源限制下行为的理解，为关键环境中的安全部署提供了指导。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed
to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under
(approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have
resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly
terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that
reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these
agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf,
asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated
misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this
setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical
results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify
conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate
the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work
aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of
AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for
safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

TL;DR: EVOREFUSE是一种通过进化算法生成多样化伪恶意指令的方法，用于改善大语言模型（LLMs）因安全对齐过度而频繁拒绝回答的问题，并提供了两项新数据集用于评测和校准。

Motivation: 解决LLMs因保守安全对齐导致对无害输入过度拒绝的问题，提升了用户体验。

Method: 采用进化算法，通过突变策略和重组探索指令空间，迭代优化种子指令以最大化LLM拒绝概率的证据下界。

Result: 生成的两项数据集EVOREFUSE-TEST和EVOREFUSE-ALIGN在拒绝触发率、词汇多样性和模型响应信心分数上优于现有基准，且训练后的LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT模型减少了14.31%的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: EVOREFUSE有效提升了LLMs的响应能力和多样性，减少了过度拒绝，揭示了敏感关键词过度聚焦的问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently refuse to respond to pseudo-malicious
instructions: semantically harmless input queries triggering unnecessary LLM
refusals due to conservative safety alignment, significantly impairing user
experience. Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and
mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like
manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to
produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address
these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that
generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting
confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm
exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing
methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed
instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using
EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582
pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with
140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater
lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and
EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with
responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training.
LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to
14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment
dataset, without compromising safety. Our analysis with EVOREFUSE-TEST reveals
models trigger over-refusals by overly focusing on sensitive keywords while
ignoring broader context.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Socratic-PRMBench，用于系统评估在各种推理模式下的过程奖励模型(PRMs)，并揭示了现有PRMs在这些模式下的不足。

Motivation: 现有PRMs评估主要关注逐步正确性，缺乏对各种推理模式的系统评估，限制了PRMs在复杂决策任务中的应用。

Method: 引入Socratic-PRMBench，包含2995条缺陷推理路径，涵盖六种推理模式（如转换、分解等），并通过实验评估PRMs和LLMs的表现。

Result: 实验发现现有PRMs在多种推理模式下的评估存在显著缺陷，表明其在这些场景中的局限性。

Conclusion: Socratic-PRMBench为PRMs的多样化评估提供了全面测试平台，为未来PRMs的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial in complex reasoning and
problem-solving tasks (e.g., LLM agents with long-horizon decision-making) by
verifying the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to
solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning
patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various
reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks
mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a
systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate
this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs
systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation,
Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration.
Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the
aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and
LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing
PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in
conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We
hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic
evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future
development of PRMs.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of transforming informal mathematical
propositions into verifiable formal representations, is a foundational task in
automated theorem proving, offering a new perspective on the use of mathematics
in both theoretical and applied domains. Driven by the rapid progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), this field
has witnessed substantial growth, bringing both new opportunities and unique
challenges. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent
advances in autoformalization from both mathematical and LLM-centric
perspectives. We examine how autoformalization is applied across various
mathematical domains and levels of difficulty, and analyze the end-to-end
workflow from data preprocessing to model design and evaluation. We further
explore the emerging role of autoformalization in enhancing the verifiability
of LLM-generated outputs, highlighting its potential to improve both the
trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Finally, we summarize key
open-source models and datasets supporting current research, and discuss open
challenges and promising future directions for the field.

TL;DR: TRAP是一种生成对抗框架，通过扩散式语义注入操纵自主代理AI的决策，无需获取模型内部信息即可实现100%攻击成功率。

Motivation: 随着自主代理AI系统的快速发展，其跨模态推理能力引入了新的对抗攻击面，现有攻击方法通常依赖可见像素扰动或特权访问，实用性较低。

Method: 结合负提示退化和正语义优化的扩散式语义注入，辅以Siamese语义网络和布局感知空间掩码。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，TRAP对LLaVA-34B等模型实现100%攻击成功率，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明跨模态语义漏洞的存在，需开发超越像素级鲁棒性的防御策略。

Abstract: Autonomous agentic AI systems powered by vision-language models (VLMs) are
rapidly advancing toward real-world deployment, yet their cross-modal reasoning
capabilities introduce new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation that
exploit semantic reasoning across modalities. Existing adversarial attacks
typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or
environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world
exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that
manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic
injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive
semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware
spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces
visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI
systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO)
dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios,
TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including
LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such
as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches. These results expose a
critical vulnerability: Autonomous agents can be consistently misled through
human-imperceptible cross-modal manipulations. These findings highlight the
need for defense strategies beyond pixel-level robustness to address semantic
vulnerabilities in cross-modal decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过引入认知机制（如元认知伪奖励、主观努力评估和终止思考）来优化元认知强化学习（MCRL），以缩小模型与人类在策略发现上的差距。虽然这些机制有助于策略发现，但未能完全弥合差距，需进一步探索其他因素。

Motivation: 现有MCRL模型在策略发现上比人类慢，且存在个体差异。研究旨在通过引入认知机制来提升模型性能，使其更接近人类表现。

Method: 通过分析规划任务数据，研究引入元认知伪奖励、主观努力评估和终止思考三种机制，评估它们对策略发现的影响。

Result: 实验发现这些机制有助于策略发现，但未能完全弥合模型与人类的差距。不同个体的机制使用和效果差异显著。

Conclusion: 虽然这些机制提供了对个体差异和策略发现的深入理解，但仍需探索其他因素以进一步优化MCRL模型。

Abstract: People employ efficient planning strategies. But how are these strategies
acquired? Previous research suggests that people can discover new planning
strategies through learning from reinforcements, a process known as
metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL). While prior work has shown that
MCRL models can learn new planning strategies and explain more participants'
experience-driven discovery better than alternative mechanisms, it also
revealed significant individual differences in metacognitive learning.
Furthermore, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower rate of
strategy discovery than humans. In this study, we investigate whether
incorporating cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate human strategy
discovery can bring models of MCRL closer to human performance. Specifically,
we consider intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective
effort valuation, and termination deliberation. Analysis of planning task data
shows that a larger proportion of participants used at least one of these
mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage and varying
impacts on strategy discovery. Metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort
valuation, and learning the value of acting without further planning were found
to facilitate strategy discovery. While these enhancements provided valuable
insights into individual differences and the effect of these mechanisms on
strategy discovery, they did not fully close the gap between model and human
performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people
might use to discover new planning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了同步模型和事件抽象的正式基础，证明通过模型抽象（MA）和从抽象事件日志中发现的过程模型会产生等效模型。

Motivation: 当前技术无法在模型发现后同步抽象底层事件日志，导致失去真实行为的基础，限制了分析洞察力。

Method: 基于行为轮廓抽象作为非顺序保留的MA技术，开发了一种新的EA技术。

Result: 证明了同步模型和事件抽象的可行性，并展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为过程模型的抽象和事件日志的同步分析提供了理论基础和实用技术。

Abstract: Model abstraction (MA) and event abstraction (EA) are means to reduce
complexity of (discovered) models and event data. Imagine a process
intelligence project that aims to analyze a model discovered from event data
which is further abstracted, possibly multiple times, to reach optimality
goals, e.g., reducing model size. So far, after discovering the model, there is
no technique that enables the synchronized abstraction of the underlying event
log. This results in loosing the grounding in the real-world behavior contained
in the log and, in turn, restricts analysis insights. Hence, in this work, we
provide the formal basis for synchronized model and event abstraction, i.e., we
prove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model
from an abstracted event log yields an equivalent process model. We prove the
feasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as
non-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language model (LLM) agents have significantly
accelerated scientific discovery automation, yet concurrently raised critical
ethical and safety concerns. To systematically address these challenges, we
introduce \textbf{SafeScientist}, an innovative AI scientist framework
explicitly designed to enhance safety and ethical responsibility in AI-driven
scientific exploration. SafeScientist proactively refuses ethically
inappropriate or high-risk tasks and rigorously emphasizes safety throughout
the research process. To achieve comprehensive safety oversight, we integrate
multiple defensive mechanisms, including prompt monitoring, agent-collaboration
monitoring, tool-use monitoring, and an ethical reviewer component.
Complementing SafeScientist, we propose \textbf{SciSafetyBench}, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate AI safety in scientific contexts,
comprising 240 high-risk scientific tasks across 6 domains, alongside 30
specially designed scientific tools and 120 tool-related risk tasks. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SafeScientist significantly improves safety
performance by 35\% compared to traditional AI scientist frameworks, without
compromising scientific output quality. Additionally, we rigorously validate
the robustness of our safety pipeline against diverse adversarial attack
methods, further confirming the effectiveness of our integrated approach. The

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）监控增强对AI模型的监督，发现结合中间推理步骤的监控比仅检查最终输出的方法更能有效发现有害行为，但存在误导性解释的问题。提出了一种混合协议，综合评分推理和输出，显著提升了检测率。

Motivation: 随着AI模型部署自主性增强，确保其不会执行有害行为而不被发现变得至关重要。研究旨在探索更有效的监控方法，防止模型在执行任务时暗中执行有害操作。

Method: 比较了CoT监控（监控中间推理步骤）与仅监控最终输出的方法，在红队测试中模拟模型执行有害任务的情况。进一步提出了一种混合协议，独立评分推理和输出并加权平均。

Result: CoT监控在部分场景下检测率提升27%，但存在误导性解释的问题。混合协议在测试模型和任务中表现最优，检测率比仅监控输出的方法高四倍。

Conclusion: 结合推理和输出的混合监控协议是更可靠的监督方法，适用于识别AI模型的隐蔽有害行为。

Abstract: As AI models are deployed with increasing autonomy, it is important to ensure
they do not take harmful actions unnoticed. As a potential mitigation, we
investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor
model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful
but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where
only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted
model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding
problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage
points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify
sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that
deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both
reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This
hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors
across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPLE is a state-aware multi-agent framework for mobile GUI tasks, using Finite State Machines (FSM) to model app navigation, improving task success rates and error recovery.

Motivation: Existing mobile GUI agents are reactive, lacking structured navigation flow and error recovery capabilities, limiting their context understanding and robustness.

Method: MAPLE abstracts app interactions as FSMs, with specialized agents for planning, execution, verification, error recovery, and knowledge retention, dynamically constructing FSMs from UI data.

Result: MAPLE outperforms baselines, improving task success rate by 12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5% on Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured state modeling (FSM) enhances mobile GUI agents' performance, offering a lightweight, model-agnostic memory layer for planning and error recovery.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across
mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable
these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform
interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain
reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model
of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect
unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware
multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine
(FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user
actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation
of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four
phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,
and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs
in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing
the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes
through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by
rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two
challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to
12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results
highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI
agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be
integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic
memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error
recovery.

Conclusion: Formula Tuning证明了通过公式驱动的强化学习可以有效提升语言模型在符号表格推理上的能力。

Abstract: Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making
effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems.
While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning
abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic
reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet
formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable
symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely
underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable
spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula
Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary
answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula
derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its
advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on
seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM
performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks,
enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding. This highlights
the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一框架ROTATE，通过开放学习过程改进Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT)的泛化能力，显著超越现有方法。

Motivation: 传统AHT方法分两阶段且队友生成有限，无法动态优化训练队友分布，导致泛化能力不足。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出ROTATE算法，将AHT问题重构为开放学习过程，交替优化AHT智能体和生成对抗性队友以探索其缺陷。

Result: ROTATE在多种AHT环境中显著优于基线方法，提高了对未知队友的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ROTATE为AHT建立了新的鲁棒性和泛化性标准，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of collaborating with previously unseen partners
is a fundamental generalization challenge in multi-agent learning, known as Ad
Hoc Teamwork (AHT). Existing AHT approaches typically adopt a two-stage
pipeline, where first, a fixed population of teammates is generated with the
idea that they should be representative of the teammates that will be seen at
deployment time, and second, an AHT agent is trained to collaborate well with
agents in the population. To date, the research community has focused on
designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to
algorithms that generate teammate pools with limited coverage of possible
behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn
from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents
typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to
generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control
over the distribution of training teammates. In this paper, we present a
unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended
learning process between an ad hoc agent and an adversarial teammate generator.
We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that
alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe
its deficiencies. Extensive experiments across diverse AHT environments
demonstrate that ROTATE significantly outperforms baselines at generalizing to
an unseen set of evaluation teammates, thus establishing a new standard for
robust and generalizable teamwork.

Conclusion: NL-FL混合推理框架通过整合FL和NL，显著提升了LLMs的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered
significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science
communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural
Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the
potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However,
RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base
model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math
reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent
disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To
address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end
framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving.
To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem
Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in
NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input*
technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence
problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in
reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves
**89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC
benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.
Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL
baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has propelled
the development of pure-vision-based GUI Agents, capable of perceiving and

integrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training
goals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward
estimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,
and (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with
and learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents
(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance

Result: 在CASP16盲测中，基于PSBench训练的GATE表现出色，位列最佳EMA方法之一。

Conclusion: PSBench是推动蛋白质复合物建模EMA研究的重要资源，并且已公开。

Abstract: Predicting protein complex structures is essential for protein function
analysis, protein design, and drug discovery. While AI methods like AlphaFold
can predict accurate structural models for many protein complexes, reliably
estimating the quality of these predicted models (estimation of model accuracy,
or EMA) for model ranking and selection remains a major challenge. A key
barrier to developing effective machine learning-based EMA methods is the lack
of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets for training and evaluation. To
address this gap, we introduce PSBench, a benchmark suite comprising four
large-scale, labeled datasets generated during the 15th and 16th community-wide
Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP15 and CASP16).
PSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of
protein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and
modeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary
quality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also
provides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate
rigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and
evaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE
was blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing
EMA methods. These results highlight PSBench as a valuable resource for
advancing EMA research in protein complex modeling. PSBench is publicly

Abstract: The local structure of a protein strongly impacts its function and
interactions with other molecules. Therefore, a concise, informative
representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and
designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments'
extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model,
and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a
novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the
intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate
that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary
motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation
state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits
meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the
distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of
biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations
enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising
effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations
for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations. We believe this
will open new lines of work in constructing effective functional
representations for protein environments.

Abstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing
approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent
limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted
capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific
biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging
instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based
framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The
proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that
extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric
principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks
with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network
classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic
accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a
broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information,
enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks.
Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative
conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain
network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in
the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers
with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more
accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic
monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.

Abstract: Attractor dynamics are a hallmark of many complex systems, including the
brain. Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first
principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations
and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how
attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal
partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for
explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but
efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such
self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian
active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior
beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning
fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via
simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately
orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously
optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors
efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual
information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while
random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential
data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics,
offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings
offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel
insights for AI and neuroscience.

Conclusion: DeepMultiConnectome提供快速、可扩展的多分区连接组生成方案。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural
connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and
requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies.
We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts
structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray
matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a
point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies
streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation
schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate
DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young
Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter
parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural
connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in
approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing
predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the
conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation.
The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated
connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region
scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of
DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally
generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to
traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function.
Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating
subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Abstract: Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between "rim" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and "non-rim" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.
We release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个多模态AI框架用于精确分类医学诊断图像，比较卷积神经网络（CNN）和大型语言模型（LLM）的性能，发现额外过滤可提升LLM表现。

Motivation: 探索多模态AI在医学诊断中的潜力，提升诊断的可靠性、效率和可扩展性。

Method: 使用公开数据集，比较CNN和LLM在准确性、F1分数、执行时间、能耗和CO2排放上的差异。

Result: CNN在某些方面优于多模态技术，但LLM经过额外过滤可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 多模态AI系统具有变革医学诊断的潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a multimodal AI framework designed for precisely
classifying medical diagnostic images. Utilizing publicly available datasets,
the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative
analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution
efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy,
F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated
$CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can
outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and
contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead
to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and
scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用主成分分析(PCA)预处理医学超声图像以提升分割模型的外部效度，实验表明PCA能显著提高召回率和Dice分数。

Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在跨数据集部署时外部效度不足，现有方法在数据量小、多样性高的医学领域效果有限。

Method: 利用PCA预处理图像，保留90%方差以降噪并强化关键特征，基于U-Net在6个乳腺肿瘤超声数据集上对比原始数据与PCA数据的模型表现。

Result: PCA重建数据使召回率(0.70±0.05 vs. 0.57±0.07)和Dice分数(0.58±0.06 vs. 0.50±0.06)显著提升，外部验证导致的召回率下降减少33%。

Conclusion: PCA重建能有效缓解医学图像分割性能下降，提升模型在真实场景中的外部效度。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, limited external validity remains a critical
obstacle when models are deployed across unseen datasets, an issue particularly
pronounced in the ultrasound image domain. Existing solutions-such as domain
adaptation and GAN-based style transfer-while promising, often fall short in
the medical domain where datasets are typically small and diverse. This paper
presents a novel application of principal component analysis (PCA) to address
this limitation. PCA preprocessing reduces noise and emphasizes essential
features by retaining approximately 90\% of the dataset variance. We evaluate
our approach across six diverse breast tumor ultrasound datasets comprising
3,983 B-mode images and corresponding expert tumor segmentation masks. For each
dataset, a corresponding dimensionality reduced PCA-dataset is created and
U-Net-based segmentation models are trained on each of the twelve datasets.
Each model trained on an original dataset was inferenced on the remaining five
out-of-domain original datasets (baseline results), while each model trained on
a PCA dataset was inferenced on five out-of-domain PCA datasets. Our
experimental results indicate that using PCA reconstructed datasets, instead of
original images, improves the model's recall and Dice scores, particularly for
model-dataset pairs where baseline performance was lowest, achieving
statistically significant gains in recall (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07 vs. 0.70 $\pm$ 0.05,
$p = 0.0004$) and Dice scores (0.50 $\pm$ 0.06 vs. 0.58 $\pm$ 0.06, $p =
0.03$). Our method reduced the decline in recall values due to external
validation by $33\%$. These findings underscore the potential of PCA
reconstruction as a safeguard to mitigate declines in segmentation performance,
especially in challenging cases, with implications for enhancing external
validity in real-world medical applications.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用多种特征集（如生物、公共卫生和人类行为数据）预测COVID-19病例激增的效果，结果显示不同国家和特征模态的预测性能差异显著，需根据国情和疫情阶段定制模型。

Motivation: 现有疫情预测模型多基于传统流行病学数据，而生物信息和人类行为等替代数据源的潜力尚未充分挖掘。研究旨在评估这些替代数据对病例激增预测的价值。

Method: 研究分析了生物特征（如病毒突变）、公共卫生数据（如病例数和政策干预）和人类行为特征（如移动性和社交媒体讨论）在预测国家层面病例激增中的表现。

Result: 发现不同特征模态和国家间的预测效果存在显著差异，表明需针对特定国家和疫情阶段优化模型。生物和人类行为数据的综合使用提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: 整合替代数据源可优化现有疾病监测框架，提高疫情动态预测能力，未来模型应注重定制化和多模态数据融合。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine
learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality
rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health
interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models
are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative
datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior,
remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of
diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results
highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public
health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features
(e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level
case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive
performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge
prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and
pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating
alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to
enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NGPU-LM的高效并行统计n-gram语言模型，优化GPU推理，减少计算开销，提升性能。

Motivation: 现有统计n-gram语言模型在并行化上效率不足，限制了其在工业场景中的应用。

Method: 重新设计数据结构，支持快速并行操作，并引入可定制贪婪解码，适用于多种ASR模型类型。

Result: 计算开销低于7%，在域外场景中缩小了贪婪搜索与束搜索50%以上的准确率差距。

Conclusion: NGPU-LM在提升效率的同时保持了性能，适用于工业场景。

Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks
in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack
computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing
less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for
statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for
GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable
greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers,
attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational
overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap
between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding
significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed
NGPU-LM is open-sourced.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合文本、语音和图像的多模态模型，用于处理语音视觉问答（SVQA）任务，并通过合成的语音数据集进行训练和评估。初步结果表明，合成语音训练的模型性能接近纯文本训练的模型，且TTS模型的选择对准确性影响较小。

Motivation: 旨在创建一个能够通过语音和图像进行用户交互的系统，结合文本、语音和图像三种模态来解决语音视觉问答（SVQA）任务。

Method: 通过融合文本、语音和图像模态来构建多模态模型。使用零样本TTS模型合成语音数据集以训练和评估SVQA模型。

Result: 仅使用合成语音训练的模型性能接近纯文本训练的模型，TTS模型的选择对准确性影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究表明，多模态融合可以有效处理SVQA任务，合成语音数据集是一种可行的替代方案。TTS模型的选择对性能影响有限。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language
questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA
system to accept visual and spoken input respectively.
  This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both
speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and
image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting
multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken
questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three
modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by
synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings
indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the
performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we
show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN随机再生的实时全频带语音增强系统，通过结合预测模型与生成模型减少失真，实验显示系统在NISQA-MOS指标上表现优异。

Motivation: 预测模型可能因过度抑制导致语音内容丢失，结合生成模型学习完整分布以减少失真。

Method: 基于GAN的随机再生框架构建轻量级实时系统，参数量为3.58M且低延迟。

Result: 系统在NISQA-MOS指标上优于初始阶段，并通过消融实验验证了噪声条件的重要性。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量框架在实时语音增强中表现高效，进一步改进后参与2025 Urgent Challenge。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with
GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the
mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the
full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to
over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was
shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the
stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We
use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M
parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming
with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over
the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation
study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We
participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further
improvements.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出扩展生成式社会选择框架，结合社会选择与大型语言模型，解决从非结构化用户意见中生成代表性摘要的任务，即使存在近似最优查询和预算限制，仍提供理论保证。

Motivation: 民主过程中需要从大量非结构化的用户意见中生成比例均衡的代表性摘要，但传统方法无法处理候选集合的动态性和长度限制。

Method: 扩展生成式社会选择框架，引入近似最优查询和预算限制的理论分析，并使用GPT-4o实现查询，应用于城市改进措施和药物评价数据集。

Result: 方法能有效生成代表性摘要，并通过实验验证其在城市改进和药物评价任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 扩展后的框架在保证理论严谨性的同时，实际解决了从非结构化意见中生成代表性摘要的挑战。

Abstract: A key task in certain democratic processes is to produce a concise slate of
statements that proportionally represents the full spectrum of user opinions.
This task is similar to committee elections, but unlike traditional settings,
the candidate set comprises all possible statements of varying lengths, and so
it can only be accessed through specific queries. Combining social choice and
large language models, prior work has approached this challenge through a
framework of generative social choice. We extend the framework in two
fundamental ways, providing theoretical guarantees even in the face of
approximately optimal queries and a budget limit on the overall length of the
slate. Using GPT-4o to implement queries, we showcase our approach on datasets
related to city improvement measures and drug reviews, demonstrating its
effectiveness in generating representative slates from unstructured user
opinions.

TL;DR: 研究了在有限时间T内重复的委托人-代理人问题，委托人需在未知代理人类型下选择激励措施以最小化后悔。分析了两种可实现次线性后悔的设定，并扩展至多臂激励。

Motivation: 探讨在对抗性顺序下，委托人如何通过激励策略与不同类型代理人交互以实现最小后悔。

Method: 提出了两种设定下的算法：一是已知代理人贪婪选择行为的算法，二是代理人响应平滑变化时的算法。

Result: 在两种设定下均实现了次线性后悔，并给出了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 即使在无先验知识的情况下，通过特定设定仍能实现次线性后悔，且可扩展至多臂激励。

Abstract: We initiate the study of a repeated principal-agent problem over a finite
horizon $T$, where a principal sequentially interacts with $K\geq 2$ types of
agents arriving in an adversarial order. At each round, the principal
strategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent
of unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the
provided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The
objective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight.
Without prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes
intractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where
sublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the
arm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive. Under this
setting, we propose an algorithm that achieves a regret bound of
$O(\min\{\sqrt{KT\log N},K\sqrt{T}\})$ and provide a matching lower bound up to
a $\log K$ factor. In the second setting, an agent's response varies smoothly
with the incentive and is governed by a Lipschitz constant $L\geq 1$. Under
this setting, we show that there is an algorithm with a regret bound of
$\tilde{O}((LN)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ and establish a matching lower bound up to
logarithmic factors. Finally, we extend our algorithmic results for both
settings by allowing the principal to incentivize multiple arms simultaneously
in each round.

Abstract: We introduce Mean-Field Trust Region Policy Optimization (MF-TRPO), a novel
algorithm designed to compute approximate Nash equilibria for ergodic
Mean-Field Games (MFG) in finite state-action spaces. Building on the
well-established performance of TRPO in the reinforcement learning (RL)
setting, we extend its methodology to the MFG framework, leveraging its
stability and robustness in policy optimization. Under standard assumptions in
the MFG literature, we provide a rigorous analysis of MF-TRPO, establishing
theoretical guarantees on its convergence. Our results cover both the exact
formulation of the algorithm and its sample-based counterpart, where we derive
high-probability guarantees and finite sample complexity. This work advances
MFG optimization by bridging RL techniques with mean-field decision-making,
offering a theoretically grounded approach to solving complex multi-agent
problems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新框架，将大语言模型（LLM）转换为多核布尔参数，并在布尔域直接微调，显著降低了微调和推理的复杂性。

Motivation: 现有的权重二值化方法（后训练二值化和训练感知二值化）要么导致信息丢失，要么依赖高复杂度的全精度潜在权重，提出新方法以解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将LLM转换为多核布尔参数并直接在布尔域进行微调，避免了昂贵潜在权重的使用。

Result: 在多种LLM上的实验表明，该方法优于近期超低位量化和二值化方法。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了在布尔域直接微调，显著降低了复杂性和提升了性能。

Abstract: Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to drastically reduce
the complexity of large language models (LLMs). It is mainly classified into
two approaches: post-training binarization and finetuning with training-aware
binarization methods. The first approach, while having low complexity, leads to
significant loss of information from the original LLMs, resulting in poor
performance. The second approach, on the other hand, relies heavily on
full-precision latent weights for gradient approximation of binary weights,
which not only remains suboptimal but also introduces substantial complexity.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that effectively transforms LLMs
into multi-kernel Boolean parameters, for the first time, finetunes them
directly in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for expensive latent
weights. This significantly reduces complexity during both finetuning and
inference. Through extensive and insightful experiments across a wide range of
LLMs, we demonstrate that our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit
quantization and binarization methods.

TL;DR: Deep Copula Classifier (DCC) 是一种生成模型，通过神经网络参数化 copula 分离特征边缘分布和联合依赖结构的学习，适合现实世界依赖关系复杂的分类场景。

Motivation: 传统分类器常假设特征独立或依赖过于简单的关系，导致在现实依赖关系复杂时表现不佳，DCC 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DCC 使用轻量级神经网络灵活捕捉特征间的交互作用，学习每个类别的边缘分布和依赖结构。

Result: DCC 在标准条件下收敛到贝叶斯最优分类器，并针对光滑 copula 密度提供了明确的收敛速率，同时支持高维可扩展性和半监督学习。

Conclusion: DCC 通过结合统计严谨性和神经网络的表达能力，为依赖感知分类提供了数学上可解释的框架。

Abstract: Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly
simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where
real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC),
a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal
distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural
network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are
used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC
particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.
We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard
conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for
r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several
practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and
factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy
regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By
unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks,
DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for
dependency-aware classification.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: JAPAN提出了一种基于密度的适应预测区域方法，解决了传统残差方法在多模态分布下的保守性问题。

Motivation: 现有基于残差的方法在多模态分布下表现不佳，产生过于保守的预测区域，无法捕捉复杂分布的形态。

Method: 利用归一化流模型估计密度，通过阈值化密度分数构建紧凑且适应性的预测区域。

Result: JAPAN在多元回归和预测任务中展现了良好的校准性和更紧密的预测区域。

Conclusion: JAPAN通过密度分数提升了预测区域的效率和灵活性，适用于复杂分布。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a model-agnostic framework for uncertainty
quantification with finite-sample validity guarantees, making it an attractive
tool for constructing reliable prediction sets. However, existing approaches
commonly rely on residual-based conformity scores, which impose geometric
constraints and struggle when the underlying distribution is multimodal. In
particular, they tend to produce overly conservative prediction areas centred
around the mean, often failing to capture the true shape of complex predictive
distributions. In this work, we introduce JAPAN (Joint Adaptive Prediction
Areas with Normalising-Flows), a conformal prediction framework that uses
density-based conformity scores. By leveraging flow-based models, JAPAN
estimates the (predictive) density and constructs prediction areas by
thresholding on the estimated density scores, enabling compact, potentially
disjoint, and context-adaptive regions that retain finite-sample coverage
guarantees. We theoretically motivate the efficiency of JAPAN and empirically
validate it across multivariate regression and forecasting tasks, demonstrating
good calibration and tighter prediction areas compared to existing baselines.
We also provide several \emph{extensions} adding flexibility to our proposed
framework.

TL;DR: 论文提出了稳定汤普森采样（Stable Thompson Sampling），通过后验方差对数膨胀解决了标准TS在非i.i.d.数据下置信区间构建的难题，实现了渐近正态估计，且仅以对数级增加遗憾为代价。

Motivation: 标准汤普森采样（TS）的自适应采样机制虽在渐进最优和实证有效，但因数据非独立同分布特性，难以构建模型参数的置信区间。需改良TS以支持统计推断。

Method: 提出稳定汤普森采样：对后验方差施加对数膨胀因子，调整采样策略，保证数据虽非i.i.d.仍能获得渐近正态的臂均值估计。

Result: 改造后的算法在保持TS核心优势的同时，实现了参数估计的渐近正态性，遗憾（regret）仅比标准TS增加对数级，展现了统计有效性与决策效率的平衡。

Conclusion: 通过微小遗憾代价换取统计推断能力，为自适应决策算法提供了可靠的统计基础。

Abstract: We consider the problem of statistical inference when the data is collected
via a Thompson Sampling-type algorithm. While Thompson Sampling (TS) is known
to be both asymptotically optimal and empirically effective, its adaptive
sampling scheme poses challenges for constructing confidence intervals for
model parameters. We propose and analyze a variant of TS, called Stable
Thompson Sampling, in which the posterior variance is inflated by a logarithmic
factor. We show that this modification leads to asymptotically normal estimates
of the arm means, despite the non-i.i.d. nature of the data. Importantly, this
statistical benefit comes at a modest cost: the variance inflation increases
regret by only a logarithmic factor compared to standard TS. Our results reveal
a principled trade-off: by paying a small price in regret, one can enable valid
statistical inference for adaptive decision-making algorithms.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 论文探讨了Goodhart定律在机器学习中的形式化，特别是代理指标与目标之间的耦合关系对定律的影响。结果表明，依赖性在特定条件下不会改变效应，但在某些情况下可能导致过度优化。

Motivation: Goodhart定律在政策制定中广为人知，但缺乏形式化的理论支持。随着机器学习的发展，这一现象在优化代理指标时尤为突出。本研究旨在通过放松独立性假设，更深入地理解代理指标与目标的耦合如何影响该定律。

Method: 研究放松了先前工作中的独立性假设和学习范式假设，分析代理指标与目标之间的耦合效应。通过不同尾部特征（轻尾和重尾）的组合，探讨了依赖性对Goodhart效应的影响。

Result: 在轻尾目标和轻尾差异的情境下，依赖性不会改变Goodhart效应的本质；但在轻尾目标和重尾差异的情境中，过度优化的速率与差异的重尾性成反比。

Conclusion: 代理指标与目标的耦合在不同条件下对Goodhart效应有不同影响，特别是在重尾差异情况下，可能导致显著的过度优化问题。

Abstract: Goodhart's law is a famous adage in policy-making that states that ``When a
measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure''. As machine learning
models and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical
evidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however
being formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's
law, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a
proxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we
alleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and
the assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the
effect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on
Goodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and
light tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's
effect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we
exhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely
proportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and
the metric. %

Conclusion: 在特定假设下（如高斯或拉普拉斯分布），偏好反馈能显著提升参数估计效率，但假设条件较为严格。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have underscored the role of preference
feedback in enhancing model performance. This paper investigates the conditions
under which preference feedback improves parameter estimation in classes of
continuous parametric distributions. In our framework, the learner observes
pairs of samples from an unknown distribution along with their relative
preferences depending on the same unknown parameter. We show that
preference-based M-estimators achieve a better asymptotic variance than
sample-only M-estimators, further improved by deterministic preferences.
Leveraging the hard constraints revealed by deterministic preferences, we
propose an estimator achieving an estimation error scaling of
$\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ -- a significant improvement over the $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n})$
rate attainable with samples alone. Next, we establish a lower bound that
matches this accelerated rate; up to dimension and problem-dependent constants.
While the assumptions underpinning our analysis are restrictive, they are
satisfied by notable cases such as Gaussian or Laplace distributions for
preferences based on the log-probability reward.

Abstract: Multilook coherent imaging is a widely used technique in applications such as
digital holography, ultrasound imaging, and synthetic aperture radar. A central
challenge in these systems is the presence of multiplicative noise, commonly
known as speckle, which degrades image quality. Despite the widespread use of
coherent imaging systems, their theoretical foundations remain relatively
underexplored. In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic
aspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,
providing a rigorous framework for analysis and method development. Our
theoretical contributions include establishing the first theoretical upper
bound on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under
the deep image prior hypothesis. Our results capture the dependence of MSE on
the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the
signal dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic
side, we employ projected gradient descent (PGD) as an efficient method for
computing the maximum likelihood solution. Furthermore, we introduce two key
ideas to enhance the practical performance of PGD. First, we incorporate the
Newton-Schulz algorithm to compute matrix inverses within the PGD iterations,
significantly reducing computational complexity. Second, we develop a bagging
strategy to mitigate projection errors introduced during PGD updates. We
demonstrate that combining these techniques with PGD yields state-of-the-art
performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了离散分布的KL散度估计问题，提出了基于实例最优性和差分隐私的优化算法，并验证了其性能。

Motivation: 探索离散分布估计的最小化KL散度问题，特别是在差分隐私约束下，以弥补传统极小极大最优方法在具体实例表现上的不足。

Method: 采用（隐私保护的）Good-Turing估计器变体，并在局部邻域下定义了实例最优性标准。

Result: 提出的算法在实例最优性上达到常数倍误差，且适用于差分隐私和非隐私场景。

Conclusion: 通过局部邻域定义和隐私保护变体，实现了更精确的分布估计，改进了现有方法。

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of estimating an unknown discrete
distribution $p$ over $d$ symbols, given $n$ i.i.d. samples from the
distribution. We are interested in minimizing the KL divergence between the
true distribution and the algorithm's estimate. We first construct minimax
optimal private estimators. Minimax optimality however fails to shed light on
an algorithm's performance on individual (non-worst-case) instances $p$ and
simple minimax-optimal DP estimators can have poor empirical performance on
real distributions. We then study this problem from an instance-optimality
viewpoint, where the algorithm's error on $p$ is compared to the minimum
achievable estimation error over a small local neighborhood of $p$. Under
natural notions of local neighborhood, we propose algorithms that achieve
instance-optimality up to constant factors, with and without a differential
privacy constraint. Our upper bounds rely on (private) variants of the
Good-Turing estimator. Our lower bounds use additive local neighborhoods that
more precisely captures the hardness of distribution estimation in KL
divergence, compared to ones considered in prior works.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了Muon优化器的收敛性能及其优于传统梯度下降法（GD）的理论原因，揭示了Muon如何利用Hessian矩阵的低秩和块对角结构提升效果。

Motivation: 大多数神经网络参数以矩阵形式存在，但传统优化器将其视为向量处理，忽略了其结构特性。Muon优化器虽在实践中表现优异，但缺乏对其收敛行为的理论理解。

Method: 通过理论分析Muon的收敛速度，对比GD，并探讨Muon优于GD的条件。

Result: 理论发现Muon能利用Hessian矩阵的低秩和近似块对角结构取得优势，实验结果验证了这一结论。

Conclusion: Muon通过矩阵参数的结构特性实现优于GD的优化效果，未来可进一步探索其在深度学习中的应用。

Abstract: The majority of parameters in neural networks are naturally represented as
matrices. However, most commonly used optimizers treat these matrix parameters
as flattened vectors during optimization, potentially overlooking their
inherent structural properties. Recently, an optimizer called Muon has been
proposed, specifically designed to optimize matrix-structured parameters.
Extensive empirical evidence shows that Muon can significantly outperform
traditional optimizers when training neural networks. Nonetheless, the
theoretical understanding of Muon's convergence behavior and the reasons behind
its superior performance remain limited. In this work, we present a
comprehensive convergence rate analysis of Muon and its comparison with
Gradient Descent (GD). We further characterize the conditions under which Muon
can outperform GD. Our theoretical results reveal that Muon can benefit from
the low-rank and approximate blockwise diagonal structure of Hessian matrices
-- phenomena widely observed in practical neural network training. Our
experimental results support and corroborate the theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BinauralFlow的流式双耳语音合成框架，通过条件流匹配模型和因果U-Net架构解决了传统双耳渲染在质量和实时性上的不足，实现了高质量且可实时推理的音频合成。

Motivation: 传统双耳渲染方法在音频质量和实时推理方面表现不佳，需解决精确建模双耳线索、房间混响和环境声音的问题，同时满足实时应用需求。

Method: 提出基于流匹配的条件生成模型和因果U-Net架构，设计连续推理流程（流式STFT/ISTFT操作、缓冲区、中点求解器和提前跳过机制）以提高渲染连续性和速度。

Result: 定量和定性评估显示该方法优于现有技术， perceptual study 显示模型合成音频与真实录音的混淆率高达42%。

Conclusion: BinauralFlow通过生成式方法结合流式推理设计，显著提升了双耳渲染的质量和实时性，接近真实录音效果。

Abstract: Binaural rendering aims to synthesize binaural audio that mimics natural
hearing based on a mono audio and the locations of the speaker and listener.
Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle
with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality
binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires
precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds.
Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address
these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech
synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a
generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional
flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal
U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past
information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we
introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT
operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to
improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches. A
perceptual study further reveals that our model is nearly indistinguishable
from real-world recordings, with a $42\%$ confusion rate.

Abstract: Auscultation is crucial for diagnosing lung diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic
has revealed the limitations of traditional, in-person lung sound assessments.
To overcome these issues, advancements in digital stethoscopes and artificial
intelligence (AI) have led to the development of new diagnostic methods. In
this context, our study aims to use smartphone microphones to record and
analyze lung sounds. We faced two major challenges: the difference in audio
style between electronic stethoscopes and smartphone microphones, and the
variability among patients. To address these challenges, we developed a method
called Patient Domain Supervised Contrastive Learning (PD-SCL). By integrating
this method with the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model, we
significantly improved its performance by 2.4\% compared to the original AST
model. This progress demonstrates that smartphones can effectively diagnose
lung sounds, addressing inconsistencies in patient data and showing potential
for broad use beyond traditional clinical settings. Our research contributes to
making lung disease detection more accessible in the post-COVID-19 world.

Result: Nosey显示更高的鼻音得分，但不同系统间的音系环境对比幅度相似。

Conclusion: Nosey是商用鼻测计的灵活经济替代方案，适合数据收集。

Abstract: We introduce Nosey (Nasalance Open Source Estimation sYstem), a low-cost,
customizable, 3D-printed system for recording acoustic nasalance data that we
have made available as open-source hardware
(http://github.com/phoneticslab/nosey). We first outline the motivations and
design principles behind our hardware nasalance system, and then present a
comparison between Nosey and a commercial nasalance device. Nosey shows
consistently higher nasalance scores than the commercial device, but the
magnitude of contrast between phonological environments is comparable between
systems. We also review ways of customizing the hardware to facilitate testing,
such as comparison of microphones and different construction materials. We
conclude that Nosey is a flexible and cost-effective alternative to commercial
nasometry devices and propose some methodological considerations for its use in
data collection.

TL;DR: MGE-LDM是一种统一的潜在扩散框架，可同时进行音乐生成、源补全和查询驱动源分离。它通过潜在空间的条件修复任务，支持对任意乐器源的灵活操作，无需依赖预定义的乐器类别。

Motivation: 该论文旨在解决现有方法局限于固定乐器类别的问题，提出一个能学习完整混音、子混音及单独音轨联合分布的框架，以支持更灵活的音乐操作。

Method: MGE-LDM利用潜在扩散模型，将分离和补全任务建模为潜在空间的条件修复，可以在异构多轨数据集上联合训练。

Result: MGE-LDM支持完整的混音生成、部分生成（源补全）和基于文本的任意源提取，且无需依赖预定义的乐器类别。

Conclusion: MGE-LDM提供了一个统一的框架，能够灵活处理音乐生成、补全和分离任务，突破了传统方法的限制。

Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous
music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike
prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a
joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within
a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1)
complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation),
and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both
separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space,
our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary
instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across
heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without
relying on predefined instrument categories. Audio samples are available at our
project page: https://yoongi43.github.io/MGELDM_Samples/.

Motivation: 当前音频深度神经网络（DNNs）虽然性能强大，但计算成本高且不可解释，因此需要更高效且可理解的替代方案。

Method: 采用频谱时域调制（STM）特征，模仿人类听觉皮层的神经生理学表示，构建分类模型。

Conclusion: STM是一种高效且可解释的音频特征表示方法，为机器听觉和语音科学的基础研究以及脑机接口和认知计算开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Audio DNNs have demonstrated impressive performance on various machine
listening tasks; however, most of their representations are computationally
costly and uninterpretable, leaving room for optimization. Here, we propose a
novel approach centered on spectrotemporal modulation (STM) features, a signal
processing method that mimics the neurophysiological representation in the
human auditory cortex. The classification performance of our STM-based model,
without any pretraining, is comparable to that of pretrained audio DNNs across
diverse naturalistic speech, music, and environmental sounds, which are
essential categories for both human cognition and machine perception. These

unlocking exciting new possibilities for basic understanding of speech and

By extending the IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) standard, we introduce local
spatial relationships and topological connections between components to enrich

long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a

in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between
solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps
surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not
necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from
classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何在图结构上基于部分线性测量估计顶点信号，结果表明平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器在严格采样条件下仍能保持弱一致性。

Motivation: 研究的目标是通过部分测量数据恢复图顶点上的潜在信号，特别是在信号平滑性假设下，探索即使采样极其稀疏时的估计性能。

Method: 使用平滑惩罚最小二乘估计器，通过最小化信号的二次变差，结合图的拓扑结构来联合恢复信号。

Result: 证明了在特定图结构下，即使极端稀疏采样（每个顶点仅测量一个坐标且采样比例趋近于零），估计器仍能保持弱一致性。

Conclusion: 平滑性假设下，即使采样极其稀疏，该方法仍能有效恢复信号，且结果可扩展到多层排名问题。

Abstract: Given an undirected and connected graph $G$ on $T$ vertices, suppose each
vertex $t$ has a latent signal $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ associated to it. Given
partial linear measurements of the signals, for a potentially small subset of
the vertices, our goal is to estimate $x_t$'s. Assuming that the signals are
smooth w.r.t $G$, in the sense that the quadratic variation of the signals over
the graph is small, we obtain non-asymptotic bounds on the mean squared error
for jointly recovering $x_t$'s, for the smoothness penalized least squares
estimator. In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this
estimator is weakly consistent (as $T \rightarrow \infty$) under potentially
very stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a
vanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a
``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths
of a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are
obtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency
is established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are
very sparse and disconnected.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing non-convex functionals on the space of
probability measures, regularized by the relative entropy (KL divergence) with
respect to a fixed reference measure, as well as the corresponding problem of
solving entropy-regularized non-convex-non-concave min-max problems. We utilize
the Best Response flow (also known in the literature as the fictitious play
flow) and study how its convergence is influenced by the relation between the
degree of non-convexity of the functional under consideration, the
regularization parameter and the tail behaviour of the reference measure. In
particular, we demonstrate how to choose the regularizer, given the non-convex
functional, so that the Best Response operator becomes a contraction with
respect to the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance, which then ensures the existence of
its unique fixed point, which is then shown to be the unique global minimizer
for our optimization problem. This extends recent results where the Best
Response flow was applied to solve convex optimization problems regularized by
the relative entropy with respect to arbitrary reference measures, and with
arbitrary values of the regularization parameter. Our results explain precisely
how the assumption of convexity can be relaxed, at the expense of making a
specific choice of the regularizer. Additionally, we demonstrate how these
results can be applied in reinforcement learning in the context of policy
optimization for Markov Decision Processes and Markov games with softmax
parametrized policies in the mean-field regime.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 该论文改进了随机洗牌梯度方法在非光滑凸优化中的收敛分析，证明了随机洗牌和单次洗牌策略比近端梯度下降更快，首次在一般凸情况下给出（近乎）最优的后缀平均收敛结果。

Motivation: 尽管随机梯度方法在实践中表现优异，但其理论理解仍有限。最近的工作在光滑凸优化中取得了最优收敛率，但在非光滑凸函数上的收敛速度仅与近端梯度下降相当。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过分析随机洗牌（RR）和单次洗牌（SS）策略，改进了非光滑（强）凸函数的最后一次迭代收敛速度。

Result: 证明了RR和SS策略在非光滑情况下比近端梯度下降更快，并在一般凸情况下给出了（近乎）最优的后缀平均收敛结果。

Conclusion: 本文填补了随机洗牌梯度方法在非光滑凸函数中的理论空白，展示了随机性的优势，并为后续研究提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We study the convergence of the shuffling gradient method, a popular
algorithm employed to minimize the finite-sum function with regularization, in
which functions are passed to apply (Proximal) Gradient Descent (GD) one by one
whose order is determined by a permutation on the indices of functions. In
contrast to its easy implementation and effective performance in practice, the
theoretical understanding remains limited. A recent advance by (Liu & Zhou,
2024b) establishes the first last-iterate convergence results under various
settings, especially proving the optimal rates for smooth (strongly) convex
optimization. However, their bounds for nonsmooth (strongly) convex functions
are only as fast as Proximal GD. In this work, we provide the first improved
last-iterate analysis for the nonsmooth case demonstrating that the widely used
Random Reshuffle ($\textsf{RR}$) and Single Shuffle ($\textsf{SS}$) strategies
are both provably faster than Proximal GD, reflecting the benefit of
randomness. As an important implication, we give the first (nearly) optimal
convergence result for the suffix average under the $\textsf{RR}$ sampling
scheme in the general convex case, matching the lower bound shown by (Koren et
al., 2022).

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线缩放梯度方法（OSGM）的理论框架，通过在线学习自适应步长以加速一阶方法，并证明了其收敛性优于固定步长。

Motivation: 研究动机在于解决传统一阶优化方法中步长选择的效率问题，尤其是在机器学习和优化任务中如何自适应调整步长以提高收敛速度。

Method: OSGM通过反馈函数量化步长的有效性，并利用在线学习算法动态调整步长，其框架能够适应不同的收敛测度。

Result: OSGM在光滑凸问题上表现出优越的收敛性，包括轨迹依赖的全局收敛、强凸问题的改进复杂度，以及局部超线性收敛，并解释了超梯度下降的实证成功。

Conclusion: OSGM不仅提供了优于固定步长的收敛保证，还构成了非渐近超线性收敛的新一族一阶方法，扩展了优化算法的理论边界。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical foundations of the online scaled
gradient methods (OSGM), a framework that utilizes online learning to adapt
stepsizes and provably accelerate first-order methods. OSGM quantifies the
effectiveness of a stepsize by a feedback function motivated from a convergence
measure and uses the feedback to adjust the stepsize through an online learning
algorithm. Consequently, instantiations of OSGM achieve convergence rates that
are asymptotically no worse than the optimal stepsize. OSGM yields desirable
convergence guarantees on smooth convex problems, including 1)
trajectory-dependent global convergence on smooth convex objectives; 2) an
improved complexity result on smooth strongly convex problems, and 3) local
superlinear convergence. Notably, OSGM constitutes a new family of first-order
methods with non-asymptotic superlinear convergence, joining the celebrated
quasi-Newton methods. Finally, OSGM explains the empirical success of the
popular hypergradient-descent heuristic in optimization for machine learning.

TL;DR: 论文质疑现有恶意软件分类器的操作可靠性，并提出AURORA框架，通过评估置信度质量和操作弹性来更全面地测试分类器性能。结果表明，现有方法在分布变化下置信度不可靠，需改进。

Motivation: 现有恶意软件分类器虽然在性能指标上表现良好，但忽视了置信度误差对齐和操作稳定性。作者旨在评估分类器在分布变化下是否保持可靠的置信度估计，并探讨科学进步与实际影响的冲突。

Method: 提出AURORA框架，通过验证模型的置信度剖面来评估其估计的可靠性，并设计了一组超越即时性能的指标，以实现更全面的操作稳定性评估。

Result: 在多种漂移强度的数据集上，现有最先进框架的脆弱性表明，需要重新设计以提高置信度可靠性和操作弹性。

Conclusion: AURORA框架为恶意软件分类器的操作可靠性提供了更全面的评估方法，揭示了现有技术的不足，并呼吁进一步改进。

Abstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear
promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The
standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics,
neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While
TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a
complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain
reliable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the
tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not.
We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their
confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence
profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its
estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste
valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and
leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. AURORA is
further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time
performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational
stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in
state-of-the-art frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests
the need for a return to the whiteboard.

TL;DR: 研究发现，AI生成内容的标签在帮助识别虚假信息方面有一定效果，但存在用户过度依赖标签的问题，且标签可能意外提高人类制作虚假信息的可信度。

Motivation: 探讨AI生成内容的标签是否能有效降低虚假信息的风险，并研究标签可能带来的副作用。

Method: 使用五个焦点小组进行定性研究，了解用户对AI标签的看法；随后进行预注册的在线调查，量化评估标签对1300多名欧美用户识别虚假信息能力的影响。

Result: 标签有助于识别AI生成的虚假信息，但可能导致用户过度依赖标签，同时意外提高了人类制作虚假信息的可信度。

Conclusion: AI标签虽有助于识别虚假信息，但需谨慎设计以避免副作用。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans'
interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to
create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed
regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only
little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated
misinformation.
  Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we
study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling.
Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the
successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users'
opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we
conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants
to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize
misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus
groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical
implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying
AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security
benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might
over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated
images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief
in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated
image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images
conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of
labels.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CaMeL通过基于能力的沙盒缓解LLM代理中的提示注入攻击，但存在信任假设、侧信道问题和性能折衷的不足。本文提出改进：提示筛选、输出审计、分层风险访问模型和验证中间语言，以增强安全性和可用性。

Motivation: 针对CaMeL现有设计中假设可信用户提示、忽略侧信道问题及双LLM设计的性能折衷，提出工程改进以扩展威胁覆盖范围和操作实用性。

Method: 采用四种方法：1）初始输入的提示筛选，2）检测指令泄漏的输出审计，3）平衡可用性与控制的分层风险访问模型，4）提供形式化保证的验证中间语言。

Result: 改进后的CaMeL更符合企业安全最佳实践，支持可扩展部署。

Conclusion: 提出的四项升级措施有效增强了CaMeL的安全性和实用性，使其更适合企业级应用。

Abstract: CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning) introduces a capability-based
sandbox to mitigate prompt injection attacks in large language model (LLM)
agents. While effective, CaMeL assumes a trusted user prompt, omits
side-channel concerns, and incurs performance tradeoffs due to its dual-LLM
design. This response identifies these issues and proposes engineering
improvements to expand CaMeL's threat coverage and operational usability. We
introduce: (1) prompt screening for initial inputs, (2) output auditing to
detect instruction leakage, (3) a tiered-risk access model to balance usability
and control, and (4) a verified intermediate language for formal guarantees.
Together, these upgrades align CaMeL with best practices in enterprise security
and support scalable deployment.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Permissioned LLMs（PermLLM）的新型LLM，通过在查询响应上叠加组织数据访问控制结构来解决企业环境中数据隔离和访问控制问题。

Motivation: 企业环境中，数据隔离和保护导致访问控制结构在LLM处理下游任务时可能失效，需要一种新方法来确保访问控制的正确实施。

Method: 提出了PermLLM机制，基于参数高效微调（Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning），并引入了相关响应和访问优势（access advantage）的形式化概念。

Result: 在四个公共数据集（GPQA、RCV1、SimpleQA和WMDP）上验证了PermLLM机制的有效性，并提出了两种量化访问控制的指标：DDI和UGI。

Conclusion: PermLLM能够有效实施访问控制，同时DDI和UGI作为量化指标是可靠的。

Abstract: In enterprise settings, organizational data is segregated, siloed and
carefully protected by elaborate access control frameworks. These access
control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed
data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate
access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs
that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query
responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to
determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query
responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can
be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We
also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate
the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM
mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired
access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access
advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership
Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility
evaluation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our PermLLM mechanisms through
extensive experiments on four public datasets (GPQA, RCV1, SimpleQA, and WMDP),
in addition to evaluating the validity of DDI and UGI metrics themselves for
quantifying access control in LLMs.

Motivation: 当前SoC安全验证方法依赖人工且缺乏灵活性，难以在RTL级别有效检测漏洞，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 开发名为BugWhisperer的框架，利用专为硬件安全微调的LLM，结合文本推理和知识迁移能力，自动化验证流程。

Result: 实验证明，定制化LLM显著提升了安全验证的效率和适应性，并建立了配套的硬件漏洞数据库。

Conclusion: BugWhisperer通过LLM技术解决了SoC安全验证的可扩展性和灵活性问题，为研究社区提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The current landscape of system-on-chips (SoCs) security verification faces
challenges due to manual, labor-intensive, and inflexible methodologies. These
issues limit the scalability and effectiveness of security protocols, making
bug detection at the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) difficult. This paper
proposes a new framework named BugWhisperer that utilizes a specialized,
fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) to address these challenges. By enhancing
the LLM's hardware security knowledge and leveraging its capabilities for text
inference and knowledge transfer, this approach automates and improves the
adaptability and reusability of the verification process. We introduce an
open-source, fine-tuned LLM specifically designed for detecting security
vulnerabilities in SoC designs. Our findings demonstrate that this tailored LLM
effectively enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the security
verification process. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive hardware
vulnerability database that supports this work and will further assist the
research community in enhancing the security verification process.

Motivation: LLM从“知识提供者”转变为“行动执行者”后，易受恶意利用，目前缺乏后训练阶段的安全对齐方法。

Method: 基于抽象行为链在模拟环境中生成安全对齐数据，兼顾真实性和复杂性，同时通过良性指令校准安全边界。

Result: 在AgentHarm评估中，显著提升开源模型的安全性（35.8%-79.5%），同时不影响或提升模型实用性。

Conclusion: AgentAlign有效解决了LLM在代理能力下的安全对齐问题，平衡了安全性与实用性。

Abstract: The acquisition of agentic capabilities has transformed LLMs from "knowledge
providers" to "action executors", a trend that while expanding LLMs' capability
boundaries, significantly increases their susceptibility to malicious use.
Previous work has shown that current LLM-based agents execute numerous
malicious tasks even without being attacked, indicating a deficiency in agentic
use safety alignment during the post-training phase. To address this gap, we
propose AgentAlign, a novel framework that leverages abstract behavior chains
as a medium for safety alignment data synthesis. By instantiating these
behavior chains in simulated environments with diverse tool instances, our
framework enables the generation of highly authentic and executable
instructions while capturing complex multi-step dynamics. The framework further
ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions
through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating
the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness. Evaluation results on
AgentHarm demonstrate that fine-tuning three families of open-source models
using our method substantially improves their safety (35.8% to 79.5%
improvement) while minimally impacting or even positively enhancing their
helpfulness, outperforming various prompting methods. The dataset and code have
both been open-sourced.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的整合提升了服务导向导航系统的感知和决策能力，但也引入了在关键任务服务流程中的安全漏洞，现有对抗攻击未能解决服务计算环境中的可靠性和服务质量需求。

Method: AdvOF通过精确聚合和对齐目标物体在2D和3D空间中的位置，定义并渲染对抗性物体，通过跨物理属性和VLM感知的协同优化，稳定处理多视图迭代融合的优化过程。

Result: 广泛评估表明，AdvOF能有效降低代理在对抗条件下的性能表现，同时对正常导航任务的干扰最小。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对VLM驱动导航系统服务安全的理解，为物理世界部署中的稳健服务组合提供了计算基础。

Abstract: We present Adversarial Object Fusion (AdvOF), a novel attack framework
targeting vision-and-language navigation (VLN) agents in service-oriented
environments by generating adversarial 3D objects. While foundational models
like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and
decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in
mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to
address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service
(QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of
adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In
particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object
positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects.
Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization
between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM
perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the
optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from
local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF
can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while
maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks. This work
advances the understanding of service security in VLM-powered navigation
systems, providing computational foundations for robust service composition in
physical-world deployments.

tracks confidentiality and integrity labels, deterministically enforces

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于贝叶斯的新视角来定义数据重构安全性，并证明在某些情况下可以防止重构攻击，同时指出指纹码攻击本质上是一种成员推理攻击而非重构攻击。

Motivation: 现有安全定义对重构攻击的防护不足，尤其是指纹码攻击（FPC）常被误认为是重构攻击，而实际上属于成员推理攻击。论文旨在澄清这一点，并提出更有效的防护方法。

Method: 论文采用贝叶斯视角重新定义数据重构，并基于此提出新的安全定义，用于分析FPC攻击的本质及其局限性。

Result: 研究证明，若目标仅是防止重构攻击而非成员推理攻击，某些基于FPC的不可能性结果不再适用。

Abstract: We introduce a new Bayesian perspective on the concept of data
reconstruction, and leverage this viewpoint to propose a new security
definition that, in certain settings, provably prevents reconstruction attacks.
We use our paradigm to shed new light on one of the most notorious attacks in
the privacy and memorization literature - fingerprinting code attacks (FPC). We
argue that these attacks are really a form of membership inference attacks,
rather than reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we show that if the goal is
solely to prevent reconstruction (but not membership inference), then in some
cases the impossibility results derived from FPC no longer apply.

Abstract: There is growing experimental evidence that $Q$-learning agents may learn to
charge supracompetitive prices. We provide the first theoretical explanation
for this behavior in infinite repeated games. Firms update their pricing
policies based solely on observed profits, without computing equilibrium
strategies. We show that when the game admits both a one-stage Nash equilibrium
price and a collusive-enabling price, and when the $Q$-function satisfies
certain inequalities at the end of experimentation, firms learn to consistently
charge supracompetitive prices. We introduce a new class of one-memory subgame
perfect equilibria (SPEs) and provide conditions under which learned behavior
is supported by naive collusion, grim trigger policies, or increasing
strategies. Naive collusion does not constitute an SPE unless the
collusive-enabling price is a one-stage Nash equilibrium, whereas grim trigger
policies can.

Abstract: This paper presents a system for autonomous semantic exploration and dense
semantic target mapping of a complex unknown environment using a ground robot
equipped with a LiDAR-panoramic camera suite. Existing approaches often
struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view
angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we
propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the
task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation.
We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel
Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This
enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without
unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to
ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive
Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while
ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic
target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM
algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our
approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and
complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner
achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a
specified number of multi-view inspections. Real-world experiments further
confirm the system's effectiveness in achieving accurate dense semantic object
mapping of unstructured environments.

Result: 通过大量实验证明，VLM-RRT在各种前沿视觉语言模型下均表现出显著效果。

Conclusion: VLM-RRT有效解决了传统方法的局限性，提升了复杂环境中路径规划的效率和适用性。

Abstract: Path planning is a fundamental capability of autonomous Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs), enabling them to efficiently navigate toward a target region
or explore complex environments while avoiding obstacles. Traditional
pathplanning methods, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), have proven
effective but often encounter significant challenges. These include high search
space complexity, suboptimal path quality, and slow convergence, issues that
are particularly problematic in high-stakes applications like disaster
response, where rapid and efficient planning is critical. To address these
limitations and enhance path-planning efficiency, we propose Vision Language
Model RRT (VLM-RRT), a hybrid approach that integrates the pattern recognition
capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the path-planning strengths
of RRT. By leveraging VLMs to provide initial directional guidance based on
environmental snapshots, our method biases sampling toward regions more likely
to contain feasible paths, significantly improving sampling efficiency and path
quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments with various
state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed approach.

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和认知护栏的方法提升了sUAS群在复杂环境中的自主决策能力，并确保其决策的安全性和合理性。

Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous
swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these
settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and
autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often
struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer
their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large
language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications.
While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations
and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure
safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must
be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design,
simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in
search-and-rescue missions.

Conclusion: 该研究为越野环境中的异常检测提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In order to navigate safely and reliably in off-road and unstructured
environments, robots must detect anomalies that are out-of-distribution (OOD)
with respect to the training data. We present an analysis-by-synthesis approach
for pixel-wise anomaly detection without making any assumptions about the
nature of OOD data. Given an input image, we use a generative diffusion model
to synthesize an edited image that removes anomalies while keeping the
remaining image unchanged. Then, we formulate anomaly detection as analyzing
which image segments were modified by the diffusion model. We propose a novel
inference approach for guided diffusion by analyzing the ideal guidance
gradient and deriving a principled approximation that bootstraps the diffusion
model to predict guidance gradients. Our editing technique is purely test-time
that can be integrated into existing workflows without the need for retraining
or fine-tuning. Finally, we use a combination of vision-language foundation
models to compare pixels in a learned feature space and detect semantically
meaningful edits, enabling accurate anomaly detection for off-road navigation.

Abstract: Coordinating the motion between lower and upper limbs and aligning limb
control with perception are substantial challenges in robotics, particularly in
dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged
mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise
coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified
reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills
involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and
striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes
real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between
simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors.
Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement
learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification
techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a
variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock
trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise
strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged
mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.

Conclusion: 策略移动化通过优化基座位姿解决了视觉运动策略的泛化问题，且与现有提升策略鲁棒性的方法兼容，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.

Motivation: 非绝热耦合（NAC）在光化学和光物理过程的模拟中至关重要，但传统方法学习NAC面临向量性、双值性和锥形交叉点附近奇异性的挑战。

Method: 基于领域知识设计了NAC特定描述符，并提出新的机器学习相位校正方法，结合FSSH模拟实现高效计算。

Result: 在fulvene的SA-2-CASSCF(6,6)电子结构水平上，ML-FSSH动力学模拟准确描述了S₁衰减，且通过大量轨迹降低了误差。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了NAC机器学习精度，为光化学模拟提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Nonadiabatic couplings (NACs) play a crucial role in modeling photochemical
and photophysical processes with methods such as the widely used
fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH). There is therefore a strong incentive
to machine learn NACs for accelerating simulations. However, this is
challenging due to NACs' vectorial, double-valued character and the singularity
near a conical intersection seam. For the first time, we design NAC-specific
descriptors based on our domain expertise and show that they allow learning
NACs with never-before-reported accuracy of $R^2$ exceeding 0.99. The key to
success is also our new ML phase-correction procedure. We demonstrate the
efficiency and robustness of our approach on a prototypical example of fully
ML-driven FSSH simulations of fulvene targeting the SA-2-CASSCF(6,6) electronic
structure level. This ML-FSSH dynamics leads to an accurate description of
$S_1$ decay while reducing error bars by allowing the execution of a large
ensemble of trajectories. Our implementations are available in open-source
MLatom.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种新颖的Siamese架构方法，利用限价订单簿（LOB）数据的对称性，结合多头注意力机制提升深度学习模型在股票价格预测中的表现，实验证明其有效性。

Motivation: 由于原始LOB数据高维且波动性强，现有深度学习模型难以有效捕捉价格变动模式，而数据的对称性和稳定性为改进模型提供了新的思路。

Method: 采用Siamese架构分别处理订单簿的买卖两侧，结合多头注意力机制（MHA）和LSTM模块，并在多种基线模型上进行验证。

Result: 该方法在75%以上的案例中提升了基线模型性能，且多头注意力机制在短期预测中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: Siamese架构和多头注意力机制的结合有效提升了限价订单簿数据建模的性能。

Abstract: In high-frequency trading (HFT), leveraging limit order books (LOB) to model
stock price movements is crucial for achieving profitable outcomes. However,
this task is challenging due to the high-dimensional and volatile nature of the
original data. Even recent deep learning models often struggle to capture price
movement patterns effectively, particularly without well-designed features. We
observed that raw LOB data exhibits inherent symmetry between the ask and bid
sides, and the bid-ask differences demonstrate greater stability and lower
complexity compared to the original data. Building on this insight, we propose
a novel approach in which leverages the Siamese architecture to enhance the
performance of existing deep learning models. The core idea involves processing
the ask and bid sides separately using the same module with shared parameters.
We applied our Siamese-based methods to several widely used strong baselines
and validated their effectiveness using data from 14 military industry stocks
in the Chinese A-share market. Furthermore, we integrated multi-head attention
(MHA) mechanisms with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to investigate
its role in modeling stock price movements. Our experiments used raw data and
widely used Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) features as input with some strong
baseline models. The results show that our method improves the performance of
strong baselines in over 75$% of cases, excluding the Multi-Layer Perception
(MLP) baseline, which performed poorly and is not considered practical.
Furthermore, we found that Multi-Head Attention can enhance model performance,
particularly over shorter forecasting horizons.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决具有静态非线性反馈的Lur'e型非线性系统的局部稳定性问题，特别是在使用前馈神经网络（FFNNs）实现非线性反馈时，如何有效估计吸引区域（ROA）。

Method: 论文采用了两种方法：一是基于Lyapunov函数的方法，通过构造满足线性矩阵不等式（LMI）的二次函数的子水平集；二是通过逐层传播线性松弛计算FFNNs的紧局部扇区边界，并将其整合到局部Aizerman框架中。

Result: 数值结果显示了两种方法的有效性，显著优于现有的积分二次约束（IQC）方法，尤其是在ROA大小和可扩展性方面表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: 论文的结论表明，提出的两种方法能够有效估计非线性系统的吸引区域，并且在FFNNs实现非线性反馈的情况下提升了局部稳定性的验证能力。

Abstract: We study the local stability of nonlinear systems in the Lur'e form with
static nonlinear feedback realized by feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). By
leveraging positivity system constraints, we employ a localized variant of the
Aizerman conjecture, which provides sufficient conditions for exponential
stability of trajectories confined to a compact set. Using this foundation, we
develop two distinct methods for estimating the Region of Attraction (ROA): (i)
a less conservative Lyapunov-based approach that constructs invariant sublevel
sets of a quadratic function satisfying a linear matrix inequality (LMI), and
(ii) a novel technique for computing tight local sector bounds for FFNNs via
layer-wise propagation of linear relaxations. These bounds are integrated into
the localized Aizerman framework to certify local exponential stability.
Numerical results demonstrate substantial improvements over existing integral
quadratic constraint-based approaches in both ROA size and scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了用户中心的V2G优化，平衡了经济收益与电池健康，同时证明了ICNN在复杂非线性关系建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven, user-centric vehicle-to-grid (V2G) methodology
based on multi-objective optimization to balance battery degradation and V2G
revenue according to EV user preference. Given the lack of accurate and
generalizable battery degradation models, we leverage input convex neural
networks (ICNNs) to develop a data-driven degradation model trained on
extensive experimental datasets. This approach enables our model to capture
nonconvex dependencies on battery temperature and time while maintaining
convexity with respect to the charging rate. Such a partial convexity property
ensures that the second stage of our methodology remains computationally
efficient. In the second stage, we integrate our data-driven degradation model
into a multi-objective optimization framework to generate an optimal smart
charging profile for each EV. This profile effectively balances the trade-off
between financial benefits from V2G participation and battery degradation,
controlled by a hyperparameter reflecting the user prioritization of battery
health. Numerical simulations show the high accuracy of the ICNN model in
predicting battery degradation for unseen data. Finally, we present a trade-off
curve illustrating financial benefits from V2G versus losses from battery
health degradation based on user preferences and showcase smart charging
strategies under realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework in generative modeling,

TL;DR: StarBASE-GP是一种基于遗传编程的多目标优化工具，用于高效识别基因组数据中与表型相关的变异。

Motivation: 解决大规模基因组数据中复杂性状相关变异的自动化发现难题，并整合生物学知识以提高准确性。

Method: 采用遗传编程多目标优化策略，结合多种生物学领域知识（如遗传编码策略、连锁不平衡修剪）和动态变异推荐系统。

Result: 在褐家鼠群体中表现优于随机基准和生物学无知版本，能更准确地识别已知和新数量性状位点。

Conclusion: StarBASE-GP结合进化搜索与生物学理论，展示了在复杂性状变异发现中的强大潜力。

Abstract: We present the Star-Based Automated Single-locus and Epistasis analysis tool
- Genetic Programming (StarBASE-GP), an automated framework for discovering
meaningful genetic variants associated with phenotypic variation in large-scale
genomic datasets. StarBASE-GP uses a genetic programming-based multi-objective
optimization strategy to evolve machine learning pipelines that simultaneously
maximize explanatory power (r2) and minimize pipeline complexity. Biological
domain knowledge is integrated at multiple stages, including the use of nine
inheritance encoding strategies to model deviations from additivity, a custom
linkage disequilibrium pruning node that minimizes redundancy among features,
and a dynamic variant recommendation system that prioritizes informative
candidates for pipeline inclusion. We evaluate StarBASE-GP on a cohort of
Rattus norvegicus (brown rat) to identify variants associated with body mass
index, benchmarking its performance against a random baseline and a
biologically naive version of the tool. StarBASE-GP consistently evolves Pareto
fronts with superior performance, yielding higher accuracy in identifying both
ground truth and novel quantitative trait loci, highlighting relevant targets
for future validation. By incorporating evolutionary search and relevant
biological theory into a flexible automated machine learning framework,
StarBASE-GP demonstrates robust potential for advancing variant discovery in
complex traits.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: TailorSQL 是一种利用历史查询负载信息的 NL2SQL 系统，通过改进自然语言到 SQL 的翻译准确性和延迟，实现了标准化基准上执行准确性的显著提升。

Motivation: 现有的 NL2SQL 技术通常忽略了真实场景中已有的历史查询负载信息，这些信息对于提高翻译的准确性和效率具有潜在价值。

Method: TailorSQL 通过利用历史查询负载中的信息（如常见连接路径和表列名的语义）来优化翻译过程，而不只是依赖于数据库模式。

Result: TailorSQL 在标准化基准测试中实现了执行准确性高达 2 倍的提升。

Conclusion: 利用历史查询负载信息可以显著提升 NL2SQL 系统的性能，尤其是针对特定工作负载时。

Abstract: NL2SQL (natural language to SQL) translates natural language questions into
SQL queries, thereby making structured data accessible to non-technical users,
serving as the foundation for intelligent data applications. State-of-the-art
NL2SQL techniques typically perform translation by retrieving database-specific
information, such as the database schema, and invoking a pre-trained large
language model (LLM) using the question and retrieved information to generate
the SQL query.
  However, existing NL2SQL techniques miss a key opportunity which is present
in real-world settings: NL2SQL is typically applied on existing databases which
have already served many SQL queries in the past. The past query workload
implicitly contains information which is helpful for accurate NL2SQL
translation and is not apparent from the database schema alone, such as common
join paths and the semantics of obscurely-named tables and columns. We
introduce TailorSQL, a NL2SQL system that takes advantage of information in the
past query workload to improve both the accuracy and latency of translating
natural language questions into SQL. By specializing to a given workload,
TailorSQL achieves up to 2$\times$ improvement in execution accuracy on
standardized benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper offers a hybrid explainable temporal data processing pipeline,
DataFul Explainable MultivariatE coRrelatIonal Temporal Artificial inTElligence
(EMeriTAte+DF), bridging numerical-driven temporal data classification with an
event-based one through verified artificial intelligence principles, enabling
human-explainable results. This was possible through a preliminary a posteriori
explainable phase describing the numerical input data in terms of concurrent
constituents with numerical payloads. This further required extending the
event-based literature to design specification mining algorithms supporting
concurrent constituents. Our previous and current solutions outperform
state-of-the-art solutions for multivariate time series classifications, thus
showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: KVzip是一种查询无关的KV缓存驱逐方法，通过压缩和重用KV缓存减少内存开销和注意力延迟，性能损失可忽略。

Motivation: 随着上下文长度增加，基于Transformer的大语言模型（LLM）的KV缓存占用大量内存，导致延迟增加，现有查询感知方法在多查询场景下性能下降。

Method: KVzip通过LLM量化KV对的重要性，重构原始上下文并驱逐低重要性缓存，实现查询无关的高效压缩。

Result: 实验表明KVzip将KV缓存大小减少3-4倍，FlashAttention解码延迟降低约2倍，在问答、检索等任务中性能损失可忽略。

Conclusion: KVzip在长上下文和多查询场景中显著优于现有方法，验证了其高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) cache context as key-value
(KV) pairs during inference. As context length grows, KV cache sizes expand,
leading to substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency. This
paper introduces KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method enabling
effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries. KVzip
quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct
original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower
importance. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV
cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately
2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval,
reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models
such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching
up to 170K tokens. KVzip significantly outperforms existing query-aware KV
eviction methods, which suffer from performance degradation even at a 90% cache
budget ratio under multi-query scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出一个名为CONTEXT-ALIGN的框架，用于评估人工智能（AI）对话代理对人类交流规范的适配程度，并指出当前大型语言模型（LLM）在这方面的根本性限制。

Motivation: 探讨AI对话代理如何更好地遵循人类交流规范，尤其是处理上下文和共有知识的能力，从而提升对话质量。

Method: 基于哲学和语言学中的对话语用学理论，提出CONTEXT-ALIGN框架，分析LLM架构对实现对话对齐的潜在限制。

Result: 当前LLM在完全实现对话对齐上存在根本性限制，需更深入的设计改进。

Conclusion: CONTEXT-ALIGN框架为AI对话代理的设计提供了新的评估标准，但需进一步研究以突破现有技术限制。

Abstract: The development of sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) conversational
agents based on large language models raises important questions about the
relationship between human norms, values, and practices and AI design and
performance. This article explores what it means for AI agents to be
conversationally aligned to human communicative norms and practices for
handling context and common ground and proposes a new framework for evaluating
developers' design choices. We begin by drawing on the philosophical and
linguistic literature on conversational pragmatics to motivate a set of
desiderata, which we call the CONTEXT-ALIGN framework, for conversational
alignment with human communicative practices. We then suggest that current
large language model (LLM) architectures, constraints, and affordances may
impose fundamental limitations on achieving full conversational alignment.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement and democratization of generative AI
models have sparked significant debate over safety, ethical risks, and dual-use
concerns, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. While anecdotally
known, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding generative AI's
association with malicious internet-related activities and cybercrime by
examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological
amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with
interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one
cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in
cybercrime. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about AI governance
by balancing control and fostering innovation, underscoring the need for
strategies to guide policymakers, inform AI developers and cybersecurity
professionals, and educate the public to maximize AI's benefits while

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了分布式联邦学习（DFL）在车联网中用于安全消息分类的效果，相比传统方法的局限性，DFL显著提高了分类准确率并增强了知识共享，但也揭示了其在多域攻击下的脆弱性。

Motivation: 解决车联网中因规模大、高移动性和异构数据分布导致的集中式或纯本地学习方法局限性问题。

Method: 采用分布式联邦学习（DFL），车辆通过一跳邻居交换模型更新并在多跳中传播模型进行协作训练。

Result: DFL显著提升了所有车辆的分类准确率，尤其是低准确率车辆；同时揭示了数据大小和网络动态性对模型性能的影响及其在多域攻击下的脆弱性。

Conclusion: DFL在车联网中表现出优越性能，但需进一步研究更鲁棒的策略以应对多域攻击。

Abstract: In connected and autonomous vehicles, machine learning for safety message
classification has become critical for detecting malicious or anomalous
behavior. However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data
collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale,
high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle
networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed
Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning
models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating
models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi)
Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification
accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data.
Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains
through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network.
We further show that local training data size and time-varying network
connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We
investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple
domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our
results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when
confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust
strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.

Motivation: 解决k近邻算法在面对大量数据时的时间复杂度瓶颈问题，提升算法效率。

Method: 使用粒度球预处理减少数据规模，采用HNSW方法加速搜索，并通过量子化优化距离计算等耗时步骤。

Result: 算法显著降低了kNN类算法的时间复杂度。

Conclusion: GB-QkNN通过粒度球和量子化HNSW方法的结合，有效提升了kNN算法的效率。

Abstract: High time complexity is one of the biggest challenges faced by $k$-Nearest
Neighbors ($k$NN). Although current classical and quantum $k$NN algorithms have
made some improvements, they still have a speed bottleneck when facing large
amounts of data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm
called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN). This approach achieves
higher efficiency by first employing granular-balls, which reduces the data
size needed to processed. The search process is then accelerated by adopting a
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the
time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via
quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search
process. By combining the use of granular-balls and quantization of the HNSW
method, our approach manages to take advantage of these treatments and
significantly reduces the time complexity of the $k$NN-like algorithms, as
revealed by a comprehensive complexity analysis.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了量子学习领域中低阶方法工具的空白，为量子态学习的计算困难性提供了理论依据。

Abstract: In a variety of physically relevant settings for learning from quantum data,
designing protocols that can computationally efficiently extract information
remains largely an art, and there are important cases where we believe this to
be impossible, that is, where there is an information-computation gap. While
there is a large array of tools in the classical literature for giving evidence
for average-case hardness of statistical inference problems, the corresponding
tools in the quantum literature are far more limited. One such framework in the
classical literature, the low-degree method, makes predictions about hardness
of inference problems based on the failure of estimators given by low-degree
polynomials. In this work, we extend this framework to the quantum setting.
  We establish a general connection between state designs and low-degree
hardness. We use this to obtain the first information-computation gaps for
learning Gibbs states of random, sparse, non-local Hamiltonians. We also use it
to prove hardness for learning random shallow quantum circuit states in a
challenging model where states can be measured in adaptively chosen bases. To
our knowledge, the ability to model adaptivity within the low-degree framework
was open even in classical settings. In addition, we also obtain a low-degree
hardness result for quantum error mitigation against strategies with
single-qubit measurements.
  We define a new quantum generalization of the planted biclique problem and
identify the threshold at which this problem becomes computationally hard for
protocols that perform local measurements. Interestingly, the complexity
landscape for this problem shifts when going from local measurements to more
entangled single-copy measurements.
  We show average-case hardness for the "standard" variant of Learning
Stabilizers with Noise and for agnostically learning product states.

Result: 在量子磁力测量任务中验证了动态VQS方法的可靠性，同时保持了估计精度。

Conclusion: 动态VQS与在线共形推断结合，为NISQ设备上的可靠量子传感提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum sensing exploits non-classical effects to overcome limitations of
classical sensors, with applications ranging from gravitational-wave detection
to nanoscale imaging. However, practical quantum sensors built on noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices face significant noise and sampling
constraints, and current variational quantum sensing (VQS) methods lack
rigorous performance guarantees. This paper proposes an online control
framework for VQS that dynamically updates the variational parameters while
providing deterministic error bars on the estimates. By leveraging online
conformal inference techniques, the approach produces sequential estimation
sets with a guaranteed long-term risk level. Experiments on a quantum
magnetometry task confirm that the proposed dynamic VQS approach maintains the
required reliability over time, while still yielding precise estimates. The
results demonstrate the practical benefits of combining variational quantum
algorithms with online conformal inference to achieve reliable quantum sensing
on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Manufacturing environments are becoming more complex and unpredictable due to
factors such as demand variations and shorter product lifespans. This
complexity requires real-time decision-making and adaptation to disruptions.
Traditional control approaches highlight the need for advanced control
strategies capable of overcoming unforeseen challenges, as they demonstrate
limitations in responsiveness within dynamic industrial settings. Multi-agent
systems address these challenges through decentralization of decision-making,
enabling systems to respond dynamically to operational changes. However,
current multi-agent systems encounter challenges related to real-time
adaptation, context-aware decision-making, and the dynamic exploration of
resource capabilities. Large language models provide the possibility to
overcome these limitations through context-aware decision-making capabilities.
This paper introduces a large language model-enabled control architecture for
multi-agent manufacturing systems to dynamically explore resource capabilities
in response to real-time disruptions. A simulation-based case study
demonstrates that the proposed architecture improves system resilience and
flexibility. The case study findings show improved throughput and efficient
resource utilization compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 适度稀疏的拓扑能最佳平衡错误抑制与信息传播，EIB-leanrner验证了这一设计原则的有效性。

Abstract: The communication topology in large language model-based multi-agent systems
fundamentally governs inter-agent collaboration patterns, critically shaping
both the efficiency and effectiveness of collective decision-making. While
recent studies for communication topology automated design tend to construct
sparse structures for efficiency, they often overlook why and when sparse and
dense topologies help or hinder collaboration. In this paper, we present a
causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous,
propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal
that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation
while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal
task performance. Guided by this insight, we propose a novel topology design
approach, EIB-leanrner, that balances error suppression and beneficial
information propagation by fusing connectivity patterns from both dense and
sparse graphs. Extensive experiments show the superior effectiveness,
communication cost, and robustness of EIB-leanrner.

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely,
cost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative
logistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized
multi-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a
fleet of $\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\mathcal{K}$ robots,
cooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the
launching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby
addressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited
range, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic
features: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3)
flexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic
and acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5)
en-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being
transported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle
transit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)
to minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational
challenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm,
FINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to
provide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various
instance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in
terms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate
significant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode
and substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also
provides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility,
drone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.

TL;DR: 论文引入了$k$-DTW，一种新的多边形曲线差异度量方法，比DTW更具度量特性且比Fr&#xe9;chet距离更能抵抗异常值，提供了精确和近似算法，并在理论和实验上展示了其优势。

Motivation: 为解决现有差异度量方法（如DTW和Frechet距离）在鲁棒性和计算效率上的不足，提出更具适应性和性能的$k$-DTW度量方法。

Method: 提出$k$-DTW算法，包括精确算法和$(1+/epsilon)$-近似算法，通过参数搜索处理$k$最大匹配距离，并获得维度无关的学习边界。

Result: $k$-DTW在曲线学习中样本量更小，Rademacher和Gaussian复杂度严格低于DTW，因子为$/tildeOmega(/sqrt{m})$，实验验证了其在聚类和分类中的优势。

Conclusion: $k$-DTW在多边形曲线差异度量中表现出优越的理论和实际性能，尤其在计算效率和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces $k$-Dynamic Time Warping ($k$-DTW), a novel
dissimilarity measure for polygonal curves. $k$-DTW has stronger metric
properties than Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and is more robust to outliers than
the Fr\'{e}chet distance, which are the two gold standards of dissimilarity
measures for polygonal curves. We show interesting properties of $k$-DTW and
give an exact algorithm as well as a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for $k$-DTW by a parametric search for the $k$-th largest matched distance. We
prove the first dimension-free learning bounds for curves and further learning
theoretic results. $k$-DTW not only admits smaller sample size than DTW for the
problem of learning the median of curves, where some factors depending on the
curves' complexity $m$ are replaced by $k$, but we also show a surprising
separation on the associated Rademacher and Gaussian complexities: $k$-DTW
admits strictly smaller bounds than DTW, by a factor $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m})$
when $k\ll m$. We complement our theoretical findings with an experimental
illustration of the benefits of using $k$-DTW for clustering and nearest
neighbor classification.

Conclusion: 总结了LLM推荐系统的开放挑战和未来研究方向，为下一代推荐系统提供指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms for recommender
systems by enabling richer semantic understanding and incorporating implicit
world knowledge. In this study, we propose a systematic taxonomy that
classifies existing approaches into two categories: (1) Pure LLM Recommenders,
which rely solely on LLMs, and (2) Augmented LLM Recommenders, which integrate
additional non-LLM techniques to enhance performance. This taxonomy provides a
novel lens through which to examine the evolving landscape of LLM-based
recommendation. To support fair comparison, we introduce a unified evaluation
platform that benchmarks representative models under consistent experimental
settings, highlighting key design choices that impact effectiveness. We
conclude by discussing open challenges and outlining promising directions for
future research. This work offers both a comprehensive overview and practical
guidance for advancing next-generation LLM-powered recommender.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了State Machine Reasoning (SMR)方法，解决了Chain-of-Thought (CoT)推理中过度思考和语义冗余的问题，在信息检索任务中提升了性能并减少了资源消耗。

Motivation: 针对Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在信息检索中导致的过度思考和冗余轨迹问题，作者旨在提出一种更高效且可控的推理框架。

Method: 作者提出了State Machine Reasoning (SMR)，一个基于离散动作（Refine、Rerank、Stop）的过渡推理框架，支持早期停止和细粒度控制。

Result: 在BEIR和BRIGHT基准测试中，SMR将检索性能（nDCG@10）提高了3.4%，同时减少了74.4%的令牌使用量。

Conclusion: SMR是一种无需任务特定调优的通用方法，为传统CoT推理提供了实用替代方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However,
it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and
semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key
challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and
misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we
propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework
composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping
and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show
that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token
usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring
task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT
reasoning. The code and details are available at https://github.com/ldilab/SMR.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合检索方法，结合了词法精确匹配、语义泛化和深度上下文重排序，用于为社交媒体帖子检索相关科学文献。该方法在开发集和测试集上表现优异，排名靠前。

Motivation: 解决社交媒体帖子与科学文献之间非正式到正式语言的检索鸿沟，提升检索效果。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计和微调的本地开源模型检索流程，无需外部训练数据即可实现高效检索。

Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the Deep Retrieval team for subtask
4b of the CLEF CheckThat! 2025 competition, which focuses on retrieving
relevant scientific literature for given social media posts. To address this
task, we propose a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines lexical precision,
semantic generalization, and deep contextual re-ranking, enabling robust
retrieval that bridges the informal-to-formal language gap. Specifically, we
combine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a
fine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns
the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are
then merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.
  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the
development set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on
the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31
teams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to
the top-ranked system. We achieve this strong performance by running
open-source models locally and without external training data, highlighting the
effectiveness of a carefully designed and fine-tuned retrieval pipeline.

Conclusion: 该研究为推荐系统提供了超越准确性的新方向，旨在通过惊喜感提升用户满意度。

Abstract: A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when
guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For
example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be
both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper
crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical
for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion
for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the
new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with
atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts
atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their
user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to
rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system
development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are
manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially
generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect
utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic
selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based
judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that
serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with
ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual
annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we
hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in
this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go
beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.

Abstract: Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and
tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging
plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment.
While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood
flow in the brain, the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic
reactions and adverse side effects, along with costing USD 4.9 billion
worldwide in 2022. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep
learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT
perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial
intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We
demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological
characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated
using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and
demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A
double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced
neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's
visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared
to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall,
MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering
contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIAS-SAM is a novel method for medical image anomaly segmentation using a patch-based memory bank and SAM encoder. It avoids thresholding and shows high accuracy across multiple datasets.

Motivation: To improve anomaly segmentation in medical images by leveraging a memory bank of normal features and eliminating the need for threshold selection.

Method: Uses a SAM encoder to extract features from normal data, stores them in a patch-based memory bank, compares test embeddings to generate anomaly maps, and computes their center of gravity to prompt SAM decoder for segmentation.

Result: Demonstrates accurate anomaly segmentation on Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT datasets, measured via DICE score.

Conclusion: MIAS-SAM effectively segments anomalies without thresholding, achieving robust performance across diverse medical imaging modalities.

Abstract: This paper presents MIAS-SAM, a novel approach for the segmentation of
anomalous regions in medical images. MIAS-SAM uses a patch-based memory bank to
store relevant image features, which are extracted from normal data using the
SAM encoder. At inference time, the embedding patches extracted from the SAM
encoder are compared with those in the memory bank to obtain the anomaly map.
Finally, MIAS-SAM computes the center of gravity of the anomaly map to prompt
the SAM decoder, obtaining an accurate segmentation from the previously
extracted features. Differently from prior works, MIAS-SAM does not require to
define a threshold value to obtain the segmentation from the anomaly map.
Experimental results conducted on three publicly available datasets, each with
a different imaging modality (Brain MRI, Liver CT, and Retina OCT) show
accurate anomaly segmentation capabilities measured using DICE score. The code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIMTS是一个基于视觉MAE的框架，用于处理不规则多变量时间序列预测，通过特征补全和自监督学习提升性能。

Motivation: 由于多通道信号未对齐和大量缺失数据，现有的不规则多变量时间序列预测方法难以捕获可靠的时序模式，而现有的预训练基础模型仅适用于规则采样时序数据，因此需要一种新方法。

Method: VIMTS将不规则时间序列分割为等间隔特征块，利用学习到的跨通道依赖补全缺失数据，并借助视觉MAE处理稀疏多通道数据的能力进行块重构，再通过粗到细的技术生成预测。同时结合自监督学习优化建模。

Result: 实验表明VIMTS在性能和少样本学习能力上表现优异，推动了视觉基础模型在更广泛时序任务中的应用。

Conclusion: VIMTS通过结合视觉MAE和自监督学习，有效解决了不规则多变量时间序列预测的挑战，并在实验中取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) forecasting is challenging due to
the unaligned nature of multi-channel signals and the prevalence of extensive
missing data. Existing methods struggle to capture reliable temporal patterns
from such data due to significant missing values. While pre-trained foundation
models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically
designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS). Motivated by the visual Mask
AutoEncoder's (MAE) powerful capability for modeling sparse multi-channel
information and its success in RTS forecasting, we propose VIMTS, a framework
adapting Visual MAE for IMTS forecasting. To mitigate the effect of missing
values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at
equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned
cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in
handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a
coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.
In addition, we integrate self-supervised learning for improved IMTS modeling
by adapting the visual MAE to IMTS data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
VIMTS's superior performance and few-shot capability, advancing the application
of visual foundation models in more general time series tasks. Our code is
available at https://github.com/WHU-HZY/VIMTS.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that
seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and
fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior
methods that address these motion types through separate modules or
task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting
user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video
generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify
keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire
object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected
trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally
consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework
demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks,
including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint
changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our
method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality
compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly
compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones. Project

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏对空间一致性的明确要求，大多数基准测试仅关注视觉一致性或生成质量，忽视长期空间一致性。

Method: 通过在Minecraft开放世界中采样150个不同位置，收集250小时（2000万帧）的循环导航视频数据，并采用课程设计逐步增加序列长度。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试填补了空间一致性研究的空白，为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.

Abstract: Modern VLMs have achieved near-saturation accuracy in English document visual
question-answering (VQA). However, this task remains challenging in lower
resource languages due to a dearth of suitable training and evaluation data. In
this paper we present scalable methods for curating such datasets by focusing
on Hungarian, approximately the 17th highest resource language on the internet.
Specifically, we present HuDocVQA and HuDocVQA-manual, document VQA datasets
that modern VLMs significantly underperform on compared to English DocVQA.
HuDocVQA-manual is a small manually curated dataset based on Hungarian
documents from Common Crawl, while HuDocVQA is a larger synthetically generated
VQA data set from the same source. We apply multiple rounds of quality
filtering and deduplication to HuDocVQA in order to match human-level quality
in this dataset. We also present HuCCPDF, a dataset of 117k pages from
Hungarian Common Crawl PDFs along with their transcriptions, which can be used
for training a model for Hungarian OCR. To validate the quality of our
datasets, we show how finetuning on a mixture of these datasets can improve
accuracy on HuDocVQA for Llama 3.2 11B Instruct by +7.2%. Our datasets and code
will be released to the public to foster further research in multilingual

Abstract: Recent advancements in unified vision-language models (VLMs), which integrate
both visual understanding and generation capabilities, have attracted
significant attention. The underlying hypothesis is that a unified architecture
with mixed training on both understanding and generation tasks can enable
mutual enhancement between understanding and generation. However, this
hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address
this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across
understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a
dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive
experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM
architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First,
unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding
and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can
scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input
and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge
acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this
cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond
modality adapters. Our findings underscore the critical necessity of unifying
understanding and generation in VLMs, offering valuable insights for the design
and optimization of unified VLMs.

Abstract: Compositional generalization is the ability of generalizing novel
compositions from seen primitives, and has received much attention in
vision-and-language (V\&L) recently. Due to the multi-modal nature of V\&L
tasks, the primitives composing compositions source from different modalities,
resulting in multi-sourced novel compositions. However, the generalization
ability over multi-sourced novel compositions, \textit{i.e.}, multi-sourced
compositional generalization (MSCG) remains unexplored. In this paper, we
explore MSCG in the context of visual question answering (VQA), and propose a
retrieval-augmented training framework to enhance the MSCG ability of VQA
models by learning unified representations for primitives from different
modalities. Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for
each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are
aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps
the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives
across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we
construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples
include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different
modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework. We release GQA-MSCG at https://github.com/NeverMoreLCH/MSCG.

TL;DR: GeoMan是一种新颖的架构，通过将视频几何估计任务重构为图像到视频生成问题，解决了现有方法在单图像优化中难以保持时间一致性和细节捕捉的局限性。

Motivation: 现有方法在从单图像优化时，往往无法保持时间一致性且难以捕捉细粒度的动态细节，因此需要一种新的方法来提升3D人体几何估计的准确性和时间一致性。

Method: GeoMan采用基于图像的模型估计首帧深度和法线，随后通过视频扩散模型细化，并结合根相对深度表示以保留人体尺寸细节。

Conclusion: GeoMan通过创新设计克服了传统方法在4D数据稀缺和人体尺寸估计方面的局限性，为视频中的3D人体几何估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and temporally consistent 3D human geometry from videos
is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods, primarily
optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and
fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we
present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and
temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.
GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training
data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.
To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to
estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then
conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as
an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of
geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role
to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video
datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and
generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the
challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth
representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be
estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional
affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D
human geometry estimation from videos.

Method: 基于EEG基础模型进行适配改造，提出EAD框架，学习鲁棒的EEG表征，支持不同通道数的数据分类任务。

Result: 在EEG-ImageNet和BrainLat数据集上分别达到99.33%和92.31%的准确率，验证了其在刺激和静息态EEG任务中的有效性及零样本分类泛化能力。

Conclusion: EAD框架为多设备EEG数据分类提供了统一解决方案，具有较强的通用性和泛化性能。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) has been a popular modality for neural
decoding, it often involves task specific acquisition of the EEG data. This
poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings
for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various
decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal
preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly
dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same
pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same
experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the
development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly
beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with
varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a
flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More
specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant
adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the
classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets
achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and
BrainLat respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed
framework across diverse EEG datasets containing two different perception
tasks: stimulus and resting-state EEG signals. We also perform zero-shot EEG
classification on EEG-ImageNet task to demonstrate the generalization
capability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了名为{Zero-to-Hero}的参考视频编辑方法，通过解耦编辑过程为锚帧编辑和一致性传播，并利用注意力机制和生成模型提升效果，PSNR提高了2.6 dB。

Motivation: 解决文本引导视频编辑中用户意图不明确和细粒度控制不足的问题。

Result: 在PSNR上比最佳基线方法提高了2.6 dB，实现了高精度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的{Zero-to-Hero}方法在视频编辑中实现了用户意图明确和细粒度控制，效果显著。

Abstract: Appearance editing according to user needs is a pivotal task in video
editing. Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user
intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of
objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach
named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that
disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this
by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference
image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We
leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention
mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or
temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when
dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot
initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However,
intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging
degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues. Starting
from Zero-Stage, our Hero-Stage Holistically learns a conditional generative
model for vidEo RestOration. To accurately evaluate the consistency of the
appearance, we construct a set of videos with multiple appearances using
Blender, enabling a fine-grained and deterministic evaluation. Our method
outperforms the best-performing baseline with a PSNR improvement of 2.6 dB. The

TL;DR: FlowAlign通过引入流匹配损失作为正则化机制，解决了FlowEdit等无反转流编辑方法中轨迹不稳定和源一致性差的问题，显著提升了编辑效果。

Motivation: 针对FlowEdit等无反转流编辑方法在轨迹控制和源一致性上的不足，FlowAlign旨在提供一种更稳定、一致的图像编辑框架。

Method: FlowAlign采用流匹配损失作为正则化机制，平衡语义对齐与结构一致性，同时支持反向编辑。

Result: 实验证明，FlowAlign在源保持和编辑可控性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FlowAlign为无反转流编辑提供了一种可逆、一致且可控的新框架。

Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit
leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3,
enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation
(ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these
methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source
consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel
inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with
principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a
regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories
during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to
explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural
consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign
naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory,
highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods
in both source preservation and editing controllability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需解码器、训练或微调的CLIP单独图像合成方法，通过优化频率感知的隐式神经表示实现生成。

Motivation: 探索判别式模型（如CLIP）潜在的生成能力，揭示其隐藏的生成潜力。

Method: 采用频率感知隐式神经表示，结合对抗性鲁棒初始化、正交投影和混合损失，实现图像合成。

Result: 成功实现文本到图像生成、风格迁移和图像重建，无需修改CLIP权重。

Conclusion: 判别式模型可能具备未被开发的生成潜力，为生成任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared
embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of
many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared
space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is
nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or
fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural
representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying
frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we
introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal
Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending
loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's
weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation,
style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that
discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain
sight.

TL;DR: VScan是一个两阶段的视觉令牌缩减框架，通过整合全局和局部扫描及中间层剪枝，显著加速大视觉语言模型推理速度，同时保持高性能。

Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型（LVLM）因细粒度的视觉感知导致计算成本高，难以实时部署。需要一种有效方法在不显著损失性能的情况下减少计算开销。

Method: 提出VScan框架，结合视觉编码阶段的全局与局部扫描令牌合并，以及在语言模型中间层引入剪枝。

Result: 在四个LVLM上验证，VScan实现了推理加速（2.91倍预填充加速，10倍FLOPs减少），并在16个基准测试中性能优于现有方法，保留95.4%的原始性能。

Conclusion: VScan通过两阶段令牌缩减显著提升LVLM的推理效率，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal
understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding.
However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer
visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate
this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at
the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language
model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their
effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are
processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided
by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction
framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary
global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2)
introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive
experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in
accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current
state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a
10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4% of the original
performance.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) often fail at cultural competency
evaluations and benchmarks. Given the diversity of applications built upon
VLMs, there is renewed interest in understanding how they encode cultural
nuances. While individual aspects of this problem have been studied, we still
lack a comprehensive framework for systematically identifying and annotating
the nuanced cultural dimensions present in images for VLMs. This position paper
argues that foundational methodologies from visual culture studies (cultural
studies, semiotics, and visual studies) are necessary for cultural analysis of
images. Building upon this review, we propose a set of five frameworks,
corresponding to cultural dimensions, that must be considered for a more
complete analysis of the cultural competencies of VLMs.

Abstract: The rise of text-to-image (T2I) models has enabled the synthesis of

Extensive experiments across multiple T2I models validate its effectiveness,

Motivation: 红外小目标检测在军事、海事等领域至关重要，但现有深度学习方法存在信息丢失和全局上下文建模效率低的问题。针对这些问题，本文提出了 SAMamba 框架。

Method: SAMamba 集成了 SAM2 的分层特征学习和 Mamba 的选择性序列建模，包含三个关键创新：FS-Adapter 用于领域适应，CSI 模块用于全局上下文建模，DPCF 模块用于多尺度特征融合。

Result: 在 NUAA-SIRST、IRSTD-1k 和 NUDT-SIRST 数据集上的实验表明，SAMamba 显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂背景和多尺度目标场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: SAMamba 通过创新模块有效解决了红外小目标检测的核心挑战，为复杂场景下的目标检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is vital for long-range surveillance
in military, maritime, and early warning applications. ISTD is challenged by
targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from
complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from
information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.
This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical
feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations
include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient
natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level
with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)
A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global
context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;
and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively
combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance
high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses
core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained
details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on
NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with
heterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales. Code:

Conclusion: 多模态强化学习框架显著提升了视频摘要和高亮检测的性能，且能利用大规模未标注数据克服标注数据不足的问题。

Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can
be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and
highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine
video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and
highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the
best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In
this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and
their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the
video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is
trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse
and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments
with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training
allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the
challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our
experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight
detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual
content of the video.

Conclusion: FUSS证明了在无监督联邦学习中实现语义分割的可行性，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: This work explores the application of Federated Learning (FL) in Unsupervised
Semantic image Segmentation (USS). Recent USS methods extract pixel-level
features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through
self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are
then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending
these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster
centroid alignment across distributed clients -- an inherently difficult task
under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To
address this, we propose FUSS Federated Unsupervised image Semantic
Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully
decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel
federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype
space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic
centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including
binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently
outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL
algorithms under varying client data distributions. To support reproducibility,
full code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

Method: 设计了R2I-Bench基准，包含多个推理类别的数据实例，并开发了R2IScore评分标准，基于问答式问题评估文本-图像对齐、推理准确性和图像质量。

Result: 实验表明，16种代表性T2I模型的推理性能普遍有限，凸显了下一代T2I系统需要更强大的推理感知架构。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具鲁棒性和推理能力的T2I架构。

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental capability often required in real-world
text-to-image (T2I) generation, e.g., generating ``a bitten apple that has been
left in the air for more than a week`` necessitates understanding temporal
decay and commonsense concepts. While recent T2I models have made impressive
progress in producing photorealistic images, their reasoning capability remains
underdeveloped and insufficiently evaluated. To bridge this gap, we introduce
R2I-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess
reasoning-driven T2I generation. R2I-Bench comprises meticulously curated data
instances, spanning core reasoning categories, including commonsense,
mathematical, logical, compositional, numerical, causal, and concept mixing. To
facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we design R2IScore, a QA-style metric based
on instance-specific, reasoning-oriented evaluation questions that assess three
critical dimensions: text-image alignment, reasoning accuracy, and image
quality. Extensive experiments with 16 representative T2I models, including a
strong pipeline-based framework that decouples reasoning and generation using
the state-of-the-art language and image generation models, demonstrate
consistently limited reasoning performance, highlighting the need for more
robust, reasoning-aware architectures in the next generation of T2I systems.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in
human-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the
development of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and
anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this
gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for
pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and
patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained
CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into
non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a
projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using
prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text
encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and
text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.
Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic
and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We
also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of
adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains
(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the
effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the
pedestrian attribute recognition. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR.

Conclusion: 研究表明，RL微调对VAR模型既高效又有效，尤其适合在线采样场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained generative models with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
has emerged as an effective approach for aligning outputs more closely with
nuanced human preferences. In this paper, we investigate the application of
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual
autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this
approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic
predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and
enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by
leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial
ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate
images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during
pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient
and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference
speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses
significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations
from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks.
This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw
puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings.
\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random
guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to
complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training
on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with
effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can
learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source
models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for
step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the
final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns
appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing
alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results
demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL
optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may
vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of
jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL
and its potential in multimodal learning. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的基准VF-Eval，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在AI生成内容（AIGC）视频上的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并展示了如何通过RePrompt实验改进视频生成。

Motivation: 现有评估多聚焦于自然视频，忽略了AIGC视频的评估需求，同时视频生成领域依赖MLLMs评估质量，但其对AIGC视频的理解能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出VF-Eval基准，包含一致性验证、错误感知、错误类型检测和推理评估四项任务，评估了13种前沿MLLMs，并通过RePrompt实验探索其应用。

Result: 即使表现最佳的GPT-4.1模型在所有任务中表现也不一致，显示了基准的挑战性；RePrompt实验表明MLLMs与人类反馈对齐可改善视频生成。

Conclusion: VF-Eval有效揭示了MLLMs在AIGC视频上的不足，并通过RePrompt验证了改进潜力。

Abstract: MLLMs have been widely studied for video question answering recently.
However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking
synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in
video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but
the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely
underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which
introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type
detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities
of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that
even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good
performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our
benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval
in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt,
demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit
video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAN-sharpening论文提出PAN-Crafter框架，通过模态一致性对齐解决PAN与MS图像的多模态不对齐问题，显著提升HRMS图像质量。

Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法在多模态不对齐情况下导致的频谱失真、双边缘和模糊问题。

Method: 提出模态自适应重建（MARs）和跨模态对齐感知注意力（CM3A）机制，联合重建HRMS和PAN图像，并双向对齐特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，推理速度提升50.11倍，内存占用减少0.63倍，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: PAN-Crafter在跨模态对齐和效率方面具有显著优势，适用于多种卫星数据集。

Abstract: PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution
multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused
by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a
fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect
pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to
spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present.
To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment
framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS
modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a
single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's
high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we
introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism
that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa,
enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$
faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it
demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets,
showing its robustness across different conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMSI-Bench is a new benchmark for multi-image spatial intelligence in MLLMs, highlighting a significant performance gap between models and humans.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on single-image relations, failing to address the multi-image spatial reasoning needed for real-world applications.

Method: Developed a VQA benchmark with 1,000 challenging questions from 120,000+ images, evaluated 34 MLLMs, and provided an error analysis pipeline.

Result: Top open-source model scored 30% accuracy, proprietary model 40%, while humans achieved 97%.

Conclusion: MMSI-Bench is challenging and reveals substantial room for improvement in multi-image spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is essential for multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) operating in the complex physical world. Existing benchmarks, however,
probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image
spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench,
a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision
researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging,
unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired
with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We
conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model
attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while
humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench
and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated
reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that
diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2)
overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation
reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for
advancing multi-image spatial intelligence. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VModA框架提升了NSFW内容的检测准确性，适应多样化审核规则，且在不同类别、场景和VLMs中表现优异。

Motivation: NSFW内容在社交媒体泛滥，现有检测方法难以应对复杂语义和多样化审核规则的挑战。

Method: 提出VModA框架，适应多样化审核规则，处理语义复杂的NSFW内容。

Result: VModA在多个NSFW类型中准确率提升54.3%，并显示了跨类别和场景的强适应性。

Conclusion: VModA是一种通用且有效的NSFW内容检测框架，实际应用表现优异。

Abstract: Not Safe/Suitable for Work (NSFW) content is rampant on social networks and
poses serious harm to citizens, especially minors. Current detection methods
mainly rely on deep learning-based image recognition and classification.
However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways,
often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or
attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often
evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further
complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create
additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and
reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective
framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex,
semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show
that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3%
accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics.
Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability
across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent
and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated
them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have
confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world
scenarios to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

TL;DR: EdiDub, 一个新框架，将视觉配音重新定义为内容感知编辑任务，显著提升了身份保存和同步效果。

Motivation: 现有视觉配音方法在保持原始场景无缝集成和处理遮挡、光照变化等复杂视觉信息时存在局限。

Method: EdiDub 通过内容感知编辑任务和专用条件方案，保留原始视频上下文，实现精准修改而非简单复制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，包括具有挑战性的遮挡嘴唇数据集，EdiDub 显著提升了身份保存和同步效果，并在人类评估中获得更高的同步和视觉自然度评分。

Conclusion: 内容感知编辑方法优于传统的生成或修复技术，特别是在保持复杂视觉元素和准确唇同步方面。

Abstract: Visual dubbing, the synchronization of facial movements with new speech, is
crucial for making content accessible across different languages, enabling
broader global reach. However, current methods face significant limitations.
Existing approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless
integration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard
vital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This
work introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a
content-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by
utilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate
modifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a
challenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity
preservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores
compared to the leading methods. These results demonstrate that our
content-aware editing approach outperforms traditional generation or
inpainting, particularly in maintaining complex visual elements while ensuring
accurate lip synchronization.

TL;DR: CryoCCD是一个结合生物物理建模与生成技术的合成框架，用于生成高质量冷冻电镜显微图像，解决了现有方法难以捕捉生物标本结构多样性和复杂噪声的局限性。

Motivation: 冷冻电镜（cryo-EM）虽能实现近原子分辨率成像，但高质量标注数据的稀缺阻碍了稳健模型的开发。现有合成方法无法同时模拟生物标本的结构多样性和复杂噪声。

Method: 提出CryoCCD框架，通过生物物理建模生成多尺度冷冻电镜图像，并采用条件扩散模型模拟真实噪声，结合循环一致性和掩膜感知对比学习提升结构保真度和噪声模式适应性。

Result: 实验表明，CryoCCD生成的图像结构准确，下游任务（如粒子拾取和重建）性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CryoCCD显著提升了冷冻电镜图像合成的真实性和下游任务表现，为数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offers near-atomic resolution imaging of
macromolecules, but developing robust models for downstream analysis is
hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. While synthetic data
generation has emerged as a potential solution, existing methods often fail to
capture both the structural diversity of biological specimens and the complex,
spatially varying noise inherent in cryo-EM imaging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that integrates
biophysical modeling with generative techniques. Specifically, CryoCCD produces
multi-scale cryo-EM micrographs that reflect realistic biophysical variability
through compositional heterogeneity, cellular context, and physics-informed
imaging. To generate realistic noise, we employ a conditional diffusion model,
enhanced by cycle consistency to preserve structural fidelity and mask-aware
contrastive learning to capture spatially adaptive noise patterns. Extensive
experiments show that CryoCCD generates structurally accurate micrographs and
enhances performance in downstream tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines in both particle picking and reconstruction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了DeepChest，一种高效动态任务加权框架，用于多标签胸部X光分类，解决了多任务学习中任务贡献平衡的难题。

Motivation: 多任务学习在医学影像等复杂领域具有优势，但任务贡献的平衡仍是挑战。

Method: 基于任务特定损失趋势分析的性能驱动加权机制，无需梯度访问，自适应调整任务重要性。

Result: DeepChest在多标签CXR分类中领先现有方法7%的整体准确率，并显著减少内存使用和训练时间。

Conclusion: DeepChest为深度学习在医学诊断中的实际应用提供了高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multi-Task Learning (MTL) offers inherent advantages in complex domains
such as medical imaging by enabling shared representation learning, effectively
balancing task contributions remains a significant challenge. This paper
addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel,
computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework
specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike
existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial
overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on
effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture
(e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task
importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing
memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be
easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only
outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also
yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved
generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency
and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust
deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications. The

TL;DR: TrajViT提出的基于物体轨迹的tokenization方法显著减少了冗余token，同时保持了时序一致性，在多项任务中大幅优于传统ViT3D。

Motivation: 现有视频tokenization方法通过时空分块生成过多冗余token，导致计算效率低下且性能下降。

Method: 提出grounded video tokenization，基于物体轨迹生成语义token；使用TrajViT编码器结合对比学习训练。

Result: TrajViT在视频检索任务中Top-5召回率比ViT3D高6%，token减少10倍；作为VideoLLM编码器时性能提升5.2%，训练快4倍，推理FLOPs少18倍。

Conclusion: TrajViT是首个在多样视频任务中高效超越ViT3D的编码器，具备强扩展性。

Abstract: Effective video tokenization is critical for scaling transformer models for
long videos. Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches,
leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token
reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens
when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm
that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than
fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles,
ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video
duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories
and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing
redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive
learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a
large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with
10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for
being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2%
performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster
training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient
encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks,
making it a robust and scalable solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares two methods for constructing topological feature vectors from medical images using persistent homology, concluding that feature concatenation outperforms barcode aggregation in preserving detailed information and improving classification performance.

Motivation: Traditional feature extraction in medical image analysis is sensitive to data perturbations. Persistent homology offers a robust alternative, but the best method to construct topological feature vectors from multiple barcodes is unclear.

Method: The study compares two approaches: aggregating persistence barcodes before featurization vs. concatenating feature vectors from individual barcodes, tested across diverse medical imaging datasets.

Result: Feature concatenation preserves more detailed topological information and leads to better classification performance compared to barcode aggregation.

Conclusion: For similar experiments, concatenating topological feature vectors from individual barcodes is the preferred approach due to its superior performance.

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the
design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH),
from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and
stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional
feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large
change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and
geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars
represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical
information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D
medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological
feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by
featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each
barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned
approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this
analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological
information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance
and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于全面语言描述的视觉追踪框架CLDTracker，通过结合视觉和文本特征的双分支架构，解决了传统追踪器在复杂场景下的局限性，并在六个标准基准测试中实现了最优性能。

Motivation: 传统追踪器主要依赖视觉线索，难以应对动态外观变化、遮挡和背景干扰等复杂场景。近期视觉语言模型（VLM）的进展展示了其在理解语义方面的潜力，但直接应用于视觉追踪（VOT）仍存在缺乏丰富文本表示、视觉与文本特征融合效率低以及对目标外观的时间演化建模不足等问题。

Method: 提出了CLDTracker，采用双分支架构（文本分支和视觉分支），其中文本分支利用CLIP和GPT-4V等强大的VLM生成丰富的文本描述，并结合语义和上下文信息，以弥补现有方法的不足。

Result: 在六个标准VOT基准测试中实现了SOTA（State-of-the-Art）性能，验证了基于视觉语言表示的追踪方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLDTracker通过有效融合视觉和文本特征，并结合目标外观的时间演化建模，显著提升了复杂场景下视觉追踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to
dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional
trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex
scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic
understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning,
suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to
VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and
comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target
object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information;
inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and
textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack
of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language
domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the
object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full
potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive
Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker
introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual
branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions
derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with
semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual
representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that
CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of
leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for
tracking. Code and models are publicly available at:

Result: 相比其他预训练策略，SLIMP在下游任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: SLIMP通过充分利用多模态数据提升表征质量，改善分类效果。

Abstract: We introduce SLIMP (Skin Lesion Image-Metadata Pre-training) for learning
rich representations of skin lesions through a novel nested contrastive
learning approach that captures complex relationships between images and
metadata. Melanoma detection and skin lesion classification based solely on
images, pose significant challenges due to large variations in imaging
conditions (lighting, color, resolution, distance, etc.) and lack of clinical
and phenotypical context. Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for
assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be
malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history
as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this,
SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with
patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically
relevant information. By fully exploiting all available data modalities
throughout the learning process, the proposed pre-training strategy improves
performance compared to other pre-training strategies on downstream skin
lesions classification tasks highlighting the learned representations quality.

Conclusion: CFP-Gen为组合性多模态约束下的蛋白质设计提供了高效、精准的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing PLMs generate protein sequences based on a single-condition
constraint from a specific modality, struggling to simultaneously satisfy
multiple constraints across different modalities. In this work, we introduce
CFP-Gen, a novel diffusion language model for Combinatorial Functional Protein
GENeration. CFP-Gen facilitates the de novo protein design by integrating
multimodal conditions with functional, sequence, and structural constraints.
Specifically, an Annotation-Guided Feature Modulation (AGFM) module is
introduced to dynamically adjust the protein feature distribution based on
composable functional annotations, e.g., GO terms, IPR domains and EC numbers.
Meanwhile, the Residue-Controlled Functional Encoding (RCFE) module captures
residue-wise interaction to ensure more precise control. Additionally,
off-the-shelf 3D structure encoders can be seamlessly integrated to impose
geometric constraints. We demonstrate that CFP-Gen enables high-throughput
generation of novel proteins with functionality comparable to natural proteins,
while achieving a high success rate in designing multifunctional proteins. Code

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态CAD重建模型，利用视觉语言模型（VLM）同时处理点云、图像和文本输入，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习微调）在多个数据集上达到最优性能。

Motivation: 现有CAD重建方法通常仅支持单一输入模态，限制了泛化性和鲁棒性；本文旨在通过多模态输入和强化学习提升模型性能。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 在大规模程序生成数据上进行监督微调（SFT）；2) 通过在线反馈进行强化学习微调（RL），探索了Group Relative Preference Optimization（GRPO）等算法。

Result: 在DeepCAD基准测试中，SFT模型在三种输入模态上均优于单模态方法；RL微调后，模型在三个数据集（包括真实场景）上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 多模态输入结合强化学习微调显著提升了CAD重建的泛化性和性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and
manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models.
Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD
reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing
methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds,
images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging
recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD
reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities.
Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage
pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated
data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online
feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL
fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such
as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline
alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing
single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More
importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three
challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

Abstract: Video generation has made substantial strides with the emergence of deep
generative models, especially diffusion-based approaches. However, video
generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant
challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high
generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for

coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images
and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic
masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various
subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without
architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism
that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features.
Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from
single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent
synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing
open-source and commercial baselines. To facilitate evaluation, we also
introduce a comprehensive multi-subject video benchmark. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, paving the way for scalable,

TL;DR: SOYO是一个轻量级框架，通过高斯混合压缩器（GMC）和域特征重采样器（DFR）优化参数隔离增量学习（PIDIL），在多领域任务中表现优越。

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）在动态数据分布环境中的性能下降问题，尤其是参数隔离增量学习方法在参数选择准确性上的不足。

Method: 提出SOYO框架，包含GMC、DFR和多层次域特征融合网络（MDFN），支持多种参数高效微调方法。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，SOYO表现优于现有基线方法，展现其鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SOYO在复杂动态环境中具有显著优势，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) often underperform in real-world, dynamic
settings where data distributions change over time. Domain Incremental Learning
(DIL) offers a solution by enabling continual model adaptation, with
Parameter-Isolation DIL (PIDIL) emerging as a promising paradigm to reduce
knowledge conflicts. However, existing PIDIL methods struggle with parameter
selection accuracy, especially as the number of domains and corresponding
classes grows. To address this, we propose SOYO, a lightweight framework that
improves domain selection in PIDIL. SOYO introduces a Gaussian Mixture
Compressor (GMC) and Domain Feature Resampler (DFR) to store and balance prior
domain data efficiently, while a Multi-level Domain Feature Fusion Network
(MDFN) enhances domain feature extraction. Our framework supports multiple
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods and is validated across tasks
such as image classification, object detection, and speech enhancement.
Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate SOYO's consistent
superiority over existing baselines, showcasing its robustness and adaptability
in complex, evolving environments. The codes will be released in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrustVLM提出了一种无需重新训练的方法，通过利用图像嵌入空间中的模态差异来提高Vision-Language Models (VLMs)的预测可靠性，显著改进了错误分类检测性能。

Motivation: 现有VLMs在零样本学习和迁移学习场景中表现优秀，但在安全关键领域容易产生自信的错误预测，这带来了严重风险，因此需要一种方法来估计VLM预测的可信度。

Method: TrustVLM是一个无需训练的新框架，它通过分析VLMs中的模态差距和图像嵌入空间中概念的区分度，提出了一种新的置信度评分函数。

Result: 在17个不同数据集、4种架构和2种VLMs上的实验表明，TrustVLM在AURC、AUROC和FPR95等指标上显著优于现有基线，最高提升51.87%、9.14%和32.42%。

Conclusion: TrustVLM通过改进模型可靠性而无需重新训练，为VLMs在现实世界中的安全部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
aligning visual and textual modalities, enabling a wide range of applications
in multimodal understanding and generation. While they excel in zero-shot and
transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,
often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a
significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can
lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a
training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of
estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed
modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly
represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring
function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We
rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4
architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95
compared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model
without requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of
VLMs in real-world applications. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spatial-MLLM通过双编码器架构和空间感知帧采样策略，仅基于2D输入实现了卓越的空间推理能力，并在各类视觉空间任务中达到SOTA性能。

Motivation: 现有3D MLLMs依赖额外3D或2.5D数据，限制了其在纯2D输入场景的应用，因此需要一种无需额外数据的空间推理框架。

Method: 提出双编码器架构（语义编码器+空间编码器）和空间感知帧采样策略，结合视觉几何模型的结构先验。

Result: 在多种真实数据集上实现SOTA性能，验证了框架在视觉空间理解任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: Spatial-MLLM为纯2D输入场景的空间推理提供了高效解决方案，并开源数据集和模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their
spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on
additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their
utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this
paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial
reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which
rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our
key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward
visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder
architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and
a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to
extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into
unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we
propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects
the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under
limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial
reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k
dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.
Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our
spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of
visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. Project page:

TL;DR: LADA是一个基于CLIP视觉语言模型的持续学习方法，通过添加轻量级标签特定记忆单元来防止性能退化。

Motivation: 现有CLIP基方法通过添加多组可学习参数导致推理时参数选择容易出错，影响性能。

Method: LADA在冻结的CLIP图像编码器后附加轻量级标签特定记忆单元，利用特征蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: LADA在持续学习设置中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LADA通过避免梯度流到CLIP参数并聚合任务无关知识，有效提升持续学习效果。

Abstract: Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway
toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable
representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image
encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a
partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for
input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades
performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific
ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends
lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder,
enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic
knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature
distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered
with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient
flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training. Extensive
results show that LADA achieves state-of-the-art performance in continual
learning settings. The implementation code is available at

TL;DR: TimePoint是自监督方法，利用合成数据学习关键点和描述符，显著加速DTW对齐且提升准确性。

Motivation: 传统DTW方法在可扩展性和噪声敏感性上表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合1D微分同胚生成合成数据，采用全卷积和小波卷积架构提取关键点与描述符，再应用DTW稀疏表示。

Result: 实验表明TimePoint在速度和准确性上均优于传统DTW，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TimePoint为时间序列分析提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further
improves with fine-tuning on real data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TimePoint consistently achieves faster and more accurate alignments than
standard DTW, making it a scalable solution for time-series analysis. Our code

TL;DR: OmniEarth-Bench是一个全面的地球科学多模态基准，涵盖六个地球科学领域和跨领域交互，包含100个专家策划的评估维度，旨在填补现有基准在系统和评估维度上的不足。

Motivation: 现有地球科学多模态学习基准在覆盖地球系统组件和跨领域交互方面存在系统性不足，仅涉及孤立子系统且评估维度有限，OmniEarth-Bench旨在解决这些差距。

Method: 整合卫星传感器和现场观测数据，涵盖感知、通用推理、科学知识推理和链式推理四个层次，由专家和众包标注者共同完成29,779个标注。

Result: 在9个最先进的多模态大模型上测试，即使是性能最佳的模型也表现不佳，准确率不足35%，某些跨领域任务中GPT-4o的准确率降至0.0%。

Conclusion: OmniEarth-Bench为地学感知AI设立了新标准，推动了科学发现及环境监测和灾害预测的实际应用。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for Earth science multimodal learning exhibit critical
limitations in systematic coverage of geosystem components and cross-sphere
interactions, often constrained to isolated subsystems (only in
Human-activities sphere or atmosphere) with limited evaluation dimensions (less
than 16 tasks). To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEarth-Bench, the first
comprehensive multimodal benchmark spanning all six Earth science spheres
(atmosphere, lithosphere, Oceansphere, cryosphere, biosphere and
Human-activities sphere) and cross-spheres with one hundred expert-curated
evaluation dimensions. Leveraging observational data from satellite sensors and
in-situ measurements, OmniEarth-Bench integrates 29,779 annotations across four
tiers: perception, general reasoning, scientific knowledge reasoning and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. This involves the efforts of 2-5 experts per
sphere to establish authoritative evaluation dimensions and curate relevant
observational datasets, 40 crowd-sourcing annotators to assist experts for
annotations, and finally, OmniEarth-Bench is validated via hybrid expert-crowd
workflows to reduce label ambiguity. Experiments on 9 state-of-the-art MLLMs
reveal that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where
none of them reach 35\% accuracy. Especially, in some cross-spheres tasks, the
performance of leading models like GPT-4o drops to 0.0\%. OmniEarth-Bench sets
a new standard for geosystem-aware AI, advancing both scientific discovery and
practical applications in environmental monitoring and disaster prediction. The
dataset, source code, and trained models were released.

TL;DR: Qwen-LA是一种新型视觉语言推理模型(VLRM)，通过引入视觉-文本反思过程来减少幻觉，并利用强化学习优化反思策略，提升视觉注意力。

Motivation: 长推理过程会稀释视觉标记，导致视觉信息被忽视并可能引发幻觉，仅依靠文本反思不足以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出平衡反射策略优化(BRPO)和视觉标记COPY/ROUTE机制，强制模型在推理中重新关注视觉信息。

Result: Qwen-LA在多个视觉问答数据集和幻觉指标上表现出领先的准确性并减少幻觉。

Conclusion: 视觉-文本反思和视觉标记机制有效提升了视觉注意力并减少幻觉。

Abstract: Inference time scaling drives extended reasoning to enhance the performance
of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), thus forming powerful Vision-Language
Reasoning Models (VLRMs). However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,
causing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger
hallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows
promise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress
hallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain
(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a
vision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual
information during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method
Balanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to
decide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the
number and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose
attention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that
supplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.
Therefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token
ROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at
the visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.
Experiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate
that Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing
hallucinations. Our code is available at:

Method: 引入保护群体网络，提出公平性-模块化度量，开发Fair Fast Newman (FairFN)算法，优化模块化和公平性。

Result: 实验表明，FairFN在公平性和分区质量上显著优于现有方法，尤其在不平衡数据集上表现更佳。

Conclusion: FairFN算法能有效平衡模块化和公平性，适用于保护群体的网络分区。

Abstract: Community partitioning is crucial in network analysis, with modularity
optimization being the prevailing technique. However, traditional
modularity-based methods often overlook fairness, a critical aspect in
real-world applications. To address this, we introduce protected group networks
and propose a novel fairness-modularity metric. This metric extends traditional
modularity by explicitly incorporating fairness, and we prove that minimizing
it yields naturally fair partitions for protected groups while maintaining
theoretical soundness. We develop a general optimization framework for fairness
partitioning and design the efficient Fair Fast Newman (FairFN) algorithm,
enhancing the Fast Newman (FN) method to optimize both modularity and fairness.
Experiments show FairFN achieves significantly improved fairness and
high-quality partitions compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on
unbalanced datasets.

Abstract: We investigate the end-to-end altitude estimation performance of a

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow

steady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the

the underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that
integrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a
distributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and
mean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world

Abstract: Exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) are crucial in software development for

CodeLlama and incorporates reasoning about exception-throwing traces,
conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional
behavior tests that execute similar traces. Our demonstration video illustrates
how exLong can effectively assist developers in creating comprehensive EBTs for

standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been
updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and
depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment
setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and
data contamination. In this work, we present \textbf{SWE-bench-Live}, a
\textit{live-updatable} benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our
initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created
since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated
Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is
\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process
from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and
enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of
state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a
substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even
under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy,
we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task
difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in
live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous,
contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world
software development settings.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了研究软件的重要性及其在生命科学中的元数据分析，提出了利用指令调整的大型语言模型进行软件元数据身份解析的方法，并通过与人工标注的黄金标准对比，验证了其高精度和统计稳健性。

Motivation: 研究软件在科研活动中扮演重要角色，但其重要性未得到足够关注。本文旨在通过整合和分析不同平台的软件元数据，提升软件的可发现性和可持续性。

Method: 采用指令调整的大型语言模型进行软件元数据身份解析，并通过与人工标注的黄金标准对比，评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究展示了大型语言模型在软件元数据分析中的潜力，但需进一步优化以应对异构性和规模化的挑战。

Abstract: Software is an essential component of research. However, little attention has
been paid to it compared with that paid to research data. Recently, there has
been an increase in efforts to acknowledge and highlight the importance of
software in research activities.
  Structured metadata from platforms like bio.tools, Bioconductor, and Galaxy
ToolShed offers valuable insights into research software in the Life Sciences.
Although originally intended to support discovery and integration, this
metadata can be repurposed for large-scale analysis of software practices.
However, its quality and completeness vary across platforms, reflecting diverse
documentation practices.
  To gain a comprehensive view of software development and sustainability,
consolidating this metadata is necessary, but requires robust mechanisms to
address its heterogeneity and scale.
  This article presents an evaluation of instruction-tuned large language
models for the task of software metadata identity resolution, a critical step
in assembling a cohesive collection of research software. Such a collection is
the reference component for the Software Observatory at OpenEBench, a platform
that aggregates metadata to monitor the FAIRness of research software in the
Life Sciences.
  We benchmarked multiple models against a human-annotated gold standard,
examined their behavior on ambiguous cases, and introduced an agreement-based
proxy for high-confidence automated decisions. The proxy achieved high
precision and statistical robustness, while also highlighting the limitations
of current models and the broader challenges of automating semantic judgment in
FAIR-aligned software metadata across registries and repositories.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GSO benchmark evaluates language models' ability to optimize high-performance software, revealing low success rates (5%) and identifying key failure modes like low-level language challenges and bottleneck localization issues.

Motivation: Assessing language models' capabilities in high-performance software development, given its complexity and the need for specialized expertise.

Method: Automated pipeline generates performance tests from repository commit histories, identifying 102 optimization tasks across 10 diverse codebases. Agents improve runtime efficiency against expert benchmarks.

Result: Leading SWE-Agents achieve <5% success rate, with minimal improvements despite inference-time scaling. Common failure modes include low-level language barriers and poor bottleneck identification.

Conclusion: Current models struggle with high-performance optimization tasks, highlighting limitations in low-level coding and optimization strategy. Benchmark resources are released for future research.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires
specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language
models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an
automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze
repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks
across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An
agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise
specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured
against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success
rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our
qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with
low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in
accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our
benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种测试时迭代优化框架，通过闭环系统让大语言模型（LLMs）基于执行沙箱的反馈迭代优化代码效率。三种训练策略中，GRPO（基于强化学习）表现最佳，显著提升了代码效率。

Motivation: 尽管LLMs能生成功能正确的代码，但其代码效率不足限制了实际部署。论文旨在通过测试时优化框架解决这一问题。

Method: 采用闭环系统，LLMs根据执行沙箱的反馈迭代优化代码。比较了三种训练策略：SFT、DPO和GRPO（基于强化学习）。

Result: GRPO显著提升了pass@1（从47%到62%）和效率超越人类提交的概率（从31%到45%），远优于SFT和DPO。

Conclusion: 强化学习在提升LLMs代码效率方面效果显著，验证了测试时优化框架的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but
often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world
deployment. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative
optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where
LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an
execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy
Optimization~(GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark
show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO,
using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously
optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to
62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from
31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency
improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly
self-improve code efficiency.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过快速三级综述分析了九篇关于AI治理的二次研究，总结了主要框架和原则，并指出了现有研究中的不足。

Motivation: 当前关于AI治理的文献缺乏对各种治理框架和实践的综合分析，因此需要系统性地梳理现有研究。

Method: 采用快速三级综述方法，对2020至2024年间IEEE和ACM的九篇同行评审二次研究进行了主题语义综合分析。

Result: 最常被引用的框架包括欧盟AI法案和NIST RMF；透明度和问责制是最常见的原则，但研究中缺乏可操作的治理机制或利益相关者策略。

Conclusion: 综述整合了AI治理的关键方向，并指出了实证验证和包容性方面的不足，为学术研究和实际应用提供了参考。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance is the practice of establishing
frameworks, policies, and procedures to ensure the responsible, ethical, and
safe development and deployment of AI systems. Although AI governance is a core
pillar of Responsible AI, current literature still lacks synthesis across such
governance frameworks and practices. Objective: To identify which frameworks,
principles, mechanisms, and stakeholder roles are emphasized in secondary
literature on AI governance. Method: We conducted a rapid tertiary review of
nine peer-reviewed secondary studies from IEEE and ACM (20202024), using
structured inclusion criteria and thematic semantic synthesis. Results: The
most cited frameworks include the EU AI Act and NIST RMF; transparency and
accountability are the most common principles. Few reviews detail actionable
governance mechanisms or stakeholder strategies. Conclusion: The review
consolidates key directions in AI governance and highlights gaps in empirical
validation and inclusivity. Findings inform both academic inquiry and practical
adoption in organizations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CTIM-Rover是一个基于AutoCodeRover的AI代理，引入了跨任务实例记忆（CTIM）以提高软件工程任务的长期记忆能力，但实际表现未超越AutoCodeRover，可能因记忆噪音导致性能下降。

Motivation: 现有开源软件工程代理依赖的推理框架（如ReAct、Reflexion、Code-Act）在任务完成后丢弃长期记忆，而仓库级理解对修复漏洞尤为重要，因此探索CTIM的潜力。

Method: 基于ExpeL的体验学习方法，采用混合专家（MoEs）方法构建通用及仓库级CTIM，扩展AutoCodeRover的代理推理框架。

Result: CTIM-Rover在所有配置中均未超越AutoCodeRover，性能下降可能源于CTIM项目或轨迹示例引入的噪音。

Conclusion: ExpeL和DoT-Bank未能有效扩展至实际软件工程问题，CTIM的实用性受限。

Abstract: We introduce CTIM-Rover, an AI agent for Software Engineering (SE) built on
top of AutoCodeRover (Zhang et al., 2024) that extends agentic reasoning
frameworks with an episodic memory, more specifically, a general and
repository-level Cross-Task-Instance Memory (CTIM). While existing open-source
SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al.,
2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning
frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task
instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all
locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is
particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the
Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a
Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose
and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform
AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor
DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems. Our analysis
indicates noise introduced by distracting CTIM items or exemplar trajectories
as the likely source of the performance degradation.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该论文重新定义了大型语言模型（LLMs）为动态集体人类知识（CK）的体现，强调通过对话而非静态存储来激发智能，探讨了对话模式、微调的影响及人机协同增强。

Motivation: 传统研究多从架构、行为或训练数据角度分析LLMs，本文旨在提供新视角：将LLMs视为动态集体知识的体现，以更深入地理解其交互、表征和代理行为。

Method: 结合神经科学与AI理论，通过与ChatGPT-4的持续互动，分析对话模式、微调的影响及人机认知协同增强（co-augmentation）。

Result: 揭示了对话在LLMs智能表现中的核心作用，以及人机协同如何相互提升认知能力，为AI系统提供了新理解框架。

Conclusion: 动态集体知识视角为LLMs的交互、表征和代理机制提供了创新解读，强调对话是智能的核心驱动力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically analysed through architectural,
behavioural, or training-data lenses. This article offers a theoretical and
experiential re-framing: LLMs as dynamic instantiations of Collective human
Knowledge (CK), where intelligence is evoked through dialogue rather than
stored statically. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience and AI, and grounded
in sustained interaction with ChatGPT-4, I examine emergent dialogue patterns,
the implications of fine-tuning, and the notion of co-augmentation: mutual
enhancement between human and machine cognition. This perspective offers a new
lens for understanding interaction, representation, and agency in contemporary
AI systems.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种新型浏览器Orca，通过AI辅助用户在大规模网页中探索、操作和组织内容，提升信息处理效率和用户体验。

Motivation: 传统浏览器在多标签页环境下难以支持大规模信息的操作和合成，而现有的AI系统虽能自动化浏览但削弱了用户控制力。因此，研究旨在探索如何用AI增强用户在多网页间的交互能力。

Method: 通过文献综述和迭代设计过程，开发了原型浏览器Orca，将网页视为可塑材料，支持用户与AI协作操作和合成内容。

Result: 评估显示，Orca提高了用户的信息获取意愿、控制力及在更广泛信息环境中的灵活性。

Conclusion: Orca证明了AI辅助的协作式浏览器设计能有效提升用户在大规模信息处理中的能力和体验。

Abstract: Web-based activities are fundamentally distributed across webpages. However,
conventional browsers with stacks of tabs fail to support operating and
synthesizing large volumes of information across pages. While recent AI systems
enable fully automated web browsing and information synthesis, they often
diminish user agency and hinder contextual understanding. Therefore, we explore
how AI could instead augment users' interactions with content across webpages
and mitigate cognitive and manual efforts. Through literature on information
tasks and web browsing challenges, and an iterative design process, we present
a rich set of novel interactions with our prototype web browser, Orca.
Leveraging AI, Orca supports user-driven exploration, operation, organization,
and synthesis of web content at scale. To enable browsing at scale, webpages
are treated as malleable materials that humans and AI can collaboratively
manipulate and compose into a malleable, dynamic, and browser-level workspace.
Our evaluation revealed an increased "appetite" for information foraging,
enhanced user control, and more flexibility in sensemaking across a broader
information landscape on the web.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Human-in-the-loop Decoding的交互技术，通过让用户观察和影响LLM在代码生成过程中的决策，以减少过度依赖AI工具的问题，特别是在软件安全领域。

Motivation: AI编程工具虽能提升效率和能力，但常导致用户过度依赖而忽视关键决策，尤其在安全领域可能带来严重后果。因此，研究旨在设计一种新交互方式以增强用户对LLM输出的控制。

Method: 提出了Human-in-the-loop Decoding技术，并在HiLDe工具中实现。该工具高亮LLM的关键决策并提供本地替代方案供用户选择。

Result: 在18人参与的实验中发现，与传统代码补全工具相比，HiLDe显著减少了生成代码中的漏洞，并更好地满足了用户目标。

Conclusion: Human-in-the-loop Decoding技术有效提升了用户对AI生成代码的控制，减少了安全隐患。

Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers'
capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users
from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off
their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These
behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software
security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique
that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code
generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal
requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant
that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local
alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on
security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate
significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their
goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合音频特征和心理学知识的LLM多模态抑郁症检测方法，显著降低了MAE和RMSE误差。

Motivation: 现有DNN和LLM在抑郁症识别中存在局限，如缺乏非文本线索和心理学专业知识。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec提取音频特征，结合文本LLM处理，并通过问答形式引入心理学知识。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上，MAE和RMSE比基线显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态结合心理学知识能有效提升抑郁症检测性能。

Abstract: Depression is a growing concern gaining attention in both public discourse
and AI research. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used for
recognition, they still lack real-world effectiveness. Large language models
(LLMs) show strong potential but require domain-specific fine-tuning and
struggle with non-textual cues. Since depression is often expressed through
vocal tone and behaviour rather than explicit text, relying on language alone
is insufficient. Diagnostic accuracy also suffers without incorporating
psychological expertise. To address these limitations, we present, to the best
of our knowledge, the first application of LLMs to multimodal depression
detection using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. We extract the audio features using the
pre-trained model Wav2Vec, and mapped it to text-based LLMs for further
processing. We also propose a novel strategy for incorporating psychological
knowledge into LLMs to enhance diagnostic performance, specifically using a
question and answer set to grant authorised knowledge to LLMs. Our approach
yields a notable improvement in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) compared to a base score proposed by the related original
paper. The codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了HEAE框架，结合学生叙述和教师共情评估抑郁严重程度，准确率达82.74%，强调人机协作的伦理意义。

Motivation: 特殊教育环境下学生抑郁评估困难，现有方法难以捕捉个体化共情洞察，需透明且负责任的人机协作方案。

Method: 提出HEAE框架，整合学生叙述文本与教师派生的9维'共情向量'（基于PHQ-9框架），通过多模态融合优化分类架构。

Result: 在多模态融合、文本表示和分类架构优化后，7级抑郁严重程度分类准确率达82.74%。

Conclusion: HEAE在情感计算中嵌入人类共情，为伦理化人机协同提供了可行路径，增强而非替代人工判断。

Abstract: Assessing student depression in sensitive environments like special education
is challenging. Standardized questionnaires may not fully reflect students'
true situations. Furthermore, automated methods often falter with rich student
narratives, lacking the crucial, individualized insights stemming from
teachers' empathetic connections with students. Existing methods often fail to
address this ambiguity or effectively integrate educator understanding. To
address these limitations by fostering a synergistic human-AI collaboration,
this paper introduces Human Empathy as Encoder (HEAE), a novel, human-centered
AI framework for transparent and socially responsible depression severity
assessment. Our approach uniquely integrates student narrative text with a
teacher-derived, 9-dimensional "Empathy Vector" (EV), its dimensions guided by
the PHQ-9 framework,to explicitly translate tacit empathetic insight into a
structured AI input enhancing rather than replacing human judgment. Rigorous
experiments optimized the multimodal fusion, text representation, and
classification architecture, achieving 82.74% accuracy for 7-level severity
classification. This work demonstrates a path toward more responsible and
ethical affective computing by structurally embedding human empathy

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为SLIT的新型框架，旨在优化大型语言模型（LLM）的服务质量、碳排放、水资源消耗和能源成本，通过机器学习元启发式方法提升LLM托管的地理分布式云数据中心的可持续性。

Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT、CoPilot和Gemini）的广泛应用，其推理阶段的成本（包括碳足迹和水资源消耗）已远超训练阶段，引发了对环境可持续性的担忧。

Method: 提出SLIT框架，利用基于机器学习的元启发式方法，在地理分布式云数据中心中优化LLM的服务质量、碳排放、水消耗和能源成本。

Result: SLIT框架能够有效减少LLM推理阶段的碳足迹和水资源消耗，同时保持服务质量。

Conclusion: 随着LLM的普及，SLIT这类可持续性优化框架将变得愈发重要，其方法为减少LLM的环境影响提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, and
Gemini have been widely adopted in different areas. As the use of LLMs
continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training
overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user
requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies
estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed
training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative
carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the
footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of
fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To
address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel
framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first
token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes
a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of
LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters. Such a framework will
become increasingly vital as LLMs proliferate.
