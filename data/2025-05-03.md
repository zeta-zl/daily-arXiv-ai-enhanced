### [1] [Rosetta-PL: Propositional Logic as a Benchmark for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00001)
*Shaun Baek,Shaun Esua-Mensah,Cyrus Tsui,Sejan Vigneswaralingam,Abdullah Alali,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Rosetta-PL基准，用于评估LLM在逻辑推理和泛化能力方面的表现，并通过实验证明翻译方法对模型性能的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型（LLM）主要训练于高资源自然语言，其在低资源环境和深度逻辑推理任务中的表现受限，因此需要一种评估和优化方法。

Method: 研究通过将Lean中的逻辑命题数据集翻译为自定义逻辑语言，构建Rosetta-PL基准，并用其微调LLM（如GPT-4o），分析数据集规模和翻译方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，翻译过程中保持逻辑关系可显著提升模型精度，且训练样本超过约2万时准确率趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 研究为优化LLM在形式推理任务中的训练提供了指导，并有助于提升低资源语言应用中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural
languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks
requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization
capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by
translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical
language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our
experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation
methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that
preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly
boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training
samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training
in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource
language applications.

### [2] [Symbol grounding in computational systems: A paradox of intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00002)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，因为无论计算基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都隐含语义先天论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算主义是否能解释符号接地问题，揭示其潜在矛盾。

Method: 通过逻辑推理分析计算主义框架下符号接地的两种可能性。

Result: 无论符号是否有意义，计算主义都隐含语义先天论，无法解决符号接地问题。

Conclusion: 计算主义在解释符号接地问题上存在根本性缺陷，需寻找其他理论框架。

Abstract: The paper presents a paradoxical feature of computational systems that
suggests that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding. If the mind is
a digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either
over meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols. If it is computing over
meaningful symbols its functioning presupposes the existence of meaningful
symbols in the system, i.e. it implies semantic nativism. If the mind is
computing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are
available prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could
take place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes. So,
whether computing in the mind is over meaningless or over meaningful symbols,
computationalism implies semantic nativism.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文综述了心理学理论如何指导大型语言模型（LLM）的开发，强调心理学对实现类人认知的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM规模和复杂度的提升，心理学被认为是实现类人认知、行为和互动的关键，但如何系统整合心理学理论仍存在空白。

Method: 通过整合认知、发展、行为、社会、人格心理学及心理语言学的理论，分析心理学对LLM开发（数据、预训练、后训练、评估及应用）的影响。

Result: 研究发现心理学理论在LLM开发中的应用存在趋势和不足，跨领域连接与矛盾点并存。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁更系统地将心理学整合到NLP研究中，以促进LLM的进一步发展。

Abstract: Psychological insights have long shaped pivotal NLP breakthroughs, including
the cognitive underpinnings of attention mechanisms, formative reinforcement
learning, and Theory of Mind-inspired social modeling. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) continue to grow in scale and complexity, there is a rising consensus
that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and
interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and
enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training,
and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive,
developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and
psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how
psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections
and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more
thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research.

### [4] [LangVAE and LangSpace: Building and Probing for Language Model VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00004)
*Danilo S. Carvalho,Yingji Zhang,Harriet Unsworth,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangVAE是一个基于预训练大语言模型(LLMs)的变分自编码器(VAE)模块化构建框架，旨在生成更紧凑且语义解耦的表示。配套工具LangSpace提供多种分析方法（如向量遍历、解耦度量等），实验验证了其灵活性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练语言模型的知识构建更高效、可解释的文本表示，并系统化实验和理解这些表示。

Method: 通过模块化构建VAE框架LangVAE，结合LangSpace的分析工具（如向量遍历、聚类可视化等），在不同编码器-解码器组合和标注数据上进行实验。

Result: 实验展示了不同架构和规模模型在泛化与解耦方面的交互，验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LangVAE为文本表示的系统化实验和理解提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational
autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such
language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components
into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The
representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion
framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as
vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster
visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable
way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration
for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set
of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as
annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural
families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings
demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and
understanding of textual representations.

### [5] [Toward a digital twin of U.S. Congress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00006)
*Hayden Helm,Tianyi Chen,Harvey McGuinness,Paige Lee,Brandon Duderstadt,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过语言模型构建美国国会议员的虚拟模型，验证其符合数字孪生定义，并通过生成的推文预测投票行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型能否构建国会议员的数字孪生，辅助预测其行为并分析跨党派可能性。

Method: 使用每日更新的国会议员推文数据集，训练特定语言模型生成逼真推文，并用于行为预测。

Result: 模型生成的推文与真实推文难以区分，并能有效预测投票行为和跨党派倾向。

Conclusion: 数字孪生模型对立法动态分析具有潜力，但存在局限性需进一步扩展。

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S.
congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the
definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide
high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet
from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate
that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of
this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable
from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how
generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to
quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby
assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting
real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

### [7] [Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Task Learning through Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00009)
*Xiao Zhang,Kangsheng Wang,Tianyu Hu,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 针对预训练语言模型在新任务中表现不佳的问题，研究提出TA-LoRA方法（基于提示调优和低秩表示），通过慢-快权重机制和零初始化注意力机制，有效建模任务异质性，在多任务学习中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽强大，但在未见过的新任务上表现受限。单独训练每个任务的模型成本高，而现有提示调优方法（PT）因表示能力有限，难以捕捉任务特异性知识。

Method: 提出TA-LoRA方法，基于提示调优框架，引入低秩表示建模任务异质性，慢权重编码共享知识，快权重捕捉任务特异性知识；采用零初始化注意力机制减少暖启动期对原提示的干扰。

Result: 在16个任务上的实验表明，该方法在完整数据和少样本场景下均达到最优性能，且参数效率高。

Conclusion: TA-LoRA通过分层建模任务知识，解决了异质性捕捉难题，为多任务学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but
struggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.
Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task
learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from
source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that
captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt
that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,
PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific
knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this
challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL
method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task
heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes
shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,
avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training
low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention
mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank
components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks
demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and
few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

*Tri Nguyen,Lohith Srikanth Pentapalli,Magnus Sieverding,Laurah Turner,Seth Overla,Weibing Zheng,Chris Zhou,David Furniss,Danielle Weber,Michael Gharib,Matt Kelleher,Michael Shukis,Cameron Pawlik,Kelly Cohen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于语言学特征的检测方法来识别大型语言模型（LLMs）中的越狱行为，特别是在临床教育平台的应用中。通过标注2300多个提示并提取相关特征，训练多种模型后发现，基于特征的模型效果优于提示工程，尤其是模糊决策树表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs中的越狱行为会绕过伦理保护措施，威胁其在敏感领域（如教育）的安全使用，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 标注2300多个提示，提取四个与越狱行为相关的语言学特征，训练决策树、模糊逻辑分类器、提升方法和逻辑回归等模型。

Result: 基于特征的模型在检测越狱行为时表现优于提示工程，模糊决策树效果最好。

Conclusion: 语言学特征模型是检测越狱行为的有效且可解释的方案，未来可探索结合提示灵活性和规则鲁棒性的混合框架。

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in
sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical
safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical
education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated
over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables
shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features
were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy
Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results
show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt
Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall
performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are
effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest
future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility
with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring
in educational LLMs.

### [10] [Performance Evaluation of Emotion Classification in Japanese Using RoBERTa and DeBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00013)
*Yoichi Takenaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过微调预训练语言模型，构建了一个高精度的日语文本情感检测模型，其中DeBERTa-v3-large表现最佳，并已发布为可安装的工具包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于资源稀缺和类别不平衡，日语文本的情感检测在实际应用中面临挑战，研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用WRIME语料库，将读者平均强度分数转化为二进制标签，并微调四种预训练语言模型（包括BERT、RoBERTa等），同时评估两种大语言模型（TinySwallow和ChatGPT）。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-large在准确率（0.860）和F1分数（0.662）上表现最佳，显著优于其他模型，而大语言模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 微调的DeBERTa-v3-large是目前日语情感分类的最可靠解决方案，未来需增强罕见情感数据、减小模型规模并优化大语言模型提示工程。

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and
customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese
text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the
presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores
into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT,
RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two
large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and
F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score
(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both
high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions
(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and
TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most
reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release
this model as a pip-installable package (pip install
deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions,
reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.
  This manuscript is under review for possible publication in New Generation
Computing.

### [11] [Manifold-Constrained Sentence Embeddings via Triplet Loss: Projecting Semantics onto Spheres, Tori, and Möbius Strips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00014)
*Vinit K. Chavan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过将句子嵌入约束在连续流形（如单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带）上，利用三重损失作为训练目标，以学习具有判别性和拓扑结构的嵌入。实验表明，这种方法在聚类质量和分类性能上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入通常位于无约束的欧几里得空间中，可能无法充分反映语言的复杂关系。通过将嵌入约束在流形上，可以更好地捕获语义结构。

Method: 提出了一种框架，将句子嵌入约束在单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带等流形上，使用三重损失作为训练目标。

Result: 在AG News和MBTI数据集上，流形约束嵌入（尤其是球面和莫比乌斯带上的嵌入）在聚类质量（Silhouette Score）和分类性能（Accuracy）上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 将嵌入约束在流形空间中不仅提供了语义分离，还能利用拓扑结构，为NLP中的几何表示学习提供了新的数学基础方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning have emphasized the role of
embedding geometry in capturing semantic structure. Traditional sentence
embeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit
their ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on
continuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\"obius strip
-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential
geometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning
of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.
  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare
it to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained
Keras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained
embeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\"obius strips,
significantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality
(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings
highlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological
structure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically
grounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

### [12] [Design and Application of Multimodal Large Language Model Based System for End to End Automation of Accident Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00015)
*MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury,Moazzem Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLM）和网页抓取技术的自动化系统，用于高效、准确地收集孟加拉国的道路交通事故数据，解决了传统手动收集方式的不一致性和低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在孟加拉国等发展中国家，道路交通事故数据的收集通常依赖手工操作，存在碎片化和不可靠的问题，导致数据缺失或记录不一致。研究旨在通过自动化系统解决这些挑战。

Method: 系统由四个模块组成：自动网页抓取代码生成、新闻收集、事故新闻分类与结构化数据提取、去重。使用Gemini-2.0-Flash LLM实现自动化，并通过算法确保数据完整性。

Result: 在111天内从14个新闻网站收集了超过15,000篇新闻，识别出705起独立事故。代码生成模块准确率达91.3%，验证准确率为80%。数据揭示了事故高发地区和时间段。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的自动化系统能够高效、准确地收集交通事故数据，为孟加拉国推动数据驱动的道路安全政策提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue
in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is
largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and
inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these
challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping
code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news
classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The
system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless
automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,
dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts
for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as
date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and
pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by
removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites
over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news
articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module
achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the
highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed
by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning
(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also
developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an
LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,
providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

### [13] [Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00016)
*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过SQL监督提升大语言模型在表格数据上的推理能力，并展示其在Text-to-SQL任务中的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Text-to-SQL任务过于关注查询生成，而本文希望利用SQL监督来增强模型对表格数据的通用推理能力，从而提升泛化性和可解释性。

Method: 1. 从真实SQL查询中合成详细的链式思维（CoT）轨迹，提供分步骤、分条款的监督；2. 引入Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）强化学习目标，将SQL执行准确性关联到通用推理能力。

Result: 在标准Text-to-SQL基准测试和BIRD、CRT-QA等推理密集型数据集上表现显著提升，如LLaMA模型精度提高20%，Qwen提高5%。

Conclusion: SQL不仅可作为目标形式，还能作为学习结构化数据鲁棒、可迁移推理的有效支架。

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large
language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving
beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage
framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table
reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT)
traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level
supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table
fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to
generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific
syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves
performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains
on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced
generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized
LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL
tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can
serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for
learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

Abstract: To enable precise and fully automated cell type annotation with large
language models (LLMs), we developed a graph structured feature marker database
to retrieve entities linked to differential genes for cell reconstruction. We
further designed a multi task workflow to optimize the annotation process.
Compared to general purpose LLMs, our method improves human evaluation scores
by up to 0.21 and semantic similarity by 6.1% across 11 tissue types, while
more closely aligning with the cognitive logic of manual annotation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了六种针对大语言模型（LLM）的提示压缩方法，旨在减少提示长度同时保持模型响应质量，发现在长上下文场景中压缩对性能影响更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长提示带来的计算复杂性和经济成本问题，同时保证LLM响应质量。

Method: 提出六种提示压缩方法，并在13个多样化数据集上评估其生成性能、幻觉问题等。

Result: 实验表明提示压缩对长上下文性能影响较大，适度压缩甚至在Longbench评估中提升了LLM表现。

Conclusion: 提示压缩在优化LLM效率方面具有潜力，尤其在长上下文任务中效果显著。

Abstract: Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety
of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational
complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt
compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining
LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy
in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these
methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense
QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that
prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts
compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even
enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: 该研究利用合法获取的34本O'Reilly Media书籍数据集，通过DE-COP会员推理攻击方法，调查OpenAI的大型语言模型是否未经许可使用了受版权保护的内容。结果显示，GPT-4o对收费书籍内容识别能力较强（AUROC = 82%），而GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开样本更敏感。GPT-4o Mini则无显著识别能力（AUROC ≈ 50%）。研究呼吁增加企业透明度，以建立AI训练内容的正式许可框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查OpenAI的大型语言模型是否未经许可使用了受版权保护的O'Reilly Media书籍内容，以揭示AI训练数据来源的透明度问题。

Method: 使用合法获取的34本O'Reilly Media书籍数据集，应用DE-COP会员推理攻击方法，测试多个OpenAI模型（如GPT-4o、GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4o Mini）对书籍内容的识别能力。

Result: GPT-4o对收费书籍内容表现出强识别能力（AUROC = 82%），GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容更敏感，而GPT-4o Mini无显著识别能力（AUROC ≈ 50%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了企业需提高训练数据来源的透明度，并推动建立AI内容训练的正式许可框架的必要性。

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we
apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether
OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without
consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable
model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content
(AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast,
GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible
O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge
of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$
50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for
potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results
highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding
pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for
AI content training

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合数据增强技术和Transformer模型（BERT和RoBERTa）的方法，用于解决食品危害检测中的类别不平衡问题，实验表明Easy Data Augmentation (EDA)和focal loss能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品危害检测任务面临严重的类别不平衡、文本短且非结构化、语义类别重叠等问题，影响了分类性能。

Method: 使用BERT和RoBERTa作为基础分类器，结合随机过采样、Easy Data Augmentation (EDA)和focal loss等数据平衡策略。

Result: EDA能有效缓解类别不平衡，显著提高准确率和F1分数；结合focal loss与过采样和EDA进一步增强了模型对难分类样本的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品危害检测的NLP分类模型提供了更有效的解决方案，尤其是在处理类别不平衡问题上表现优异。

Abstract: Classification tasks often suffer from imbal- anced data distribution, which
presents chal- lenges in food hazard detection due to severe class imbalances,
short and unstructured text, and overlapping semantic categories. In this
paper, we present our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 9: Food Hazard Detection,
which ad- dresses these issues by applying data augmenta- tion techniques to
improve classification perfor- mance. We utilize transformer-based models, BERT
and RoBERTa, as backbone classifiers and explore various data balancing
strategies, including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and
focal loss. Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class
imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores.
Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances
model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples. These findings
contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models
for food hazard detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合启发式和模型过滤技术的数据集构建流水线，通过合成数据生成技术提升德语预训练数据集的质量，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究表明数据质量对大型语言模型（LLM）的性能和训练效率有显著影响。为了提升德语预训练数据集的质量，作者构建了一个包含多源数据（如Common Crawl、FineWeb2和合成数据）的高质量数据集。

Method: 采用启发式和模型过滤技术构建数据集流水线，结合Common Crawl、FineWeb2和基于有机网络数据的合成数据生成技术，最终形成Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb数据集。随后预训练了1B参数的Llama风格模型和8B的无分词器分层自回归变换器（HAT），并在德语基准测试（如MMMLU）上评估。

Result: 实验表明，Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb在德语任务上表现显著优于仅使用FineWeb2的数据集，甚至在8B规模下优于加入人工高质量数据（如维基百科）的FineWeb2。

Conclusion: 研究证实了基于模型的数据筛选和合成数据生成能够显著提升预训练数据集质量，为LLM的高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet
recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and
training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline
that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic
data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a
large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web
data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual,
organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style
model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A
comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant
performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage
holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated
high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing
body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation
can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CORG的框架，用于有效处理知识库中的不一致性和复杂关联，通过分组处理上下文来解决单一方法无法全面覆盖的四种关系类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语料库中知识重复但常含不一致性（如命名模糊、过时信息或错误），语言模型难以处理这些复杂关系。

Method: 采用CORG框架，通过图构造器、重新排序器和聚合器三组件分组处理上下文。

Result: CORG在性能和效率上优于现有分组方法，接近计算密集的单上下文方法效果。

Conclusion: CORG能高效组织上下文并消歧，为复杂知识关联问题提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but
often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information,
or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous
research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities,
typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these
relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and
duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses
all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context
Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into
independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently
find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three
key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results
demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively,
outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to
more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的训练范式，通过二进制奖励优化工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性，以增强大语言模型的外部工具使用能力，避免了传统方法中的推理监督问题。实验结果表明，Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1系列模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型工具使用能力增强方法通常通过监督微调（SFT）或从更强模型蒸馏推理轨迹，但这些方法要么忽略推理过程，要么产生模仿性推理，限制了泛化能力。本文灵感来自DeepSeek-R1的成功，旨在探索一种轻量级监督方法，使模型能够自主内化推理策略。

Method: 论文提出了Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1系列模型，采用基于规则的强化学习训练范式，仅通过评估工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性的二进制奖励进行优化，避免了中间推理轨迹的监督需求。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中，基于Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct构建的Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B和Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B表现优异，超过了GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 论文提出的轻量级监督训练范式成功地增强了语言模型的工具使用能力，通过自主内化推理策略，避免了传统方法的局限性，并在多个基准测试中取得了最优效果。

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal
strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior
work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning
traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short,
either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits
generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning
through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar
training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning
traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized
with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional
correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model
to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for
annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank
benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve
state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域因专业知识壁垒、计算资源需求和部署环境限制导致大模型难以实际应用的问题。

Method: 设计知识转移管道（从70B教师模型到7B学生模型）、采用LoRA技术、实施4位权重量化和推理优化技术（如Flash Attention）。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上保持专业准确性的同时，内存消耗减少64.7%，推理延迟降低12.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境（如边缘计算设备）中的医疗大模型应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT
demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge
barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment
limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical
scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient
lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method,
systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from
three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational
optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline
is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology
is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression
level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are
implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical
reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization
techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are
integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt
to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical
question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper
maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and
inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the
application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such
as edge computing devices.

states-is fundamental to human social intelligence. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, it is crucial to assess
and enhance their capacity to interpret and respond to human mental states. In

research directions informed by recent benchmarks and state-of-the-art
approaches. Our survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers interested

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高文本操作的效率并支持自然语言查询，通过构建高质量的分类树来表示文本中的主题、动作、对象和状语及其子类关系。

Method: 通过构建独立的分类树来分别表示文本中的主题、动作、对象和状语维度，确保无冗余表示，并通过树结构的表达能力实现自然语言查询的支持。

Result: 实验结果表明，构建的抽象树在精度、召回率和F1-score上均超过80%，能够高效支持自然语言查询并快速定位目标句子。

Conclusion: 该方法通过树结构的表达能力实现了高效的文本操作和自然语言查询支持，展示了在多种查询模式下的高覆盖率和精准定位能力。

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject
dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from
texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The
high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and
adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The
independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between
trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can
be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at
least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in
natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and
F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of
subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application
of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates
that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have
high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object
and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space
to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统在自然整合非语言线索（如情感和说话人身份）和低延迟方面具有优势，但在整合外部知识方面存在挑战，尤其是语音与文本知识之间的模态差距。

Method: 提出了一种端到端的RAG框架，直接从语音查询检索相关文本知识，无需通过ASR等中间转换技术。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了端到端语音对话系统的性能，同时提高了检索效率，尽管整体性能仍落后于级联模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为端到端语音对话系统中的知识整合提供了有前景的方向，并计划公开代码和数据集以支持可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have
garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional
cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural
integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However,
these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating
external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core
difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual
knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant
textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate
speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of
end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency.
Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our
framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in
end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support
reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多领域应用中面临融入专业知识时导致的灾难性遗忘问题，需一种兼顾知识注入与基础能力保留的方法。

Method: 采用三阶段对话结构：基础保存（caption任务）、对比消歧（反事实示例）、知识专业化（思维链推理）。

Result: 实验表明，SDFT在多个领域能有效平衡专业知识学习与通用能力保留。

Conclusion: SDFT通过结构化对话模板和多轮监督框架，为领域适配提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile
capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant
limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their
training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct
adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger
catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We
introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that
effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic
forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and
subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method
employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces
pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive
Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to
maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized
information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across
multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized
knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions
include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment
with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision
framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型模拟历史时期文本的能力，以识别其可能的历史性错误（时代错位），并为社会研究提供可靠的历史视角模拟。

Method: 通过提示和微调当代语言模型，并使用自动化评判和人类评估者对比模型输出与真实历史文本。

Result: 提示无法生成符合时期风格的文本；微调后的模型能欺骗自动化评判，但人类仍能辨别其与真实文本的差异。

Conclusion: 需在时期文本上预训练模型，才能可靠模拟历史视角用于社会研究。

Abstract: Before researchers can use language models to simulate the past, they need to
understand the risk of anachronism. We find that prompting a contemporary model
with examples of period prose does not produce output consistent with period
style. Fine-tuning produces results that are stylistically convincing enough to
fool an automated judge, but human evaluators can still distinguish fine-tuned
model outputs from authentic historical text. We tentatively conclude that
pretraining on period prose may be required in order to reliably simulate
historical perspectives for social research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LEPA的新自训练算法，通过让大型语言模型在解决问题前生成抽象的计划（meta-knowledge），提升了模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅生成逐步解决方案，缺乏对跨问题通用的抽象知识的捕捉。受认知科学启发，作者希望通过生成高层次抽象计划来提升模型的泛化能力。

Method: LEPA算法分为两步：1) 基于问题生成抽象计划；2) 根据计划生成对齐的解决方案，并通过自我反思优化计划。模型同时学习预测优化后的计划和解决方案。

Result: LEPA在多项自然语言推理基准测试中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入抽象计划作为元知识，LEPA有效提升了模型对复杂问题的泛化解能力，同时减少无关细节干扰。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness
of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been
well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential
information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches
only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract
meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing
insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to
simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel
self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains
the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge
for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This
approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the
LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA
first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a
solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan
through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in
yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to
predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently
extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable
superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural
language reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症（MDD）在全球影响超过3亿人，但医疗资源分布不均和诊断方法复杂导致许多国家和地区对该疾病的关注不足。开发高效诊断工具具有重要的公共卫生意义。

Method: 研究从UK Biobank队列中选取274,348个个体记录，设计表格数据转换方法生成训练语料库，并利用微调的LLMs构建MDD-LLM框架。

Result: MDD-LLM（70B）在实验中取得了0.8378的准确率和0.8919的AUC值（95%置信区间：0.8799 - 0.9040），显著优于现有机器学习和深度学习框架。

Conclusion: MDD-LLM为抑郁症诊断提供了高效解决方案，并通过分析数据转换技术和微调策略等影响因素，为LLMs在医疗领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people
worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have
resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and
regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named
MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.
Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort
to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348
individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data
transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the
proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform
comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against
existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental
results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of
0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine
learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited
exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may

Motivation: 通过联合学习全局时变傅里叶字典和token混合系数，替代计算复杂度高的自注意力机制，以提高效率和性能。

Method: 在时间域（嵌入重建）和频域（短时傅里叶变换幅度匹配）上施加重建损失，并配以标准语言建模目标，同时用高斯混合模型（GMM）先验拟合混合向量。

Result: 在WikiText2和Penn Treebank等基准上实现了竞争力的困惑度和生成质量，计算复杂度为线性，显著降低了推理延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: 频谱字典模型可作为高效的替代方案，提供与基线Transformer竞争力相当的性能，同时大幅提升可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural
language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier
dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self
attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction
losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency
domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a
standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive
perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and
Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self
attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial
efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve
competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly
reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling
alternative for scalable language modeling.

### [30] [Improving Phishing Email Detection Performance of Small Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00034)
*Zijie Lin,Zikang Liu,Hanbo Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何通过Prompt Engineering、Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning和Model Ensemble等方法，提升小型LLM（约30亿参数）在钓鱼邮件检测任务中的性能，实验结果显示准确率从0.5提升至0.976。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型(LLMs)在自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但其庞大的参数量（数十亿级）导致计算资源需求高，难以广泛应用。研究旨在探索小型LLM（30亿参数）在钓鱼邮件检测中的可行性，并解决其性能不足的问题。

Method: 设计了三种方法：Prompt Engineering（优化输入提示）、Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning（通过解释增强微调）、Model Ensemble（模型集成），以提升小型LLM的检测能力。

Result: 在SpamAssassin数据集上，方法的有效性得到验证，将基线模型（如Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct）的准确率从约0.5显著提升至0.976。

Conclusion: 通过组合提示工程、微调优化和模型集成，小型LLM在钓鱼邮件检测中可实现接近大型模型的性能，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
natural language processing(NLP) tasks and have been employed in phishing email
detection research. However, in current studies, well-performing LLMs typically
contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous
computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the
effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs
have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However,
small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address
these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering,
Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email
detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the
SpamAssassin dataset from around 0.5 for baseline models like
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct to 0.976.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过计算框架分析了1980-2020年间3,814首嘻哈歌词的语言复杂性和社会文化趋势，揭示了词汇多样性、押韵密度和主题内容的显著变化，并发现了风格与地域和时期的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过量化分析嘻哈歌词的语言复杂性和主题演变，探讨其作为艺术形式和社会动态反映的进化过程。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术分析了3,814首歌曲，涵盖146位艺术家，时间跨度为40年，评估了词汇多样性、押韵密度、主题内容和情感极性。

Result: 研究发现词汇多样性增加了23.7%，押韵密度上升了34.2%，主题内容从社会正义转向内省，情感极性在社会政治危机期间显著下降。

Conclusion: 论文确立了嘻哈音乐作为艺术和社会动态反映的量化证据，揭示了语言创新与文化背景的互动关系。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational framework for analyzing
linguistic complexity and socio-cultural trends in hip-hop lyrics. Using a
dataset of 3,814 songs from 146 influential artists spanning four decades
(1980-2020), we employ natural language processing techniques to quantify
multiple dimensions of lyrical complexity. Our analysis reveals a 23.7%
increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists
demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density
increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the
highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified
significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing
from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6%
to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly
more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31
following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis-
tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin
(r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish
quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a
reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between
linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在说服选民方面的成本效益可能优于传统竞选手段，但目前传统方法更容易扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在民主社会中的潜在威胁，特别是其说服能力是否能以更低成本影响选民。

Method: 通过两项调查实验和一项真实世界模拟，评估LLM与选民的长期互动效果，并比较其与传统竞选手段的成本效益。

Result: LLM在说服已暴露的选民方面与传统广告效果相当，但成本更低（每说服一位选民成本为48-74美元 vs. 传统方法的100美元），然而传统方法目前更易扩展。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM当前的大规模政治说服潜力未显著超越传统方法，但随着技术发展，这种优势可能发生变化。

Abstract: In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.

### [33] [HyPerAlign: Hypotheses-driven Personalized Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00038)
*Cristina Garbacea,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于假设驱动的个性化方法（HyPerAlign），通过少量用户示例推断其沟通策略、个性和写作风格，从而为大语言模型（LLM）生成定制化输出，显著优于传统偏好微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通常基于“平均用户”偏好对齐，但实际使用中用户需求高度个性化，需要针对个体用户生成定制化响应。

Method: 提出HyPerAlign方法：通过少量用户示例推断其个性化特征（如沟通策略、写作风格），并将这些假设与用户属性结合，引导LLM生成定制化输出。

Result: 在作者归属和审慎对齐任务中，HyPerAlign显著优于偏好微调方法：审慎对齐的模型帮助性平均提升70%，作者归属性任务胜率常超90%。

Conclusion: HyPerAlign为LLM提供了一种可解释、样本高效的个性化策略，能更好地满足个体用户需求。

Abstract: Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.

Method: 改进的Graph RAG方法结合了结构化的知识图和上下文丰富的文本片段，整合层次结构和时间演化，构建更丰富的法律知识表示。

Result: 通过详细分析Graph RAG在法律规范数据集上的应用，展现了该方法在构建互联法律知识表示和提升研究效率方面的潜力。

Conclusion: Graph RAG为人工智能在法律领域的应用提供了新思路，有望在立法分析和决策支持等方面发挥重要作用。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law,
creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research,
legislative analysis, and decision support.

*Peter West,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在需要不可预测输出的任务（如随机数生成、混合策略游戏和创意写作）中，未经对齐的基础语言模型通常优于对齐后的模型。对齐模型倾向于产生狭窄的行为，导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对齐技术的普遍适用性，并验证其在需要不可预测输出任务中的局限性。

Method: 通过比较基础模型和对齐模型在随机数生成、混合策略游戏和创意写作等任务中的表现。

Result: 基础模型在这些任务中表现更好，而对齐模型因行为狭窄化导致劣势。

Conclusion: 对齐技术并非适用于所有任务，需根据具体需求权衡使用。

Abstract: Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with
techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act
safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While
these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be
universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language
models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we
study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number
generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and
creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors
that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7"
over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some
game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across
models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with
worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the
required capabilities.

Method: 采用自然语言处理技术改进情感分类方法，通过时间序列分解、因果关系模型及跨平台情感分析等方法分析Twitter数据。

Result: 情感模式与时尚主题受欢迎程度相关，尤其是可持续性和街头服饰作为主要趋势驱动因素。预测模型准确率78.35%。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情感分析在统计验证基础上能有效预测时尚趋势，为行业提供早期趋势指标。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media
sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA
(Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language
processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns
in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for
emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and
categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with
improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically
validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,
and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between
sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and
streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger
causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend
drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The
findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an
effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical
validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced
accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for
trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

Motivation: 网络迷因聚类对于毒性检测、病毒式传播建模和分类至关重要，但现有研究关注不足。由于迷因的多模态性、文化背景和适应性，现有方法依赖数据库、忽视语义，难以处理多样化的相似性维度。

Method: 采用基于模板的匹配方法，结合局部和全局特征，从形式、视觉内容、文本和身份等多维度进行相似性聚类，无需预定义数据库。

Result: 提出的方法在聚类一致性和连贯性上优于现有方法，相似性特征集支持自适应匹配，且与人类直觉一致。

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

Motivation: 解决语音识别在复杂现实场景（如远距离或情感变化）中的性能下降问题。

Method: 收集98名演员在不同环境下的语音数据，包括7种情感和不同距离，使用智能手机录制并公开数据集。

Result: ASR性能随距离和喊叫程度下降，且受情感影响；SER任务同样具有挑战性。

Conclusion: BERSt数据集揭示了语音识别系统在现实场景中的不足，需进一步改进鲁棒性。

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics.
Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with
distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the
issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance,
specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the
B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset
contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional
and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors
homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The
data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken
utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including
obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is
publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech
recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion
recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and
find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and
shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show
that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued
work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate
real-world use.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个事实一致性评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的SQL输出的语义准确性，并构建了一个特定领域的基准测试，揭示了Exaone 3.5在复杂任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本到SQL生成方面展现出潜力，但在实际商业智能应用中仍受限于语义幻觉、结构错误和缺乏特定领域评估框架。

Method: 通过构建一个包含219个自然语言商业问题的基准测试，使用Exaone 3.5模型评估语义准确性，并采用答案准确性、执行成功率等指标进行分析。

Result: Exaone 3.5在简单任务中表现良好（L1级别93%准确率），但在算术推理（H1级别4%准确率）和分组排序任务（H4级别31%准确率）中表现不佳，语义错误在复杂案例中集中。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLM在商业关键环境中的当前局限性，提出了对事实一致性验证层和混合推理方法的需求，贡献了一个可复现的评估基准和方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language
interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation.
However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts
remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack
of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a
Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of
LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM
optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark
comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity
levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery
environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a
validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer
accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.
Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple
aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in
arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),
with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.
Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as
misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping
operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in
business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency
validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable
natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated
short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how
these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our
research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the
system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract
these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods
designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these
methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such
manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority
voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against
sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models
such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing
and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the
importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure
their reliability and fairness in high-stakes settings.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application
scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks.
However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or
guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General
Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key
scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and
reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow
performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification
and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and
closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning
domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits
limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in
the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic
forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a
intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and
model will be open source.

Method: 提出一种新指标，对比模型在有上下文和无上下文条件下的回答困惑度。

Result: 实验证明该指标能有效识别回答是否基于上下文，且计算高效、可解释性强。

Conclusion: 该指标为评估开放书籍问答系统的上下文利用提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in
open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers
grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA
is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than
its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect.
Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach,
face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and
dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two
conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting
score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided
context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of
experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer
is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is
computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases,
offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in
open-book QA systems.

### [44] [Fine-Tuning LLMs for Low-Resource Dialect Translation: The Case of Lebanese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00114)
*Silvana Yakhni,Ali Chehab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译低资源黎巴嫩方言时的效果，比较了文化真实数据与大型翻译数据集的影响。实验表明，基于文化意识的较小黎巴嫩数据集（LW）微调的模型表现优于非本地大型数据，最佳结果通过对比微调和提示实现，并提出了新的评估基准LebEval。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨文化真实性对低资源方言翻译的影响，挑战“越多数据越好”的范式。

Method: 比较三种微调方法（基础、对比和语法提示）和Aya23模型，使用LW数据集和LebEval基准进行评估。

Result: 对比微调结合对比提示效果最佳，文化真实数据集表现优于大型非本地数据。

Conclusion: 文化真实性在方言翻译中至关重要，小规模但文化相关的数据集可能比大规模非本地数据更有效。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, focusing on the impact of
culturally authentic data versus larger translated datasets. We compare three
fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using
open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a
smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform
those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved
through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which
indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In
addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark
derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes
benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and
emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation.
We made our datasets and code available on Github.

*Jinyan Su,Jennifer Healey,Preslav Nakov,Claire Cardie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在推理长度和答案正确性之间存在不平衡，简单问题过度推理而复杂问题推理不足，通过缩短生成长度可保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理长度和答案正确性之间的关系，特别是长推理是否总是提升性能，以及模型是否能够根据问题难度调整推理长度。

Method: 通过系统实证研究，分析LLMs在不同难度问题上的推理长度表现，并利用偏好优化算法减少生成长度以测试其效果。

Result: 发现LLMs对简单问题过度推理，对复杂问题推理不足；通过偏好优化算法缩短长度后，仍能保持可接受的准确性。

Conclusion: 生成长度是推理行为的重要信号，未来需进一步探索LLMs在推理长度自适应中的自我意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning,
under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However,
emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy
rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study
of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find
that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long
outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it
is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty
and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization
algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer
correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly
reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight
generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate
further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了小语言模型（SLMs）在情境学习（ICL）中的性能差距，提出了AdaptMI和AdaptMI+方法，通过自适应选择技能示例来优化表现，并在数学基准测试中实现了最高6%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小语言模型（SLMs）在技能情境学习（ICL）中表现不佳的问题，特别是在简单的任务上因过度信息而导致性能下降的现象，作者希望改进这一状况。

Method: 提出了AdaptMI和AdaptMI+方法，受到人类教学中认知负荷理论的启发，AdaptMI仅在模型表现不佳时引入技能示例，而AdaptMI+则进一步针对模型缺失的具体技能添加示例。

Result: 在5-shot评估中，AdaptMI+在多个数学基准测试和五种小语言模型上比简单的技能策略提高了最高6%的准确率。

Conclusion: 自适应技能示例选择方法（尤其是AdaptMI+）能有效提升小语言模型在情境学习中的表现，尤其是在避免无用信息干扰的同时补充缺失技能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its
problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context.
Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's
(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred
to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the
model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and
five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over
naive skill-based strategies.

Motivation: 当前AI方法在放射报告分析中缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床应用的采纳。希望通过设计可解释的框架提升诊断准确性和临床信任。

Method: 结合Information Pursuit提取关键查询，Flan-T5模型判断事实存在性，分类器预测疾病，构建透明预测流程。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证了方法的有效性，展示了提升医学AI可信度和实用性的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结构化解释显著增强了AI在放射诊断中的透明度和临床适用性，为未来应用铺平道路。

Abstract: The development of AI-based methods for analyzing radiology reports could
lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis--from improving diagnostic
accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload. However, the lack of
interpretability in these methods has hindered their adoption in clinical
settings. In this paper, we propose an interpretable-by-design framework for
classifying radiology reports. The key idea is to extract a set of most
informative queries from a large set of reports and use these queries and their
corresponding answers to predict a diagnosis. Thus, the explanation for a
prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries and answers. We use
the Information Pursuit framework to select informative queries, the Flan-T5
model to determine if facts are present in the report, and a classifier to
predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance
trust and usability in medical AI.

Abstract: Despite growing global interest in Korean language education, there remains a
significant lack of learner corpora tailored to Korean L2 writing. To address
this gap, we enhance the KoLLA Korean learner corpus by adding multiple
grammatical error correction (GEC) references, thereby enabling more nuanced
and flexible evaluation of GEC systems, and reflects the variability of human
language. Additionally, we enrich the corpus with rubric-based scores aligned
with guidelines from the Korean National Language Institute, capturing
grammatical accuracy, coherence, and lexical diversity. These enhancements make
KoLLA a robust and standardized resource for research in Korean L2 education,
supporting advancements in language learning, assessment, and automated error
correction.

Method: 分析AI语言系统的一致性研究现状，探讨形式化（逻辑规则）和非形式化（道德、事实）一致性，总结现有衡量方法及研究不足。

Result: 发现一致性研究在标准化定义、多语言评估和改进方法上存在显著缺口，需强健基准和多学科协作以提升领域任务中的模型一致性。

Conclusion: 呼吁建立标准化基准和跨学科方法，确保语言模型在特定任务中兼具一致性与实用性。

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing
similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human
communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language
models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.
This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language
systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)
and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze
current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical
research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and
methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust
benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in
the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving
the utility and adaptability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming education, presenting
unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning and streamlined content
creation. However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings
necessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical
implications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from

encompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical
safeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through
its integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz
generation. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for
educators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while
upholding pedagogical and ethical standards in educational content generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关于认知扭曲的NLP研究主要基于小规模成人数据，缺乏针对青少年的研究。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提供首个针对韩国青少年的大规模数据集，以促进心理健康研究。

Method: 研究采用多LLM协商方法优化分类，并通过认知澄清（提升文本清晰度）和认知平衡（增加多样性）生成合成数据，同时通过LLMs和专家评估验证结果。

Result: LLMs在显性标记分类中表现良好，但在上下文依赖任务上准确率低于人类评估者。KoACD数据集为认知扭曲检测提供了新资源。

Conclusion: KoACD是首个针对青少年认知扭曲的大规模数据集，为未来研究奠定了基础，但LLMs在复杂推理任务上仍需改进。

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to
mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous
studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on
small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study
introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in
Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large
Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and
generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for
textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.
Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs
classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with
context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher
accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion
detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CSE-SFP的创新方法，旨在为仅解码器的生成式预训练语言模型（PLMs）提供高效的无监督句子表示框架，通过单次前向传播实现对比学习，并引入新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无监督句子表示方法主要基于判别式PLMs（如BERT），而生成式PLMs由于其参数量大，研究较少。然而，学术界和工业界的顶尖模型多以生成式架构为主，因此需要一种针对生成式PLMs的高效无监督表示框架。

Method: 提出CSE-SFP方法，利用生成式模型的结构特性，仅需单次前向传播即可完成无监督对比学习。同时引入两种比率指标，联合评估嵌入的对齐性和均匀性。

Result: 实验表明，CSE-SFP不仅能生成更高质量的嵌入，还显著减少了训练时间和内存消耗。新指标为编码模型的语义空间特性提供了更鲁棒的评估手段。

Conclusion: CSE-SFP填补了生成式PLMs在无监督句子表示领域的空白，为实际应用提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics,
sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical
applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering
systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through
unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like
BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have
attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative
PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that
state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based
on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient
unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To
address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits
the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing
strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective
unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly
reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce
two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby
providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of
encoding models.

Large Language Models for Healthcare, which took place on August 15, 2024.
Conference participants, comprising a mix of computational and clinical
expertise, attempted to discover vulnerabilities -- realistic clinical prompts
for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause
clinical harm. Red-teaming with clinicians enables the identification of LLM
vulnerabilities that may not be recognised by LLM developers lacking clinical
expertise. We report the vulnerabilities found, categorise them, and present
the results of a replication study assessing the vulnerabilities across all

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着欧盟法规数量不断增加（1952-2023年约18万条），需要一种计算方法来高效识别监管语句，以评估法规密度和严格性。过去的研究对监管语句的定义较为宽泛，本研究提供了基于制度语法工具的精确定义。

Method: 提出了两种自动识别监管语句的方法：一种是基于依赖解析的技术，另一种是基于Transformer的机器学习模型。

Result: 两种方法表现相近，依赖解析准确率80%，Transformer模型准确率84%，K alpha值为0.58。高准确率但一致性未极高，表明结合两者可能更优。

Conclusion: 研究展示了两种方法在识别监管语句上的有效性，未来可通过融合两者优势进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Identifying regulatory statements in legislation is useful for developing
metrics to measure the regulatory density and strictness of legislation. A
computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such
statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately
180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of
these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what
constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific
definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop
and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such
statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on
a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed
similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of
0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential
for combining strengths of both approaches.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, detecting hallucinated content$\unicode{x2013}$text that is not
grounded in supporting evidence$\unicode{x2013}$has become a critical
challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often
synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document
contexts and full-sentence outputs. We introduce the HalluMix Benchmark, a
diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains
and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection
systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed
source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks,
document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights
substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with
critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
implementations. Quotient Detections achieves the best overall performance,
with an accuracy of 0.82 and an F1 score of 0.84.

Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel
evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of
DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in
the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of
language models. However, the implementation details of the released models
have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication
studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by
DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training
procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated
feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design,
yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of
recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on
SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data
construction, method design and training procedure of current replication
studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and
experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future
research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting
the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and
discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help
researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements,
and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

*Makoto Sato*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLM）中的幻觉问题在实际应用中带来挑战，尤其在需要事实准确性的领域。本研究提出了一种基于提示的框架（HIP和HQP）来触发并量化幻觉，通过实验发现HIP能持续产生更不连贯和更多幻觉的响应，且不同模型的反应差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗、法律等关键领域的广泛应用，其生成的流畅但事实上不准确的输出（即幻觉）成为重要问题。理解并量化这种幻觉的认知动态是当前研究的空白。

Method: 研究者设计了两类提示：幻觉诱导提示（HIP）和幻觉量化提示（HQP）。HIP通过语义上远距离概念的误导性融合（如元素周期表与塔罗占卜）触发幻觉，HQP则对输出的合理性、自信度和连贯性进行评分。

Result: 实验发现，HIP相比对照组能显著产生更多幻觉且连贯性更差的输出。不同模型表现各异，推理导向的模型与通用模型展现出不同的幻觉特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究幻觉脆弱性提供了可重复的测试平台，并为开发能自我检测和调节概念不稳定性的更安全LLM奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge
across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual
reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,
LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.
Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains
an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to
systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing
Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,
periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a
Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,
confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple
LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more
hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied
across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from

studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,
more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of

*Jushi Kai,Boyi Zeng,Yixuan Wang,Haoli Bai,Bo Jiang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为FreqKV的新方法，通过频域压缩KV缓存来高效扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口，优化了微调和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对生成长文本至关重要，但现有方法的KV缓存内存需求线性增长且自注意力复杂度呈二次方增长，导致性能下降。

Method: 利用KV缓存在频域中能量主要集中在低频的特性，过滤高频成分，提出FreqKV技术对KV缓存进行迭代压缩，无需额外参数或架构修改。

Result: 实验表明FreqKV在长上下文语言建模和理解任务中表现高效且有效。

Conclusion: FreqKV通过频域压缩显著提升了上下文窗口扩展的效率，为长文本处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear
increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic
complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present
significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods
suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this
work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in
the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily
concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency
components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information
loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique,
FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in
the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV
introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With
minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is
compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently.
Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model
size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing
fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method
with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant
matrices and one-dimensional Fourier transforms to reduce storage and
computation costs. Experiments show that our method uses $14\times$ less number
of parameters than VeRA, $16\times$ smaller than LoRA and $32\times$ less FLOPs
than FourierFT, while maintaining close or better task performance. Our
approach presents a promising way in frequency domain to fine-tune large models

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant
computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,
domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.
Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for
domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation
when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for
deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.
FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its
ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract
domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with
domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain
essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,
these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated
datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves
highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale
state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show
that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their
original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,
applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also
improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our
approach. The code will be released.

*Zihao Wang,Yibo Jiang,Jiahao Yu,Heqing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在多角色输入场景中的角色分离问题，揭示了模型依赖的两种代理标识方法，并提出通过调整输入编码中的不变信号来提升角色分离的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多角色输入中的广泛应用，确保模型能准确区分不同角色的消息（角色分离）对保持行为一致性至关重要。然而，现有方法是否真正教会模型区分角色，还是仅记忆已知触发器，仍不明确。

Method: 通过一个简单的控制实验框架，研究发现微调模型依赖任务类型和文本起始位置作为角色标识代理。作者提出通过调整输入编码中的token-wise线索（如操纵位置ID）来强化角色边界的不变信号。

Result: 实验表明，调整位置ID能帮助模型更清晰地区分角色，减少对表面代理的依赖，从而提升角色分离的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究从机制中心视角出发，为大语言模型如何更可靠地保持多角色行为一致性提供了新思路，而非仅依赖记忆已知提示或触发器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,
system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly
prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our
work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role
behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing
logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,
and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these
differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,
to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for
understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language
models, and practically improving their performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速发展，如何提供准确且可扩展的监督反馈成为一个紧迫问题。现有LLM批判模型提供的批判过于浅显，导致判断准确性低，难以生成足够的反馈以帮助修正错误。

Method: 论文提出了一个两阶段框架：首先使用Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct生成4.5K条长式批判数据用于监督微调；随后通过强化学习（基于PRM800K人工标注数据或自动标注数据）进一步优化模型。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct构建的批判模型在多个错误识别基准上显著优于现有LLM批判模型（包括同规模的DeepSeek-R1-distill和GPT-4o），并能通过更详细的反馈有效帮助生成模型修正错误步骤。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了LLM批判模型的深度和有效性，为LLM的自动化监督提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate
feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the
same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error
identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator
refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: Memory is a fundamental component of AI systems, underpinning large language
models (LLMs) based agents. While prior surveys have focused on memory
applications with LLMs, they often overlook the atomic operations that underlie
memory dynamics. In this survey, we first categorize memory representations
into parametric, contextual structured, and contextual unstructured and then
introduce six fundamental memory operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing,
Forgetting, Retrieval, and Compression. We systematically map these operations
to the most relevant research topics across long-term, long-context, parametric
modification, and multi-source memory. By reframing memory systems through the
lens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a
structured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools
related to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based
agents while outlining promising directions for future research\footnote{The

Conclusion: 基于语域分析的提示方法为示例驱动的风格转换提供了有效解决方案，平衡了风格转换强度与语义保真度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this
ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is
rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A
key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward
high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on
register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations
across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances
style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing
prompting strategies.

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for
performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health
management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the
first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$)
trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach
employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart
rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential
equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR
observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors
as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of
precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only
the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust,
sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on
smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage
errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological
transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our
synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays
the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By
embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this
framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade
accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis
Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications.
The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the
Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the
particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis
Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the
posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and
then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the
Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees
convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of
components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births,
deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces
to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented
experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better
multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters
while using the same number of components or particles.

Motivation: Python是AI开发的常用语言，但其并行化通常依赖低层BLAS后端，导致性能和扩展性受限。作者希望通过结合HPX异步运行时模型，提升Python库的性能和扩展性。

Method: 使用pybind11将基于HPX的异步C++代码绑定到Python API，开发了并行高斯过程库GPRat。

Result: 在AMD EPYC 7742 CPU上，GPRat在64核训练中展现了优于GPyTorch和GPflow的扩展性，预测速度分别提升了7.63倍和25.25倍。在特征增加时，速度提升更加显著。

Conclusion: 异步任务在Python AI应用中具有巨大潜力，GPRat的成功证明了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial
intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow,
rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on
CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to
performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of
binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a
high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process
(GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines
the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and
scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a
mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for
varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding
overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to
GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD
EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction
speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number
of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19,
respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks
within Python-based AI applications.

Conclusion: 研究证明双保真度策略在零阶优化中的有效性，BF-SSD为大规模高维问题提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous
scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and
gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order
optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are
inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost
associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity
stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order
optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD
leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a
combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate
high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an
efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we
provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct
problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge
regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and
transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results
demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance
while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to
relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating
bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as
a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale,
high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，通过向量嵌入和注意力机制提升非肌层浸润性膀胱癌（NMIBC）复发的预测性能，在70%的准确率下超越了传统统计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NMIBC复发率高达70-80%，但现有预测工具存在缺陷，无法提供个性化管理建议。

Method: 结合向量嵌入（如吸烟状态、膀胱内治疗）和注意力机制，捕捉患者特征与复发风险的复杂关系。

Result: 模型准确率达70%，发现了新的关键因素（如手术时长和住院时间），并提供患者级别的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了预测性能，还为临床提供了患者特异性见解，弥补了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in
oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence
triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and
escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However,
existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often
overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for
patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning
framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve
NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for
categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments,
allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes
and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the
data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction
performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides
clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential
features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves
accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical
methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through
feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new
important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and
hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病是全球早逝的主要原因，但传统诊断方法因病情复杂而常失败。研究旨在利用ML和DL改进早期诊断和干预。

Method: 使用多种模型（如逻辑回归、随机森林、神经网络等），并进行数据预处理、模型训练与评估，性能指标包括精确度、召回率等。

Result: 集成方法（随机森林和梯度提升树）表现最好，神经网络在复杂数据模式中也表现优越。

Conclusion: ML和DL在慢性疾病预测中潜力巨大，但数据质量、模型可解释性等挑战仍需解决。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality
worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient
outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex
nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and
thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN),
Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease
outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including
handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation,
followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad
precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used
to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that
ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently
outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly
in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML
and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis
and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data
quality, model interpretability, and the need for advanced computational
techniques in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of
chronic diseases. This study was conducted as part of Big Data class project
under the supervision of our professors Mr. Abderrahmane EZ-ZAHOUT and Mr.
Abdessamad ESSAIDI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在大规模无监督学习中用于提取可解释特征，但计算成本高昂，尤其在需要多种尺寸SAEs时。研究旨在比较不同SAEs方法的效率与效果。

Method: 研究比较了基于子集剪枝的渐进编码与联合训练嵌套SAEs（Matryoshka SAEs）在语言建模任务中的表现。

Result: Matryoshka SAEs在重建损失、语言建模损失和表征相似性方面表现更好，而剪枝的经典SAEs更具解释性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Matryoshka SAEs在性能上的优势与经典SAEs在解释性上的优势之间的权衡，并讨论了其起源和意义。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
\citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders}
rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural
networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to
representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however,
computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially
when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary
importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding
based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or
so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs
\citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling
task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured
language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned
vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and
implications of this trade-off.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可捕捉个体特异性空间变化的流形学习框架，适用于结构化与非结构化神经影像数据，并在模拟和真实fMRI数据上验证了其优于群体基线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法通常依赖群体空间对齐或时间结构化数据，难以捕捉个体特异性的大脑功能差异。

Method: 提出一个流形学习框架，支持非时间对齐的神经影像数据，并通过模拟、自然主义fMRI数据（Sherlock和Forrest Gump）以及精神分裂症患者的静息态fMRI数据进行验证。

Result: 框架在模拟和真实数据中表现优于基线方法，能高效扩展到大规模数据，并泛化到新受试者，同时揭示了与临床相关的脑区激活模式（如基底节、感觉皮层等）。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算神经科学与临床研究提供了可扩展且个性化的脑活动建模工具。

Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on
low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain
activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual
differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods
either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is
temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because
event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can
capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and
temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two
naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework
outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and
individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales
efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test
this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data
from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our
method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with
schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework
scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen
subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal
clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal
ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation
in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings
suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific
brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and
individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in
computational neuroscience and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态制造过程的复杂特性需要先进监控和自适应控制，生成式机器学习能处理不确定性，但缺乏控制导向的视角。

Method: 提出了基于预测、直接策略、质量推断和知识集成的四种功能分类方法。

Result: 生成式机器学习在决策、过程指导、仿真和数字孪生中展现出潜力，但存在生成与控制功能分离等问题。

Conclusion: 未来应开发集成框架，结合生成式机器学习与控制技术，以应对动态制造系统的复杂性。

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by
time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These
characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing
multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to
real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative
machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex
distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing
uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic
manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to
translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls
while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification
of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated
approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced
control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML
architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties
and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional
methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing
control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and
digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between
generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of
manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To
address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at
developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control
technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing
systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对黑盒生成AI和特征编码器的专有联邦学习算法，解决了在无法优化内部参数的情况下构建专家混合模型的挑战，通过非竞争博弈论框架实现纳什均衡，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于行业标准生成AI和特征编码器多为专有黑盒，用户无法优化其内部参数，限制了专家混合模型的构建。论文旨在通过博弈论框架解决这一问题，实现专有AI的协同优化。

Method: 采用非竞争博弈论视角，提出专有联邦学习算法，每个代理在本地优化结构，通过反馈机制在线计算纳什均衡，支持预训练模型（如Transformer、随机特征模型等）。

Result: 算法在真实和合成时间序列基准测试中实现了预测精度的数量级提升，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Conclusion: 论文提出的专有联邦学习算法有效解决了黑盒AI的协同优化问题，为无法访问内部结构的场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary,
offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their
internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This
black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert
type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's
internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive
game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing
against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to
their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the
user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing
AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting,
which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between
any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI
agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning
algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their
machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain
refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature
models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning''
algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series
benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy
over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this
natural problem still being largely unexplored.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个纵向表格Transformer模型（LTT），通过利用历史停电事件数据和顺序更新，提高了恢复时间预测（ETR）的准确性，从而显著提升了客户满意度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着气候变异性增加，电力公司需要在自然灾害期间提供准确的恢复时间预测（ETR），但现有方法依赖手动评估或传统统计方法，精度不足。

Method: 提出纵向表格Transformer模型（LTT），结合历史停电事件数据和顺序更新，采用可解释性技术分析特征贡献。

Result: 在34,000次风暴相关停电事件中，LTT模型将客户满意度指标（CSI）平均提升了19.08%。

Conclusion: LTT模型不仅提高了预测精度，还增强了透明度和客户信任。

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver
precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has
become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for
enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed
decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.
Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual
assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the
level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address
these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model
that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of
these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's
performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three
major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a
2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer
Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression
metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the
outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ
interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of
incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the
contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive
approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,
fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models
have revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and
speech recognition. While server-based deployments remain the locus of peak
performance, the imperative for on-device inference, necessitated by privacy
and efficiency considerations, persists. Recognizing GPUs as the on-device ML
accelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework
that extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference
engines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which
contain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI
models. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with
cross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and
desktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly
more complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI
inference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement
relative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定的知识工程（如提示调整、上下文示例），性能提升受限于人工投入。本文旨在探索如何通过代理从自身成功经验中学习来自动提升性能。

Method: 1. 构建并优化自生成的轨迹数据库；2. 引入两种扩展（数据库级选择和范例级选择）以进一步提升性能。

Result: 方法在ALFWorld（73%→89%）、Wordcraft（55%→64%）和InterCode-SQL（75%→79%）上显著提升性能，最终达到与复杂任务特定方法相当的91%准确率。

Conclusion: 自动轨迹数据库构建能有效替代传统知识工程，为LLM代理性能提升提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential
decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as
prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and
action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the
quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate
how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning
in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than
relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and
refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a
naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test
performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),
and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent
achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two
extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to
identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection
that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as
in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving
91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific
components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory
database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive
knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional
medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern
drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value.
A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases
and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine
ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association
prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation
learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node
embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next,
the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to
enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and
robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more
accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the
model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The
results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed
existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby
indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further
revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case
studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive
retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking
experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction
and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the
Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts
ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic
information.

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial
institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of
interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To
effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow
and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize
the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations
in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural
Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous
business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the
sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a
statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each
subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local
training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated
parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature
information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show
that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence
speed than existing methods.

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging
due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface
characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical
approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often
limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research
presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning
approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM)
model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal
dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified
dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and
a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the
soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together
with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A
four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to
assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM
retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation
coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and
surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the
over-simplification in WCM.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective
human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or
guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,
strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human
skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a
strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,
the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate
player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that
human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to
improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.
Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different
skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We
then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to
estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method
achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which
increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous
state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20
matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements
in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength
estimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to
predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can
suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic
descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder
effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class
imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these
challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature
Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local
Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature
extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor
prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we
integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically
learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's
capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy
Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the
molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global
information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To
further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed
Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its
potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the
development of AI-driven technologies.

TL;DR: 论文证明了使用有限精度参数和ReLU激活函数的循环图神经网络（recurrent GNNs）在表达能力上达到了颜色细化算法（或Weisfeiler-Leman算法）的极限，且能模拟任何图算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨循环GNNs的表达能力，特别是它们在有限精度参数下的表现，以及如何通过随机初始化扩展其能力至所有图算法。

Method: 使用sum聚合和ReLU激活函数的循环GNNs，通过构造一种模拟方法，证明其能达到Weisfeiler-Leman算法的不变性限制。

Result: 循环GNNs能以多项式时间和空间开销模拟任何图算法，而随机初始化后还能模拟所有多项式时间复杂度的图算法。

Conclusion: 循环GNNs在表达能力上达到了理论极限，且通过随机初始化进一步扩展了其应用范围，为图算法的模拟提供了新方法。

Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural
Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that
recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph
algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the
color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that
the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI
2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually
reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the
power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every
graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we
construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent
GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph
algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN
with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种名为TAEGCN的新方法，通过结合时间卷积和注意力机制来捕获动态图结构中的时空特征，以提升多变量时间序列预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多变量时间序列预测方法通常假设固定的图结构，但现实中图结构是动态变化的，且时间序列在不同时间尺度下的交互关系差异显著。为了更准确地捕捉时空特征，需要一种能够处理动态图结构的方法。

Method: 论文提出了TAEGCN（Temporal Attention Evolutional Graph Convolutional Network），该方法结合因果时间卷积和多头自注意力机制学习节点的时间特征，并基于这些时间特征构建动态图结构，以保持时空特征与时间序列变化的一致性。此外，TAEGCN还通过统一的神经网络整合这些组件以生成最终预测。

Result: 实验在两个公开交通网络数据集（METR-LA和PEMS-BAY）上进行，结果表明TAEGCN在预测性能上表现优越。

Conclusion: TAEGCN通过动态图结构和时空特征的精确捕捉，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性，尤其在处理现实世界中的动态交互问题时表现出色。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states
by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes.
Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple
dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph
structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph
structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures.
Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary
significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and
spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional
Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates
causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn
temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure
based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in
spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal
relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,
TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these
components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two
public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed model.

Conclusion: 该方法通过重新设计Transformer架构，有效平衡了跨时间和跨变量依赖的建模，显著提升了多元时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is
available at this repository: https://github.com/nyuolab/Gateformer.

Motivation: 针对自注意力机制的二次计算成本问题，研究如何通过动态学习的内容稀疏性提升效率。

Method: 基于专家混合（MoE）和专家选择路由，动态为每个注意力头选择令牌，实现任意稀疏注意力模式。

Result: MoSA在相同计算预算下，困惑度最高提升27%，且训练速度更快、内存占用更少。

Conclusion: MoSA是一种高效稀疏注意力方法，性能优于密集注意力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic
cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic
attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We
hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

Motivation: CPM因模拟大量个体相互作用和偏微分方程（PDEs）描述而计算昂贵，需开发高效替代方法以加速仿真。

Method: 采用U-Net架构的CNN模型，考虑周期性边界条件，训练预测100步（MCS）的CPM动态。

Result: 替代模型比原CPM快590倍，成功复现血管生成过程中的关键行为（如出芽、延伸、吻合和腔隙收缩）。

Conclusion: 深度学习可作为CPM的高效替代模型，支持更大时空尺度的生物过程仿真。

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for
developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological
systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due
to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual
model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate
model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary
conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM
previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate
model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps,
MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to
CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively
captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts
model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction
of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning
to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster
evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater
spatial and temporal scales.

Motivation: 传统基于凸优化的方法在高维向量恢复中被证明不够高效，尤其在B较大时表现次优，因此需要一种更优且易实现的替代方案。

Method: 采用SteinSense算法，这是一种无需调参、训练数据或稀疏性先验的轻量级迭代方法，基于近似消息传递（AMP）理论。

Result: 大量实验（包括真实和合成数据）验证了SteinSense的优越性，即使在理论条件不满足时仍表现稳健。

Conclusion: SteinSense在高维向量恢复中表现出色，且易于实现和扩展，是一个有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements
rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For
about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been
synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In
the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a
straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex
Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly
when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight
iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not
have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero
knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this
makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume
of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense,
and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate
Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust,
delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under
substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Conclusion: 该框架为无线联邦学习中大模型的资源高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated
learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints
and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues
by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large
models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework
that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We
provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance
effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose
Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification
method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix
multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations.
Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA})
algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts
bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency
constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing
communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient
deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

Motivation: 当前的文本到视频生成模型虽然在美观和指令遵循上表现优异，但其输出内容常违反基本物理定律，缺乏真实性。现有评估基准多依赖像素级指标，忽略了人类判断和物理原理验证。

Method: 通过T2VPhysBench基准，采用人类评估协议和三项针对性研究（整体合规性、提示干预效果、反事实鲁棒性测试）对开源和商业模型进行系统评估。

Result: 所有模型在12类物理定律上的平均分低于0.60；提供详细提示未能显著改善违规现象；模型在明确违反物理规则的指令下仍会生成不合理的视频。

Conclusion: 当前架构在物理规则遵守上存在显著局限，未来研究需关注如何实现真正符合物理规律的视频生成。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent
years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and
accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation
and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to
respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still
violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,
and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading
content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,
pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus
overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we
introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that
systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both
open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian
mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark
employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted
studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score
below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation
revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics
violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models
often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.
The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer
concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video
generation.

Motivation: 随着模型规模的爆炸式增长，训练和微调的成本急剧上升，尤其是状态优化器的辅助信息存储需求巨大。为了降低资源消耗，提升研究的可及性，需要一种更轻量级的优化器。

Conclusion: SOLO通过极低位量化显著降低了优化器的内存需求，为解决计算资源瓶颈提供了可行方案，有望推动基础研究的普及。

Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive
training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain
auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence.
We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with
extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision
quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit
or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision
as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by
identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem
in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the
rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to
incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored
logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value
for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory
savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy
loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in
computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental
research.

Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for
effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy
Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs.
However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on
large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and
geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform
well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate
predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly
electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively
across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is
demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime
climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves
high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its
robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and
winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against
state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results
indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing
its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying
climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the
model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy
Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage
Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices
necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance
the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study
introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages
preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights,
thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed
methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability
across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our
framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the
original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In
comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only
augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential
weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical
model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven
quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization
of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental

Conclusion: R&B通过自适应语义分区与高效优化，显著提升数据混合效率与模型性能。

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in
training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.
First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task
types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving
performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of
domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via
R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity
(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data
composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients
obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for
additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or
gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and
provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to
non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and
multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B
matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when
data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based
on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream
clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this
paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm
adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity,
summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It
then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final
clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge
of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and
real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density
data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF)的新方法，通过将普通GNN转化为分层树结构，以实现多粒度的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子图的解释方法过于关注局部结构，忽略了图中长距离的依赖关系，且现有方法通常只能固定粒度压缩图结构，无法适应现实任务中多样化的粒度需求。

Method: TIF通过迭代的图粗化模块生成不同粒度的树节点，并通过图扰动模块保持节点多样性，最后利用自适应路由模块选择最具信息量的路径，提供多粒度的解释。

Result: 在合成和真实图分类基准上的实验表明，TIF在可解释性和预测性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TIF不仅提升了GNN的可解释性，还保持了与最先进方法相媲美的预测性能，验证了其多粒度解释框架的有效性。

Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying
reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific
subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable
methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking
long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that
rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability,
they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible
way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world
graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g.,
relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids,
and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like
Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are
transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs
of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a
graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees)
into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving
diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph
perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify
the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final
prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making
process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in
interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance
akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SacFL的新型联邦持续学习框架，解决了传统方法在存储资源、任务检测和对抗任务应对方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着终端设备的普及，动态数据变化和数据漂移对设备端机器学习模型提出了挑战。为解决这一问题，需要一种能保护隐私、适应数据变化并应对对抗任务的持续学习方法。

Method: SacFL采用Encoder-Decoder架构分离任务鲁棒和任务敏感组件，减少存储需求，并利用对比学习实现自主数据漂移检测，以触发持续学习或防御策略。

Result: 在多个文本和图像数据集上的实验验证了SacFL在类和域增量场景中的有效性，并通过演示系统验证了其实用性。

Conclusion: SacFL为终端设备提供了一种高效、自适应的联邦持续学习解决方案，解决了存储和对抗任务等实际挑战。

Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,
wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data
generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by
continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device
models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling
machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is
unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this
context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,
preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative
updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor
autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial
tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL
employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and
task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining
lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.
Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an
autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new
task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately
allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without
additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and
THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both
class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system
has been developed to verify its practicality.

### [101] [Learning to Estimate Package Delivery Time in Mixed Imbalanced Delivery and Pickup Logistics Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00375)
*Jinhui Yi,Huan Yan,Haotian Wang,Jian Yuan,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的多任务包裹送达时间预测模型TransPDT，通过解决多个时空因素交织、取件任务时间要求严格但数据不均衡以及快递员空间移动模式未充分探索等挑战，优化了混合物流场景下的送达时间预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混合物流场景下，快递员同时处理大量派送和少量取件任务时，取件因其更严格的时间限制对快递员决策行为影响更大。现有研究未充分区分派送与取件的决策影响，导致预测不足。

Method: 提出TransPDT模型：1) 使用Transformer编码器捕捉快递员历史路径和待处理包裹集的时空依赖；2) 设计模式记忆模块通过注意力机制学习不均衡数据中的取件模式；3) 将路径预测作为送达时间预测的辅助任务，并融入快递员空间移动先验规律。

Result: 在真实工业级数据集上验证了模型优越性，并部署于京东物流系统，支持北京地区每日数十万包裹的追踪。

Conclusion: TransPDT通过多任务学习和时空模式建模，显著提升了混合物流场景下的送达时间预测精度，具备实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics
industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service
guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where
couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup
simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and
delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the
pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the
delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three
main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately
interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups
have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it
challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'
spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,
but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,
a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first
employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal
dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.
Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the
imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as
an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior
courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on
real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A
system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more
than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in
Beijing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DQN在强化学习中取得了重大突破，但其理论分析仍然有限。本文旨在通过连续系统的视角，深入理解DQN的关键技术。

Method: 构建基于DQN的SDDE方程，使用改进的Lindeberg原理和算子比较方法，估计Wasserstein-1距离并证明其收敛性。

Result: 提供了距离的上界，并证明随着步长趋近于零，距离也趋近于零。延迟项（对应目标网络）增强了系统稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究从连续系统角度解释了DQN的经验回放和目标网络技术，为理论分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has
brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In
this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based
on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We
provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the
two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us
to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target
network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay
term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the
stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle
and an operator comparison to establish these results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束OCO方法允许偶尔的安全违规，而本研究旨在在约束逐渐演变的假设下（即约束在连续轮次间变化不大），首次实现严格的安全性保证。

Method: 采用原始对偶方法和对偶空间的在线梯度上升法，并通过二元学习率确保安全性和亚线性遗憾。

Result: 研究证明了在动态约束变化下，可以实现零约束违背，同时保持亚线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 该框架是首个在OCO中面对变化约束时提供绝对安全性可证明保证的方法，标志着与之前工作的显著不同。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in
Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic
constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow
for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining
strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely
the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds.
This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in
the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables
ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our
framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable
guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints
in OCO.

TL;DR: 论文提出DeepSTA模型，通过异常时空学习模块和异常模式注意力模块，提升物流行业在异常情况下（如疫情）的配送准时率预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物流行业需提前预测配送准时率以采取预防措施，尤其在异常事件（如疫情）中，现有研究因未显式建模异常事件且数据不足，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 设计异常时空学习模块（RNN建模事件信息）、利用Node2vec建模道路区域关联、结合图神经网络和LSTM捕捉时空依赖性，并通过记忆网络存储异常特征模式。

Result: 在2022年新冠疫情真实数据集上，DeepSTA的MAE和MSE分别优于基线12.11%和13.71%。

Conclusion: DeepSTA通过显式建模异常事件和解决数据不足问题，显著提升了异常场景下的配送准时率预测性能。

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the
logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure
the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical
during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'
delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.
Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many
works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly
model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other
features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous
events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in
these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal
attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we
design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent
neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec
to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks
and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of
couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal
circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a
memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention
mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the
COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by
12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over
multiple competitive baselines.

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk
via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a
significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its
asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert
fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting
and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with
the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest
accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision
(0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI
approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to
elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates
that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed
by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate
clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The
research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning
models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on
the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further
research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of
supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法在多源域和新目标域中泛化能力不足，CICADA旨在填补这一研究空白，提高跨域异常检测的性能和可解释性。

Method: CICADA采用混合专家框架捕获域无关异常特征，选择性元学习防止负迁移，自适应扩展算法支持新域扩展，分层注意力结构增强可解释性。

Result: 在合成和真实工业数据集上的实验表明，CICADA在跨域检测性能和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CICADA通过创新的技术组合有效解决了跨域异常检测的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in
applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant
challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which
are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing
models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and
emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce
CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and
Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE)
framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility
and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent
negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion
algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical
attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to
enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and
interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for
regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based
multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual
information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates
a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a
self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision.
Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach
achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming
text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard
multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3
percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1,
suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under
limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary
benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies
can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test

validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set
dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and
feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior,
generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in
coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation
improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

Conclusion: 该框架为属性驱动的机器学习提供了通用方法，支持灵活的安全性和正确性约束，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety
and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for
training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial
training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within
$\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems
and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region
specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable
logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss
terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In
this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be
unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show
that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general
approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study
involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is
publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting
outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input
signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but
also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics
of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing
transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer
that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The
multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original
transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not
only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions
between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation
in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the
sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and
the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted
by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state
correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD
state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize
actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its
operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve
this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that
concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their
density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe
decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our
proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline
MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

Method: 采用自消融机制动态强制执行k-winner-takes-all约束，促进神经元和注意力单元的选择性激活。

Result: 实验显示自消融导致更局部化的电路、集中的特征表示和增强的神经元专业化，语言模型性能未受影响。

Conclusion: 研究发现全局稀疏性减少与局部专业化增强可共存，从而提高模型解释性，揭示了稀疏性与解释性之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: A growing intuition in machine learning suggests a link between sparsity and
interpretability. We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate
this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach
dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to
demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike
post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates
interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization
from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing
interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized
circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron
specialization without compromising language modelling performance.
Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that
self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This
reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where
decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization,
leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make
our code available at

### [114] [Leveraging Partial SMILES Validation Scheme for Enhanced Drug Design in Reinforcement Learning Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00530)
*Xinyu Wang,Jinbo Bi,Minghu Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PSV-PPO的新RL算法，通过实时部分SMILES验证解决了药物发现中深度强化学习的灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持了高探索性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物发现中的RL方法（如REINVENT）在保留预训练知识时缺乏稳健的探索机制，导致灾难性遗忘问题，尤其是分子有效性的大幅下降。

Method: 提出PSV-PPO算法，通过逐步验证每个自回归步骤的部分SMILES，提前检测无效路径，从而在探索化学空间时保持高有效性率。

Result: 在PMO和GuacaMol基准数据集上的实验表明，PSV-PPO显著减少了无效结构的生成，同时保持了竞争性的探索和优化性能。

Conclusion: PSV-PPO不仅解决了灾难性遗忘问题，其框架还可扩展至其他领域知识，进一步推动强化学习在药物发现中的应用。

Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug
discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)
has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high
matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a
critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL
phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\%
during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied
in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian
pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To
address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a
novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to
prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike
traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after
generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each
auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also
all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables
early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a
result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive
exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol
benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of
invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and
optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining
validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to
incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing
reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

*Linjing You,Jiabao Lu,Xiayuan Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA)的方法，通过在高置信度实例和测试实例之间对齐相关性来提升测试性能，并提出了两种简单高效的算法LinearTCA和LinearTCA+。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时适应(TTA)方法存在实例对齐为主忽视相关性对齐、复杂的反向传播操作导致计算开销以及域遗忘等问题。为解决这些问题，论文探索了测试时相关性对齐的可行性。

Method: 论文提出了两种算法：LinearTCA通过简单的线性变换实现实例和相关性对齐，无需额外模型更新；LinearTCA+作为即插即用模块提升现有TTA方法效果。

Result: 实验表明，TCA方法在多种任务、基准和骨干网络上显著优于基线方法，例如在OfficeHome数据集上准确率提升5.88%，且仅占用4%的最大GPU内存和0.6%的计算时间。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论和实验验证了测试时相关性对齐的有效性，为实际应用中的轻量级、高效TTA方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution
shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a
solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world
scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),
which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA
methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise
alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source
correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,
resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate
the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that
correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can
enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we
propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.
LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and
correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves
as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive
experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods
significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and
backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on
OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6%
computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

TL;DR: KnowEEG是一种新型可解释的机器学习方法，用于EEG分类，通过特征提取和随机森林改进，性能媲美深度学习，同时提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG分类中的深度学习模型缺乏解释性，KnowEEG旨在解决这一关键问题，特别是在医疗等领域需要可解释性的场景。

Method: KnowEEG提取电极特征，通过统计测试过滤并整合电极间连接性特征，使用改进的随机森林模型（Fusion Forest）进行分类。

Result: 在情绪检测、脑力负荷分类、睁闭眼检测、异常EEG分类和事件检测等任务中，KnowEEG性能达到或超越最先进的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: KnowEEG不仅性能优越，还通过特征重要性分数提供可解释性，证明其在EEG分析中的实际应用价值，尤其在医疗领域。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that
shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification
to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep
learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability
remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce
KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.
KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them
using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity
statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model
(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode
connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating
knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,
KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep
learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,
mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG
classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG
provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for
understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open
classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge
about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed
classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.
Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG
explainability is critical such as healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DFBT的新方法，直接预测状态以避免递归方法中的误差累积，显著提高了强化学习在延迟环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有递归预测方法在强化学习中存在误差累积问题，影响性能。需要一种直接预测状态的方法来减少这种误差。

Method: 引入DFBT方法，直接从观测值预测状态，避免逐步估计中间状态，减少了误差累积。

Result: 实验显示DFBT在D4RL离线和MuJoCo基准测试中显著优于现有方法，预测精度高且学习效率提升。

Conclusion: DFBT通过直接预测状态有效解决了递归方法的误差累积问题，为延迟环境中的强化学习提供了更优解。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions
lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of
its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause
the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel
belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT),
directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating
intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT
greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods,
yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline
datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy.
DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step
bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo
benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

Motivation: 基础模型虽然在多个领域取得了成功，但其巨大的计算和存储复杂度使得实际应用中调参困难。

Method: 使用交错循环和对角矩阵的乘积进行因式分解，并针对非方形微调权重进行分块处理，避免了权重变化矩阵的构建，使用1D快速傅里叶变换替代2D FFT。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种任务上表现相似或更好，同时显著减少了FLOPs和可训练参数数量。

Conclusion: 通过傅里叶域的因式分解方法，可以有效降低基础模型的调参复杂度，提升实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains.
However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models
difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows
training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of
both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we
propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the
product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address
the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix
into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and
utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental
results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across
various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number
of trainable parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AiT的新型模型，用于解决不规则多元时间序列预测中的动态权重调整和变量相关性建模问题，显著提高了预测精度并降低了运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的不规则多元时间序列（采样间隔可变且存在缺失值）会导致传统线性网络的静态权重建模效果不佳。因此，需要一种能动态调整权重并高效建模变量相关性的方法。

Method: AiT采用自适应线性网络动态调整权重以解决序列内不一致性问题，同时结合Transformer模块的变量语义嵌入捕获变量相关性，避免序列间异步问题。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，AiT比现有方法预测精度提升11%，运行时间减少52%。

Conclusion: AiT通过动态权重和Transformer模块有效解决了不规则多元时间序列的建模难题，显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various
industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.
Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational
cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing
research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate
time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular
multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and
missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series
asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with
traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these
challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an
adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to
observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby
enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by
incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT
efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of
inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by
11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 传统空间统计方法虽广泛使用，但机器学习因其‘黑箱’特性而受限。XAI通过解释模型输出，能提升透明度和可靠性，满足空间分析的需求。

Method: 采用Shapley值等XAI方法，结合空间分析技术，以2020年美国总统选举的县级投票行为为例进行实证研究，并对比多尺度地理加权回归。

Result: 研究展示了XAI（尤其是Shapley值）在空间分析中的有效性，但也揭示了当前技术的局限。

Conclusion: 尽管XAI在空间分析中潜力巨大，仍需解决技术挑战，并探索新方向以进一步提升其应用效果。

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in
spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes
to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on
spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable
and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been
increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine
learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our
understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI
has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the
output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding.
These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the
reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter
introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based
approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their
integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting
behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use
of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale
geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on
the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new
directions.

Result: Transformer架构模型比HyenaDNA更鲁棒，对抗攻击常针对生物学重要区域，表明模型能有效捕捉序列特征。

Conclusion: GERM为GFM对抗脆弱性提供了系统分析框架，揭示了架构设计对鲁棒性的重要性，并验证了模型捕捉生物特征的能力。

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic
Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM
offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess
the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate
the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely
adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our
benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM
vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and
training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater
robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the
impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Conclusion: 证明了对比学习在处理高维、异质性组学数据中的潜力，有助于发现生物学见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a
significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce
OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds
heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and
miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a
survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn
representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on
labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers
clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance
with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across
hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype
coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating
survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned
embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for
biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Result: 在 DeepMind Control Suite 和磁约束聚变任务中，WPO 表现优于现有最先进的连续控制方法。

Conclusion: WPO 提供了一种高效、通用且性能优越的连续控制强化学习算法，适用于多种动作分布的策略。

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm
for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as
an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies
projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a
neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update.
The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic
policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits
knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the
action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies
with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the
reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a
magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art
continuous control methods.

Method: 创建MINERVA数据集，包含5个答案选项和详细的手工制作推理轨迹，涵盖多样视频领域和复杂多步问题。

Result: 数据集对前沿开源和专有模型构成挑战，错误分析表明主要失败模式为时间定位和视觉感知错误。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most
video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or
interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models
are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about
videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic
biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA
for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer
choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is
multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of
complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset
provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We
perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across
various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to
explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning
traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal
localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or
completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and
reasoning traces will be publicly available under

Conclusion: 正态化归一化是一种有效的归一化方法，适用于多种模型和数据集，并能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at
the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the
greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an
equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions.
Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of
deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their
effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what
distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved,
been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal
distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality
normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the
feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and
employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments
comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in
regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and
dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of
variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its
suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally
used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical
developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their
technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying
theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,
especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose
a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the
technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic
feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing
contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents
to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical
Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy
methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative
paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving
equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a
forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.
Together, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of
human cognition and AI capability.

Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in
particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of
the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this
anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as
found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined
with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities,
relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is
then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are
given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of
relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is
proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and
diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in

*Ilan Strauss,Isobel Moure,Tim O'Reilly,Sruly Rosenblat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过对2020年1月至2025年3月的9,439篇生成式AI论文中的1,178篇安全和可靠性论文的分析，研究发现企业AI研究主要集中在部署前的模型对齐和测试评估，而对部署阶段的模型偏见等问题的关注减少。高风险部署领域（如医疗、金融、错误信息等）存在显著研究空白。建议扩大外部研究人员对部署数据的访问并系统性观察市场AI行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在比较领先AI企业和大学在安全和可靠性研究上的差异，揭示企业AI研究在部署前后的关注点变化，以及高风险领域的知识缺口。

Method: 分析了1,178篇安全和可靠性论文，时间跨度为2020年1月至2025年3月，涵盖9,439篇生成式AI论文，聚焦企业和大学的研究输出。

Result: 企业研究更集中于部署前的模型对齐和测试评估，部署阶段的议题如模型偏见关注减少。高风险领域（如医疗、金融等）研究不足。

Conclusion: 建议改进部署AI的可观测性，扩大外部研究人员对部署数据的访问，以避免企业集中造成的知识缺口扩大。

Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI
papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI
companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI
universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of
Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on
pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while
attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant
research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare,
finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and
copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate
concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external
researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market
AI behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个系统化的RAIL框架，通过八个可衡量的维度评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的规范性行为，并应用在Anthropic的数据集上，以洞察其伦理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI伦理框架缺乏可操作的评价方法，因此需要建立一个更系统化的评估体系，以确保AI系统的伦理标准。

Method: 使用RAIL框架，通过八个可衡量维度评估LLMs的行为，并应用在Anthropic的“Values in the Wild”数据集上进行分析。

Result: 研究通过RAIL框架对数据集进行了映射和评分，揭示了LLMs在现实应用中的伦理行为表现。

Conclusion: RAIL框架提供了一个有效的工具，能够系统化地评估和提升AI系统的伦理行为，尤其在LLMs的规范性评估中表现出实用性。

Abstract: As AI systems become embedded in real-world applications, ensuring they meet
ethical standards is crucial. While existing AI ethics frameworks emphasize
fairness, transparency, and accountability, they often lack actionable
evaluation methods. This paper introduces a systematic approach using the
Responsible AI Labs (RAIL) framework, which includes eight measurable
dimensions to assess the normative behavior of large language models (LLMs). We
apply this framework to Anthropic's "Values in the Wild" dataset, containing
over 308,000 anonymized conversations with Claude and more than 3,000 annotated
value expressions. Our study maps these values to RAIL dimensions, computes
synthetic scores, and provides insights into the ethical behavior of LLMs in
real-world use.

### [130] [DeCo: Defect-Aware Modeling with Contrasting Matching for Optimizing Task Assignment in Online IC Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00278)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Yu-Hao Chiang,Yi-Tung Tsai,Hsu-Chao Lai,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeCo是一种创新方法，通过构建缺陷感知图和工程师任务表示优化IC测试任务分配，提升效率和工作负载平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究忽视了缺陷特征、历史故障和工程师专业知识的整合，导致IC处理效率受限。DeCo旨在利用AI解决这些问题。

Method: DeCo构建缺陷感知图以增强缺陷区分能力，并基于工程师和任务的表示，结合对比匹配机制分配任务。

Result: 实验表明DeCo在不同场景下任务处理成功率超过80%，且能平衡工作负载，即使面对稀缺数据也能有效分配任务。

Conclusion: DeCo展示了作为AI驱动解决方案的潜力，能高效处理IC测试任务并适应实际工业需求。

Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital
role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements
in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right
engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies
emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the
integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights
from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC
handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative
approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel
defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships
to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally,
it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced
by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a
contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by
considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable
and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different
scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both
scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can
assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar
defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world
IC failure analysis and task handling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过分析游戏数据（如玩家动作、点击流等）挖掘玩家行为和风格，从而更好地理解玩家心理、体验和成长需求。

Method: 采用两阶段深度神经网络CognitionNet：第一阶段挖掘游戏行为作为潜在空间的聚类表示，第二阶段通过监督分类目标聚合这些微模式以发现玩家的游戏风格。通过“桥接损失”实现双目标协同训练。

Result: CognitionNet在玩家心理和战术挖掘方面表现优异，显著优于现有基线方法，并能提供玩家参与预测的相关诊断解释。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了从游戏遥测数据中自动化挖掘玩家心理和战术的目标，为玩家行为分析和体验优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at
the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in,
e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is
rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help
create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her
impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this
knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted
player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards
players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on
discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous
sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a
sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We
propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses
on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while
the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a
supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual
objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired
decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and
one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player
psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic
explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of
the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel
formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining
homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms
the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

Motivation: 传统方法在动态复杂环境中面临可扩展性和资源整合的挑战，研究旨在通过LLM增强UAM的适应性和韧性。

Method: 采用全息架构和LLM，处理自然语言输入、生成自适应计划并管理突发情况，实现去中心化控制。

Result: 通过多模式交通案例（电动滑板车和空中出租车）验证了动态资源分配和实时重新规划的能力。

Conclusion: 该架构为韧性、以人为中心的UAM生态系统奠定了基础，未来将探索混合AI集成和实际验证。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces
challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution.
Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability,
and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This
paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large
Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi
autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground
transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate
adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace
closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric
scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic
resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without
centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation
networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this
work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with
future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.

Method: 提出ScaleTrack框架，包括统一模板收集多样GUI样本和设计回溯历史动作的训练策略。

Result: 实验证明ScaleTrack能有效解释GUI图像与动作的对应关系，并描述GUI环境的演化规则。

Conclusion: ScaleTrack通过改进GUI定位和规划，提升了自动化GUI代理的性能，数据和代码将公开。

Abstract: Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically
performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop
devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate
executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.
Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which
the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the
task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on
historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of
insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of
backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above
challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding
and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI
samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and
unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.
Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action
from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that
led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence
between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules
of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.

Abstract: Agentic AI, with its autonomous and proactive decision-making, has
transformed smart environments. By integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and
multi-agent systems, modern AI frameworks can dynamically adapt to user
preferences, optimize data management, and improve resource allocation. This
paper introduces UserCentrix, an agentic memory-augmented AI framework designed
to enhance smart spaces through dynamic, context-aware decision-making. This
framework integrates personalized Large Language Model (LLM) agents that
leverage user preferences and LLM memory management to deliver proactive and
adaptive assistance. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid hierarchical control
system, balancing centralized and distributed processing to optimize real-time
responsiveness while maintaining global situational awareness. UserCentrix
achieves resource-efficient AI interactions by embedding memory-augmented
reasoning, cooperative agent negotiation, and adaptive orchestration
strategies. Our key contributions include (i) a self-organizing framework with
proactive scaling based on task urgency, (ii) a Value of Information
(VoI)-driven decision-making process, (iii) a meta-reasoning personal LLM
agent, and (iv) an intelligent multi-agent coordination system for seamless
environment adaptation. Experimental results across various models confirm the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing response accuracy, system
efficiency, and computational resource management in real-world application.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了法律领域分类器模型的形式框架，引入了事实与规则（尤其是判决理由）的结合，改进了现有仅基于事实的分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器框架仅通过案件事实进行特征化，而法律推理需要同时考虑事实与规则（如判决理由），因此需扩展框架以更贴近实际法律推理。

Method: 基于Canavotto等人（2023）的规则推理模型，将规则集整合到分类器中，并通过案例推断决策。新增时间因素和法院层级作为框架用例。

Result: 展示了新分类器框架如何推断新案例的决策，并通过时间和法院层级的应用验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: 扩展后的分类器框架更贴近法律实践，为法律推理提供了更全面的建模工具。

Abstract: We extend the formal framework of classifier models used in the legal domain.
While the existing classifier framework characterises cases solely through the
facts involved, legal reasoning fundamentally relies on both facts and rules,
particularly the ratio decidendi. This paper presents an initial approach to
incorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work
of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of
precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how
decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based
classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time
element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier
framework.

*Phanish Puranam,Prothit Sen,Maciej Workiewicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT4 在类比推理中能提供高召回率但低精确度，而人类则相反；研究表明人类在深度结构相似性识别上有优势，AI 更适合作为广泛的类比生成工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如 GPT4）能否在战略决策的类比推理中匹配人类能力，并明确各自优劣势。

Method: 采用新型实验设计（从源到目标的匹配任务），比较 GPT4 与人类在类比推理中的表现差异。

Result: GPT4 能检索所有可能的类比（高召回率），但常因表面相似性选择错误类比（低精确度）；人类则能精准选择因果对齐的类比（高精确度），但覆盖较少（低召回率）。

Conclusion: 类比推理需分阶段：AI 适合生成候选类比，而人类更适合精确评估，二者协作可优化决策。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can
match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision
making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target
matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible
analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect
analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants
exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with
stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying
matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that
requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs
are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative
advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error
analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas
human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together,
the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted
organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy
generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most
contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了MCTS的可解释性，为复杂AI算法的透明化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In response to the lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
sequential planning, we design a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language
model (LLM)-based natural language explanation framework designed for the Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is often considered challenging to
interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is
flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and
knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and
variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the
search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental
dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We
evaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it
demonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.

Motivation: 生成式AI模型的评估面临严重挑战，包括输入输出空间无限、缺乏明确真值目标、存在反馈循环和预测依赖等问题，其中泄漏和污染问题最为关键。

Result: AI竞赛在防泄漏方面已有有效方法，可作为生成式AI评估的借鉴资源。

Conclusion: 生成式AI领域应重视AI竞赛的实践经验，提升评估的严谨性和有效性。

Abstract: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI
is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking
strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models
and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these
models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do
not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong
feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model
outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em
leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult
issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI
Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage
for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition
setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized)
resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold
standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest
their results with according value.

Conclusion: FPoTT证明了开源LLM在实现安全、自适应和可扩展车联网管理中的潜力，为智能交通生态系统提供了替代专有解决方案的可行选择。

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and
privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often
suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to
widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive
environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular
systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and
effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel
framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT
introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines
textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a
dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for
real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A
Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training
with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation
(NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing
EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data
while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results
underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and
scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary
solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

also present an efficient and differentiable $O(d^3)$ algorithm to compute the
parameters of the inverse BLT matrix, where $d$ is the degree of the original
BLT (typically $d < 10$). Our characterization enables direct optimization of

Abstract: This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an
analytical study of a dataset using the DeepMIMO emulator. An advertorial
attack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A
comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of
detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of
the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks,
during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is
shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an
increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2
indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively
identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression
machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid
analysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it

### [143] [On the expressivity of deep Heaviside networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00110)
*Insung Kong,Juntong Chen,Sophie Langer,Johannes Schmidt-Hieber*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 深度Heaviside网络（DHN）表达能力有限，但通过添加跳跃连接或线性激活神经元可以克服这一限制。论文还提供了这些网络类的VC维和近似率的下界和上界，并应用于非参数回归模型中DHN拟合的统计收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度Heaviside网络的表达能力局限性及其改进方法，以提升它们在统计学习任务中的实用性。

Method: 通过理论分析，提出添加跳跃连接或线性激活神经元的改进方法，并计算VC维和近似率的上下界。

Result: 证明改进后的DHN具有更强的表达能力和更优的理论性能。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接或线性激活神经元能显著提高DHN的表达能力，为其在非参数回归等任务中的应用提供理论支持。

Abstract: We show that deep Heaviside networks (DHNs) have limited expressiveness but
that this can be overcome by including either skip connections or neurons with
linear activation. We provide lower and upper bounds for the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimensions and approximation rates of these network
classes. As an application, we derive statistical convergence rates for DHN
fits in the nonparametric regression model.

with a given topology in terms of the max-plus algebra by taking its logarithm.
Then, we show that an estimator of a parameter for each edge in a directed
acyclic graph (DAG) is distributed normally. We end this paper with
computational experiments with the expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm

*Yuhan Li,Eugene Han,Yifan Hu,Wenzhuo Zhou,Zhengling Qi,Yifan Cui,Ruoqing Zhu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在存在未测量混杂因素的情况下，针对连续动作空间的离线策略学习方法，通过非参数估计和极小极大估计器优化策略价值，并在理论和实践中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）中的策略评估，并假设动作空间是离散的。本文旨在解决连续动作空间中的离线策略学习问题，尤其是在未测量混杂因素存在时的挑战。

Method: 论文首先建立了一个新的非参数策略价值识别结果，随后开发了一个极小极大估计器，并提出了一种基于策略梯度的算法，以找到在类内最优的策略。

Result: 通过理论分析，证明了所得最优策略的一致性、有限样本误差界和遗憾界。在德国家庭面板数据的实际应用中进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在理论和实践中均表现出色，为解决连续动作空间中的离线策略学习问题提供了有效工具，尤其是在存在未测量混杂因素的情况下。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in
reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured
confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy
evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and
assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel
identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value
for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this
identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a
policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that
maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound
of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world
application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methodology.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了利用预后因素预测治疗效果异质性的预训练策略，结合R-learner框架，通过交叉任务学习提高条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在个性化医疗等领域的决策中，准确估计异质性治疗效果是一大挑战，尤其在存在大量协变量的情况下。

Result: 实验表明该方法能降低估计误差、减少假发现率、提高异质性检测能力。

Conclusion: 通过交叉任务学习可更准确地识别信号，尤其适用于预后因素与治疗效应存在协同效应的场景。

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental
challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized
medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning
has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible
effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many
covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a
phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the
outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In
medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways
frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically,
we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the
CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We
use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that
can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In
settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables
more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false
discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

*Giorgio Spadaccini,Marjolein Fokkema,Mark A. van de Wiel*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了RuleSHAP框架，结合稀疏贝叶斯回归、树集成和Shapley值，用于流行病学中的假设无关风险因子发现与测试，改进了复杂模式的检测与推断效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习在流行病学中的应用虽然能发现非线性关系与交互作用，但缺乏可靠的推断方法。现有局部特征效应度量（如树集成结合SHAP值）的统计不确定性量化不足，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出RuleSHAP框架：通过单步整合稀疏贝叶斯回归、树集成与Shapley值，支持个体层面的复杂模式检测与统计检验，并推导了边际Shapley值的快速计算公式。

Result: 在模拟数据中验证了框架有效性，并在真实流行病学队列数据中成功检测出年龄、性别、BMI等特征对高胆固醇和血压的非线性交互影响。

Conclusion: RuleSHAP为机器学习驱动的流行病学研究提供了可解释且可推断的工具，解决了传统方法在统计不确定性和计算效率上的局限。

Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for
hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is
strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently
compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature
effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for
these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory.
We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free
discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley
values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at
the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes
marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the
validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our
machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several
effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction
effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文探讨了贝叶斯最优公平分类器在多敏感特征下的适用性，提出了基于近似公平度量和线性变换的框架，并设计了两种实用算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯最优公平分类器研究通常只考虑单一敏感特征，而实践中个体常涉及多敏感特征。针对这一局限，本文旨在扩展贝叶斯最优公平分类器理论，提出适用于多敏感特征的解决方案。

Method: 通过分析近似公平度量（如均值差异和均值比）的线性变换性质，构建了基于组别选择率的理论框架，并推导出实例依赖的阈值规则。此外，设计了两种算法（处理中和后处理）实现贝叶斯最优公平分类。

Result: 理论分析表明，多敏感特征下贝叶斯最优公平分类器表现为加权组别概率的阈值规则。实验验证了所提算法在公平性和性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文为多敏感特征场景提供了通用的贝叶斯最优公平分类框架，并通过算法实现验证了其有效性，为公平机器学习领域贡献了新思路。

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers
a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined
by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the
Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general
approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We
show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions,
including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and
Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific
groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become
instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these
group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware
and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions
like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for
Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We
show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

### [149] [D-Tracker: Modeling Interest Diffusion in Social Activity Tensor Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00242)
*Shingo Higashiguchi,Yasuko Matsubara,Koki Kawabata,Taichi Murayama,Yasushi Sakurai*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为D-Tracker的方法，用于从社交活动张量数据流中发现时间变化模式并预测未来活动，具有可解释性、自动化和可扩展性，且在实验中表现出更高的预测准确性和更短的计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交活动数据（如每周网络搜索量和传染病新增感染人数）反映了人们的兴趣和活动，但由于数据高维且包含多种时间变化动态（如趋势、季节性和兴趣扩散），建模和预测这类数据流具有挑战性。

Method: D-Tracker方法将偏微分方程融入张量分解框架，以可解释的方式捕捉时间变化模式（如趋势、季节性和位置间的兴趣扩散），且无需超参数，完全自动建模数据流，计算时间与时间序列长度无关。

Result: 使用GoogleTrends的搜索量数据和COVID-19开放数据仓库的感染数据进行的实验表明，D-Tracker在预测准确性和计算时间上优于现有方法，并能提取位置间的兴趣扩散。

Conclusion: D-Tracker是一种高效、自动且可扩展的方法，适用于从高维社交活动数据流中提取时间变化模式并进行预测。

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes
and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples'
interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from
such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and
forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are
high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends,
seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a
method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social
activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed
method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the
partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and
captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and
interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic:
it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully
automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent
of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained
from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data
Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less
computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion
between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at

### [150] [Evaluating the AI-Lab Intervention: Impact on Student Perception and Use of Generative AI in Early Undergraduate Computer Science Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00100)
*Ethan Dickey,Andres Bejarano,Rhianna Kuperus,Bárbara Fagundes*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过结构化引导（如AI-Lab模块），学生能更理性地使用生成式AI（GenAI），提升对工具的理解和应用能力，而不会削弱核心技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式AI在教育中的影响，尤其是如何通过结构化引导避免学生对工具的过度依赖。

Method: 在多个课程中引入AI-Lab模块，结合混合方法分析学生使用模式和态度变化。

Result: 学生在调试和作业中更谨慎地使用GenAI，舒适度和开放性显著提升。

Conclusion: 结构化引导能帮助学生在教育中合理利用GenAI，未来需进一步研究其教学支持潜力。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its
effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain
underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on
structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines
the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided
scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data
Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering
courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and
elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey
responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods
approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as
well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming
projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and
openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage
patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting
students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions
corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap"
between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools
into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill
development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable
students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential
competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to
integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for
future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了将心理学理论应用于大语言模型（LLMs）的六个关键维度，包括评估工具、数据集、评价指标、实证发现、人格模拟方法和行为模拟，指出了当前方法的优缺点，并提出了未来发展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类中心任务中的广泛应用，评估其心理特质对理解社会影响和确保AI可信对齐至关重要。现有研究未系统讨论心理学测试、LLM专用数据集及其应用，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统综述六个维度（评估工具、数据集、评价指标等），分析现有方法的优缺点，并提出方法论挑战。

Result: 研究发现某些LLMs在特定提示下表现出可复现的人格模式，但任务和设置间的变异性显著。现有工具与LLMs能力不匹配，评估实践也存在不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更可解释、稳健和泛化的LLM心理评估框架提出了未来方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered
tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their
social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews
have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not
been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse
psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications
of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically
review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1)
assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics
(consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation
methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both
the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit
reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant
variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological
challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs'
capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study
aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust,
and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个研究多个集体如何战略性地操纵数据驱动系统的框架，通过实验发现集体间的无意识互动会显著影响效果，强调了算法透明度和集体行动的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据依赖的算法系统在生活中的应用越来越广泛，个人和集体需要有能力维护自身利益并对算法问责，而多个集体同时行动时可能产生意想不到的互动。

Method: 研究者引入了一个框架，用于研究两个或更多集体如何战略性地影响数据驱动系统，并通过语言模型分类器和推荐系统进行实验，分析目标、策略、规模和同质性对集体效能的影响。

Result: 研究发现，集体间的无意识互动可能导致单个集体的效能下降高达75%，而推荐系统中完全异质或同质的集体都不是最有效的，异质性的影响远小于集体规模。

Conclusion: 研究强调了算法模型和行为透明的重要性，并为集体利用自身数据维护利益、问责系统开发者提供了框架。

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more
domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and
hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence,
individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that
engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size,
membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we
introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two
or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven
systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected
interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with
language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives
each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how
differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a
collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between
collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be
able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for
themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts
simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We
find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor
fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that
heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results
signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models
and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these
systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system
developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use
their own data to promote their own interests.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）的早期和准确诊断对改善患者预后至关重要。现有研究多局限于单一数据模态，未能充分挖掘多模态方法的潜力。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为研究人员提供全面的多模态PD识别系统综述。

Method: 通过分析347篇来自主要科学数据库的文章，综述了包括MRI、步态分析、手写分析、语音测试数据等多种数据模态的PD识别系统，重点关注数据收集方法、特征表示及系统性能。

Result: 研究总结了多模态方法在PD识别中的优势，包括更高的识别准确性和鲁棒性，为开发下一代PD诊断系统提供了指导。

Conclusion: 通过整合多模态数据和前沿机器学习技术，本综述为提升PD诊断水平提供了创新思路，有助于改善患者护理。

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily
affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed
globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan
Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is
crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition,
existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities
and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these
gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems
across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test
data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on
over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key
aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and
system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing
actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition
systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine
learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD
diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal
approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新颖的外周区域消除(OVR)方法，结合深度学习技术，用于提高实时动态MRI的图像质量，适用于无法忍受传统呼吸暂停的患者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时动态MRI在捕获快速生理过程中至关重要，尤其是心脏功能评估。然而，高加速率下的伪影问题限制了其应用，因此需要一种无需修改采集过程的有效解决方案。

Method: 研究采用基于深度学习的方法，通过估计和消除非心脏区域的伪影信号，结合物理驱动的深度学习重建方法，恢复高时空分辨率的图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在高加速率下获得的图像质量在视觉上与临床基线图像相当，同时在定性和定量上都优于传统重建技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为实时动态MRI中的伪影减少提供了实用且有效的解决方案，有望在不改变采集条件的情况下提高加速率并保持诊断质量。

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在处理高保真动力系统时，反复评估大量参数配置的解且无法访问控制方程时，需要高效的数据驱动降阶技术。

Method: 提出子空间距离驱动的主动学习框架（SDE-AL），利用POD表示解子空间，定义子空间距离度量并证明其为度量标准，扩展了两种现有非侵入式ROM方法。

Result: 在两种参数化物理模型中验证了SDE-AL框架的高效性。

Conclusion: SDE-AL方法能有效减少计算成本，提升ROM构建效率。

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to
be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in
absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model
reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning
approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by
greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter
domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of
high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The
high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific
linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and
the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to
perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance
measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with
different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The
usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)
framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive
reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven
(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.
Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,
highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM
emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time
intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence
(AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is
featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large
models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks.
However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over
wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial
communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of
edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of
edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management.
Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training
frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to
enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we
investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on
channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and
applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

### [157] [Transition States Energies from Machine Learning: An Application to Reverse Water-Gas Shift on Single-Atom Alloys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00574)
*Raffaele Cheula,Mie Andersen*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于高斯过程回归和Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman图核（WWL-GPR）的机器学习模型，用于预测过渡态（TS）能量，显著提高了逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS）在单原子合金（SAA）催化剂上的能量预测精度，并通过微动力学模型展示了预测误差的降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算过渡态能量和密度泛函理论方法成本高昂，难以用于复杂材料和反应网络的大规模筛选。需要一种高效且准确的预测方法。

Method: 使用基于Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman图核的高斯过程回归模型（WWL-GPR），并结合微动力学模型进行不确定性传播分析。

Result: WWL-GPR模型显著提高了预测精度，误差比传统标度关系或非图表示的ML模型降低近一个数量级，并成功筛选出RWGS反应的潜在催化剂。

Conclusion: 结合机器学习与第一性原理计算，为复杂反应催化剂设计提供了高效且可靠的框架。

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in
computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the
high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density
functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for
predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the
Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to
predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)
reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can
significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on
scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further
benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of
WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data
and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF)
predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models.
Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that
the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to
scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy
predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to
screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work
highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and
microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS,
providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

### [158] [Neuroevolution of Self-Attention Over Proto-Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00186)
*Rafael C. Pinto,Anderson R. Tavares*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于‘原型物体’的视觉注意力机制，替代传统的矩形图像块，通过图像分割处理高级特征，显著减少了表示复杂度和计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于矩形图像块的注意力机制在处理视觉强化学习任务时表现良好，但其计算复杂度和资源消耗较高。利用图像分割处理的‘原型物体’能更高效地编码语义信息。

Method: 采用图像分割技术提取‘原型物体’，将其编码为紧凑的特征向量，构建更小的自注意力模块，以减少参数和训练时间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法的性能与现有最佳矩形块方法相当或更优，同时参数减少了62%、训练时间缩短了2.6倍。

Conclusion: 基于‘原型物体’的注意力机制在减少计算资源的同时保持了高性能，为视觉强化学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a
promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on
rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work
demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a
controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual
reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work
with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed
patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image
decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object
can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a
substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic
information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach
matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based
implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

*Jacob Carlson,Melissa Dell*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 论文提出了MARS框架，用于从非结构化数据中进行高效且稳健的参数推断，解决了深度学习预测可能带来的偏差问题，并应用于描述性和因果性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络的普及，经济学家越来越多地从文本和图像等非结构化数据中提取信息，但这些预测可能存在偏差，影响估计结果。

Method: 通过将非结构化数据的推断问题重新定义为缺失结构化数据的填补问题，并结合半参数推断理论，提出了MARS框架。

Result: MARS提供了一种稳健且高效的估计方法，适用于现有文献中较少关注的常见经验场景，并通过重新分析已有研究验证了其实际价值。

Conclusion: MARS为基于非结构化数据的推断提供了一种通用解决方案，连接了传统问题和新兴的机器学习方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust
inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text,
images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from
texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with
advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not
generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to
estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe
inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where
structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural
networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from
semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators
based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At
Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends
existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions,
linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference.
We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal
estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and
transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to
common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing
literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data,
demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过预训练估计器简化结构模型的应用，使其对研究者和从业者更易用。

Method: 利用神经网络从数据模式中识别结构模型参数，并在一个难以估计的序列搜索模型上进行初步试验。

Result: 预训练估计器在14个真实数据集上验证，运行时间短且准确性高。

Conclusion: 预训练的现成估计器能提高结构模型的可及性和实用性。

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The
estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost
and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator.
Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little
computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net
to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial
trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model
that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator
on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high
accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,
pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible
to researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: 该研究首次通过人类感知实验分析了病理语音匿名化技术的效果，发现虽然匿名化能有效保护隐私（判别准确率高达91%-93%），但会显著降低语音质量（从83%降至59%），且不同病理类型的影响差异显著。结果呼吁开发兼顾隐私保护和临床实用性的定制化匿名策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理语音数据的匿名化对伦理共享至关重要，但现有技术对人类感知的影响缺乏研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过人类听众的反馈评估匿名化技术的实际效果。

Method: 研究采用结构化感知实验，邀请10名母语和非母语德语听众，对180名发音人（包括各类病理语音和健康对照）的匿名-原始语音对进行图灵测试和质量评分。语音通过先进匿名技术处理（错误率30-40%），实验设置零样本和少样本条件。

Result: 匿名化后语音判别准确率总体较高（零样本91%，少样本93%），但病理类型间差异显著（如构音障碍96% vs. 发声障碍86%）。匿名化显著降低感知质量（83%→59%），且母语与非母语听众对原始语音的评分差异在匿名后几乎消失。人类感知结果与自动化隐私/临床指标无相关性。

Conclusion: 研究强调需结合听众反馈，开发针对特定病理和场景的匿名化策略，在保护隐私的同时保持语音的可解读性、沟通功能和诊断价值，尤其对儿童等脆弱群体。

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of
pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain
understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered
analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual
protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse
linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated
anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and
Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.
Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error
rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination
and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot
(repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%
zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:
p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization
consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with
pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native
listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners
(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization
(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,
human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical
utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed,
disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy
while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic
utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces
major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task
planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in
response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task
requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper
proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV
swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs)
is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting
them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target
tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV
motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of
emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted
across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to
dynamic changes.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by
limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design
tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated
design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider
shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex
solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated
computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the
creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach
involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,
utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable
neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow
facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading
to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control
settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming
pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders
surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By
addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid
surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly
efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean
exploration and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis
framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the
framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient
considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a
hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of
ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives
vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic
ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety
measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the
framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order
Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted
high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent
maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against
traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on
highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for
active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception
in complex traffic environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control
of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists
of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions
of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these
predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an
energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step
predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized
to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of
treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by
proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The
overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a
specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach
allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its
performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical
warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

Conclusion: 该自适应控制器展现更强的鲁棒性和适应性，无需人工设计步态或手动调整。

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across
diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can
account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules
or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured
environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to
dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework
consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an
adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and
improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed
approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world
hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on
flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes.
Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the
controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating
enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or
manual tuning.

Motivation: 虽然现有的交互式机器人学习方法可以减少人类努力，但它们通常局限于单任务场景，不适合持续的多任务协作。

Method: COIL将问题建模为无容量限制设施选址（UFL）问题，并在已知用户偏好时使用近似算法进行多项式时间规划。面对偏好不确定性时，加入一步信念空间规划。

Result: 模拟和物理实验表明，COIL能显著减少人类工作量，同时保持任务完成成功率。

Conclusion: COIL在多任务协作中有效平衡了人类努力和任务完成，是交互式机器人学习的可行方案。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user
preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot
learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to
single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task
collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a
multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of
tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,
and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an
uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal
planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We
extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by
incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation
algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated
and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework
significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while
maintaining successful task completion.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆在动态环境中部署联邦学习模型时，常因时序灾难性遗忘导致历史知识丢失，FedEMA旨在通过双创新策略平衡模型的泛化与适应能力。

Method: FedEMA包含两项核心创新：(1)服务器端通过融合当前轮次聚合模型与历史EMA模型保留历史拟合能力；(2)车辆端采用负熵正则化防止模型对EMA引入的时序模式过拟合。

Result: 在Cityscapes和Camvid数据集上的实验表明，FedEMA比现有方法mIoU提高了7.12%，验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: FedEMA通过双目标优化有效解决了联邦学习中的时序遗忘问题，同时理论收敛性分析和实验验证了其高效性。

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex
task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically
face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models
through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models
face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically
evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of
historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average
(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral
innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation
via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL
round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative
entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to
EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a
dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and
adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the
proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid
dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing
7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating
autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,
existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient
consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion
model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial
safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a
graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that
captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational
efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the
denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and
adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that
drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally
realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module
based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical
plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness
and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a
high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic
safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation
of autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 可变形物体操控（如弹性带）因自由度无限和部分观测导致策略学习复杂，需高效的状态表示方法。

Conclusion: INR-DOM通过结合神经表示与强化学习，显著提升了弹性可变形物体操控的策略学习效率与性能。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly
elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation
(DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited
degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial
observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling
complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a
novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called
INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with
partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit
surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform
exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that
enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while
efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative
analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation
studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm. Videos are available at

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most
previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to
the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal
logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF,
Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We
identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K
specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in
five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D
space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped
navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL
satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach
is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we
show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and
robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at

often arise in planning problems where the agent is uncertain about its
environmental state but can act and observe deterministically. In this paper,
we propose DetMCVI, an adaptation of the Monte Carlo Value Iteration (MCVI)
algorithm for DetPOMDPs, which builds policies in the form of finite-state
controllers (FSCs). DetMCVI solves large problems with a high success rate,
outperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance
of the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,
verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research
domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon
this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our
application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively
transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution
monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding
drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose
a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network
controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show
that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition
benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying
such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose
a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate
formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results
suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and
robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited
in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle
and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,
which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will
enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's
lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.

Conclusion: RoVI与VIEW流程结合有效提升了机器人在空间任务中的表现，为未来人机交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot
interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic
control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel
paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic
representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into
human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,
circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable
robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we
present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for
RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from
2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable
3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K
instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to
effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated
across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating
significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success
rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step
actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and
Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

Motivation: 当前深度学习方法（如GNNs）在材料科学中虽然预测能力强，但缺乏物理可解释性。论文旨在解决这一问题，通过结合GNNs和符号回归，实现预测与解释的双重目标。

Method: 采用自适应的图注意力网络（SA-GAT）筛选关键特征，并结合符号回归（SR）模块生成紧凑的解析表达式，揭示量子力学意义的关系。计算复杂度保持O(n)。

Result: 该方法比传统符号回归实现快23倍，能够高效地从180维特征空间中提取关键特征，并生成物理可解释的解析表达式。

Conclusion: SA-GAT-SR框架成功弥补了预测准确性与物理可解释性之间的鸿沟，为计算材料科学提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of
deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for
high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling
enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While
the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and
universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack
physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we
introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention
Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically
combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of
symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm
that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen
critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while
maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently
distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly
reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times
acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on
first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a
new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between
predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical
insights into material behavior.

TL;DR: 本文通过量化(如float8)和降维(如PCA)技术优化高维向量嵌入的存储，实现高效检索增强生成。float8量化在4倍压缩下性能损失<0.3%，优于int8；结合PCA可达成8倍压缩且性能更优。

Motivation: 高维向量嵌入(float32)的存储需求在大规模应用中面临内存挑战，研究旨在通过量化与降维技术平衡存储效率与模型性能。

Method: 系统评估量化(float16/int8/binary/float8)和降维方法(PCA/Kernel PCA/UMAP等)，提出基于性能-存储权衡空间的可视化配置选择方法。

Result: float8量化+50% PCA维度保留可实现8倍压缩，性能损失低于单独使用int8(仅4倍压缩)。PCA是最高效的降维技术。

Conclusion: float8量化与适度PCA结合是最佳实践，提出的可视化权衡方法可帮助用户根据内存限制选择最优配置。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving
relevant information from external knowledge bases, relying on high-dimensional
vector embeddings typically stored in float32 precision. However, storing these
embeddings at scale presents significant memory challenges. To address this
issue, we systematically investigate on MTEB benchmark two complementary
optimization strategies: quantization, evaluating standard formats (float16,
int8, binary) and low-bit floating-point types (float8), and dimensionality
reduction, assessing methods like PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, Random Projections and
Autoencoders. Our results show that float8 quantization achieves a 4x storage
reduction with minimal performance degradation (<0.3%), significantly
outperforming int8 quantization at the same compression level, being simpler to
implement. PCA emerges as the most effective dimensionality reduction
technique. Crucially, combining moderate PCA (e.g., retaining 50% dimensions)
with float8 quantization offers an excellent trade-off, achieving 8x total
compression with less performance impact than using int8 alone (which provides
only 4x compression). To facilitate practical application, we propose a
methodology based on visualizing the performance-storage trade-off space to
identify the optimal configuration that maximizes performance within their
specific memory constraints.

Motivation: 当前RAG基准测试主要依赖公共数据，缺乏对私有和个人化上下文的支持，限制了RAG在私有数据上的应用。

Conclusion: EnronQA填补了私有数据RAG评估的空白，为个性化检索和私有文档处理提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular
methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM)
because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the
cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of
private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many
enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's
understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for
private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for
validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data
such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.
Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA
benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs
across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG
pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction
of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA
to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over
private documents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document
re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,
largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we
investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs
pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,
such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring
additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and
domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation
in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available
scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves
state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in
P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into
the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for

TL;DR: 论文提出了ChebyCF，一种基于图谱过滤的协同过滤框架，解决了传统图卷积网络在嵌入层和邻域聚合上的局限性，通过利用完整的信号频谱和Chebyshev插值实现了更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图卷积网络在协同过滤中存在两个主要瓶颈：嵌入层导致潜在空间容量有限，忽略了局部偏好模式；邻域聚合方法无法细粒度地利用多样化的偏好模式。这些限制了推荐系统的性能。

Method: ChebyCF采用图谱过滤方法，直接利用用户的原始交互历史（而非嵌入层），并通过Chebyshev插值近似非线性图滤波器，同时结合理想通滤波器和基于度数的归一化增强性能。

Result: 实验表明，ChebyCF克服了传统方法的局限性，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并保持较快的推理速度。

Conclusion: ChebyCF通过图谱过滤和非线性滤波器的结合，显著提升了推荐系统的性能，为协同过滤提供了更高效和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative
filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks
in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent
space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially
valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is
limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a
fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these
limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum
and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a
CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,
it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of
signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively
approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by
using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through
extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned
bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.

Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics
data is critical for advancing both diagnostic and pathogenesis research. In
this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector
Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19.
Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked
by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and
bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both
classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative
control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum
kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and
the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM
consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or
exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge
regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation,
our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for
multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for
fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena
such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature
representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear
patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data
preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a
credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models.
Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of
45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures
reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes
per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a
unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the
quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a
conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid
quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of

*Kuan-Cheng Chen,Hiromichi Matsuyama,Wei-Hao Huang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合量子神经网络的量子元学习框架（QAOA+QLSTM），通过在小规模图上训练QLSTM优化器，显著减少了大图优化的迭代次数，并在Max-Cut和Sherrington-Kirkpatrick模型中验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于QAOA在参数优化时面临复杂的能量地形和硬件噪声问题，传统方法难以高效扩展。为了提升量子优化的性能和可扩展性，需要一种更有效的优化策略。

Method: 作者提出了一种量子元学习框架，将量子长短期记忆网络（QLSTM）与QAOA结合。通过在小规模图上训练QLSTM优化器，使其能快速适应更大、更复杂的优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，基于QLSTM的优化器在Max-Cut和Sherrington-Kirkpatrick模型中比经典基线收敛更快，且获得更高的近似比。

Conclusion: 该研究为NISQ时代的可扩展量子优化提供了一条可行路径，证明了量子元学习在优化问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) promise efficient
solutions to classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems by
harnessing shallow-depth quantum circuits. Yet, their performance and
scalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains
nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we
introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural
networks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures,
with QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our
approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially
reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through
comprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
instances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and
achieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby
offering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

### [185] [Detecting and Mitigating Hateful Content in Multimodal Memes with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00150)
*Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的方法，用于检测和消除多模态仇恨表情包中的仇恨内容，定义引导的提示技术和UnHateMeme框架取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上多模态表情包常被滥用传播仇恨言论，现有研究虽能检测仇恨内容，但如何有效转化仇恨内容仍具挑战。论文旨在利用VLM的强大能力解决这一问题。

Method: 采用定义引导的提示技术检测仇恨表情包，并开发UnHateMeme框架替换仇恨文本或视觉内容，同时保持图像与文本的多模态一致性。测试了LLaVA、Gemini和GPT-4o等先进VLM。

Result: VLM在仇恨表情包检测任务中表现优异，UnHateMeme框架能有效将仇恨表情包转化为非仇恨形式，且符合人类对仇恨言论的标准及多模态一致性要求。

Conclusion: 论文展示了VLM在确保网络安全和尊重环境中的重要应用潜力，为仇恨内容转化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication
channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express
their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or
humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to
disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of
hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform
hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the
powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This
paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting
technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for
mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing
hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,
VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.
Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a
strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet
human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between
image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the
proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective
strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on
important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online
environments.

TL;DR: AVA是一个基于VLM的视频分析系统，通过构建事件知识图谱（EKG）和代理检索生成机制，实现了对超长视频的高效分析和开放查询处理，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分析系统通常仅限于预定义任务，难以适应开放场景。尽管视频语言模型（VLMs）展现出潜力，但其上下文窗口限制阻碍了对超长视频的处理。

Method: AVA结合了实时构建的事件知识图谱（EKG）和代理检索生成机制，以高效索引和处理复杂查询。

Result: AVA在LVBench和VideoMME-Long上分别达到62.3%和64.1%的准确率，显著优于现有方法；在AVA-100基准测试中，准确率为75.8%。

Conclusion: AVA通过创新的EKG和检索生成机制，成功解决了超长视频分析的挑战，为开放场景视频分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse
domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,
predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical
scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as
transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling
open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their
limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video
content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we
introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video
analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time
construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or
continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism
that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that
AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,
respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video
analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new
benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours
in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex
question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an
accuracy of 75.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Pack-PTQ的新型后训练量化方法，通过设计Hessian引导的自适应打包机制和混合精度量化，解决了现有方法忽略跨块依赖性和低比特情况下精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练量化方法通常采用块级重建，忽略了跨块依赖性，尤其在低比特情况下精度下降显著。本文旨在通过改进量化单元和分配策略，提升量化模型的精度。

Method: 1. 设计Hessian引导的自适应打包机制，将块划分为非重叠的包作为重建基础单元，保留跨块依赖性；2. 提出混合精度量化，根据包的灵敏度分配不同比特宽度。

Result: 在2D图像和3D点云分类任务中，实验表明Pack-PTQ在多种网络架构下均优于现有的后训练量化方法。

Conclusion: Pack-PTQ通过优化量化单元和比特分配策略，显著提升了低比特量化模型的精度，为复杂模型的高效压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for
compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and
avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ
block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a
notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a
Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into
non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby
preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization
parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a
mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs
according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing
performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud
classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过多时序影像和NDVI堆叠方法提升田块边界划分的准确性，并验证模型在不同地理区域的迁移学习能力。

Method: 采用UNET架构的四种深度学习模型，结合多时序影像和NDVI堆叠方法，在荷兰和巴基斯坦区域进行训练和迁移学习。

Result: 多时序NDVI堆叠提供了额外的时间上下文信息，显著提升了边界划分效果；空间分辨率对小型农田尤为重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多尺度地面信息和高空间分辨率对田块边界建模的重要性，成果可推广至异构农业环境。

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for
better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic
segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming
systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and
October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of
Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of
Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP)
vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field
boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with
UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date
images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of
IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack
approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using
pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan.
Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary
data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the
Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide
additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the
season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground
information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and
universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also
highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field
boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to
multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation
in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FGSTP的算法，用于高效准确地检测和分割气体泄漏，解决了隐蔽性和随机形状带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气体泄漏对人类健康和环境构成重大风险，但由于其隐蔽外观和随机形状，现有方法难以有效检测和分割。

Method: 提出FGSTP算法，通过构建相关体积捕获帧间运动信息，逐步细化对象级特征，并使用解码器优化边界分割。

Result: 在手动标注的GasVid数据集上，FGSTP模型在非刚性物体（如气体泄漏）分割方面优于其他SOTA模型。

Conclusion: FGSTP算法在气体泄漏分割任务中表现出色，为实际应用提供了高精度解决方案。

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite
long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and
accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and
random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal
Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical
motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in
an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to
capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained
perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous
outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.
Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,
we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on
GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such
as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Conclusion: 该模型通过不确定性量化提升放疗工作流程的安全性和可靠性，同时优化了临床决策效率。

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment
(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in
radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging
Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,
the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth
contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to
classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A
calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical
accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual
labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate
cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,
transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were
available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all
scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34
subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated
threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted
in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting
cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring
efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed
clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more
reliable radiotherapy workflows.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为NVTM的新框架，通过分解时空3D视频数据为带有流信息的2D网格，实现快速学习视频表示并高效利用参数，显著提升了编码速度和参数效率，同时在多个视频任务中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于网格参数化编码的隐式神经表示（INR）方法虽然在视频应用中实现了快速编码，但由于未考虑视频的动态特性，导致参数冗余和比特率较高。为此，作者提出了NVTM框架，旨在通过引入时间相干调制来捕捉视频的动态特征，提升编码速度和参数效率。

Method: NVTM将时空3D视频数据分解为一组带有流信息的2D网格，通过时间相干调制实现快速学习和高效参数利用。该方法能够一次性处理时间对应的像素，显著提升编码速度。

Result: 实验表明，NVTM在UVG（动态）和MCL-JCV（动态）数据集上的PSNR/LPIPS指标分别平均提升1.54dB/0.019和1.84dB/0.013，且在编码速度上比NeRV风格方法快3倍以上。此外，在超分辨率、帧插值和视频修复等任务中均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: NVTM通过结合时间相干调制，显著提升了视频表示的编码速度和参数效率，同时在多项任务中表现优于现有方法，为视频处理和压缩提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications
across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up
training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art
approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a
faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid
usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant
use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter
efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a
parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video
representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework
that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the
spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,
NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter
efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels
at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video
quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed
increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019
improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)
and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),
compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,
we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,
HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform
extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm
across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and
video inpainting. Project page is https://sujiikim.github.io/NVTM/.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于点轨迹自动编码的新型视频生成评估指标，旨在更好地衡量视频中物体的交互和运动质量，解决了现有方法（如FVD）在评估生成视频运动效果上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型的局限性在于生成的帧看起来合理，但运动效果较差。现有的评估方法（如FVD）未能很好地捕捉这一问题，因此需要一种更有效的指标来评估运动的真实性和对象交互的合理性。

Method: 作者提出了一种基于自动编码点轨迹的方法，通过提取运动特征来比较视频的分布或评估单个视频的运动质量。这一方法相比基于像素重建或动作识别特征更为敏感，能够更准确地检测合成数据中的时间失真。

Result: 实验表明，新指标对合成数据中的时间畸变更敏感，并且在预测人类对生成视频时间一致性和真实感的评估方面优于多种现有方法。此外，通过点轨迹表示，还能定位生成视频中的不一致性，提高了错误解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新指标显著提升了对生成视频运动质量的评估能力，并为未来生成视频模型的改进提供了更清晰的诊断工具。

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate
plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured
by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go
beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object
interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point
tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare
distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as
many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show
that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition
features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal
distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal
consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models
better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point
track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video
inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors
relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

Motivation: 联合建模RGB和深度分布，以生成高质量图像和几何准确的深度图，同时探索联合分布建模是否可作为条件生成的替代方案。

Method: 使用自适应调度权重（根据模态噪声水平调整）和不平衡时间步采样策略，训练模型覆盖所有噪声水平。

Conclusion: 联合分布建模是一种有效的条件生成替代方案，JointDiT展示了其在多模态生成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint
distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional
generation. The project page is available at

Motivation: 针对现有超分辨率方法在感知质量与结构保真度之间难以平衡的问题，尤其是高倍率放大时的挑战，提出改进方案。

Method: 集成四元数小波预处理和潜在扩散模型，设计了新的四元数小波及时间感知编码器，动态嵌入小波信息至去噪过程，并利用Stable Diffusion的生成先验。

Result: 在特定领域数据集上表现优异，感知质量和标准指标均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: ResQu框架通过创新性地结合小波变换与扩散模型，显著提升了超分辨率任务的效果。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad
applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for
enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While
deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality
reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains
challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches
leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often
struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,
we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet
preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new
quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply
apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the
conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are
dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also
leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.
Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing
approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will
be available after the revision process.

Motivation: 解决多模态医学影像中因模态缺失导致的模型训练资源密集和不切实际的问题。

Method: 采用掩码图像建模预训练策略，使同一预训练模型能适应任何可用模态组合。

Result: 在多种下游任务中表现优于或与需单独预训练的基线模型相当，并能高效重构缺失模态。

Conclusion: BM-MAE提供了一种高效、灵活的多模态MRI预训练方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测和跟踪方法对传感器故障的鲁棒性不足，本研究旨在通过合成数据增强改善这一问题。

Method: 提出了一个模拟摄像头-雷达数据退化的合成数据增强流程，并训练了一个轻量级噪声识别神经网络。

Abstract: Detecting and tracking objects is a crucial component of any autonomous
navigation method. For the past decades, object detection has yielded promising
results using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on
performance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these
detection and tracking pipelines, notably to sensor failures. In this paper we
attempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data
augmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our
goal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to
real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight
Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset,
reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across
10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.

*Simon Giebenhain,Tobias Kirschstein,Martin Rünz,Lourdes Agapito,Matthias Nießner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixel3DMM利用深度学习和3DMM结合，通过单张RGB图像进行高质量3D人脸重建，几何精度提升15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单图像3D人脸重建的挑战，尤其是复杂表情和多样性的需求。

Method: 结合DINO预训练模型的特化UV坐标和法线预测头，训练高泛化性ViT模型，并优化FLAME 3DMM参数拟合。

Result: 在包含丰富表情和多样性的新基准测试中，几何精度超过基线15%。

Conclusion: Pixel3DMM在单图像3D人脸重建中表现优异，尤其擅长复杂表情的几何恢复。

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To
this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers
which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization
of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO
foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate
prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face
datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over
1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a
FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the
uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new
benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity
facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark
is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,
our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of
geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

*Shuo Tong,Shangde Gao,Ke Liu,Zihang Huang,Hongxia Xu,Haochao Ying,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为UMKD的新框架，通过不确定性感知的多专家知识蒸馏解决疾病图像评分中的领域偏移和数据不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病图像评分的自动化为医疗保健提供了更快更准确的评估，但数据不平衡导致的领域偏移使模型出现偏差，影响临床部署。

Method: UMKD结合不确定性感知的解耦蒸馏机制，动态调整知识转移权重，同时处理任务无关和任务特定特征，并解决模型架构异质性和领域差异问题。

Result: 在前列腺组织学评分和眼底图像评分数据集上，UMKD在源不平衡和目标不平衡场景中均取得了最优表现。

Conclusion: UMKD为真实世界的疾病图像评分提供了一种鲁棒且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial
intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient
assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance,
introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical
applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple
expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract
discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific
features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At
the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism
dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model
uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD
also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution
discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled
by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading
(\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that
UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and
target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for
real-world disease image grading.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用单目2D视频构建3D食物模型，准确监测饮食行为，避免传统自报告方法的不准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统饮食监测依赖自报告数据，准确性低，无法实时反映饮食行为，可能导致健康风险。

Method: 采用COLMAP和姿态估计算法从2D视频生成3D食物模型，并通过体积变化监测摄入行为。

Result: 实验证明，该方法在玩具模型和真实食物上均能有效捕捉饮食行为变化。

Conclusion: 3D重建方法为自动化、精准的饮食监测工具开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated
with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on
self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.
This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by
leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and
pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,
allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments
with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.
Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition
challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The
3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary
behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and
accurate dietary monitoring tools.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个基于深度强化学习的框架，用于优化德里的空气净化亭布局，以提升空气质量指数，并通过实验验证其效果优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德里的空气污染问题严重，传统的空气净化设备布局方法效果有限，无法适应动态城市环境的需求。

Method: 研究使用了近端策略优化（PPO）算法，结合人口密度、交通模式等多项因素，优化空气净化亭的布局。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于强化学习的方法在AQI改善、空间覆盖等方面优于随机和贪婪策略。

Conclusion: AI驱动的空间优化方法在智慧城市和空气质量管理的应用中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于网页GUI图像的视觉复杂性和大量界面元素，准确选择动作具有挑战性，因此提出了RegionFocus以改善这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种动态缩放相关区域的方法，并通过图像-地图机制可视化关键地标，增强了动作选择的透明度和准确性。

Result: 在两个基准测试（Screenspot-pro和WebVoyager）上，性能提升了28%和24%，并在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到了61.6%的最新接地性能。

Conclusion: RegionFocus通过视觉测试时间缩放显著提升了视觉语言模型代理的交互性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision
Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual
complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making
accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on
relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.
To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes
key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables
the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple
region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on
Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two
state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,
highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive
settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on
the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.
Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: 该研究为小型卫星任务提供了高效的ML解决方案，并推动了太空技术与人工智能在非洲的发展。

Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of
geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs
allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can
benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better
performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature
extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on
the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data
compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source
anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is
demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets
of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches
in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology
and artificial intelligence in Africa.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于A3C强化学习算法的自适应资源调度方法，旨在解决微服务系统中资源动态性和任务并发性的挑战，并在实验中验证了其高效性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微服务系统面临高资源动态性和密集任务并发性的问题，传统方法难以有效应对，因此需要一种更智能的调度策略。

Method: 将调度问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，结合A3C算法，通过异步多线程学习机制优化策略和价值网络，实现细粒度资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在任务延迟、调度成功率、资源利用率和收敛速度等指标上优于典型方案，显著提升了高负载下的系统稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统资源分配瓶颈，为微服务系统的智能调度提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task
concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource
scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The
scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and
value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation
under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous
multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel
sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design
improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the
experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling
scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches
across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success
rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the
proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in
multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource
allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load,
demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice
systems.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于迁移学习的新型课程学习框架，用于神经网路量子态（NQS），显著提高计算效率并优化稳定性，特别适用于强关联电子系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网路量子态（NQS）在复杂量子多体系统中表现出高精度预测能力，但计算成本高昂，难以高效探索多样化的参数范围。迁移学习的提出虽能缓解这一问题，但在大规模系统和多样化参数区间中的泛化能力仍不足。

Method: 论文提出一种基于迁移学习的课程学习框架，通过动态调整学习任务的难度顺序，优化NQS的训练过程。同时提出Pairing-Net架构，专为强关联电子系统设计，并采用微扰理论视角解释迁移学习过程，以融入先验物理知识。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法实现了约200倍的计算加速，并且相比传统方法显著提高了优化的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过课程学习和迁移学习的结合，为NQS在量子多体系统中的高效探索提供了可行方案，Pairing-Net架构的实际验证进一步展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled
high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as
strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains
prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction
strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning
has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to
large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on
transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration
across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by
interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate
how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum
learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically
implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and
empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately
200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization
stability compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also
a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This
context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and
intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the
Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this
implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A
with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system
analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and
allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured
knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We
evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular
Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed
recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas
where AI support can improve visualization design.

Result: 在功率约束下实现满意的分类精度，多跳条件下在中等信噪比下精度进一步提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为多跳MIMO网络中的机器学习提供了高效解决方案，性能随跳数增加而提升。

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input
and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate
fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by
carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural
network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with
the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the
corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train
PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification
error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints,
with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then
obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block
extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that
the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory
classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that
higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of
hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step
responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but
remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and
formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM
multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When
dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive
error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated
failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The
best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents
but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below
random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to
achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and
the need for further research in this area. Code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和能源消耗上优于传统MARL，且能实现智能体行为的动态优化，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging
systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is
periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a
domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,
this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands
compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By
developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated
into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and
autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach
that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This
led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit
encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which
agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment
without the need for explicit communication between agents.

Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in
bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical
statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While
Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex
biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for
validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in
Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations
learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI
techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the
internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance
functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)
discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the
network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how
confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for
comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,
machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their
respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.
