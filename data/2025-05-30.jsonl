So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from\nexperiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which\ntakes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is\npragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally\nfulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,\ntranscends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or\nchains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about\nthe value of intuition and reflection."}

In artificial neural networks, this\nis typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by\ninjecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters\nthemselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as\nserotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn\nweights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.\nRather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we\noptimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To\naccomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as\nthe minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric\nmovement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects\na single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for\na particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.\nFirst, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a\nconvenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.\nSecond, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging\ngeneralization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several\ntopologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.\nnoise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their\nsimplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks\nby input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.\nThese results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds\noffers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning."}

Instead of migrating entire ML jobs, LUMION dynamically\nintegrates spare accelerators into ongoing workloads as failures occur, thereby\nmaintaining consistent performance without costly migrations.

Querying\napproaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,\nand without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face\nsignificant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.\nConstructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these\ndimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a\nmulti-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the\nmulti-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space\nensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces\nsearch space through a class-based query mechanism."}

Therefore, this paper aims to\nexplore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with\nimperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three\nrepresentative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate\ncontrol (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how\ninput characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between\nthem make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural\nnetwork-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under\nlimited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the\nthree interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse\nenvironment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating\nimperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL\nagent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping\nand control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,\nachieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively.

Front-end\nwarehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of\nfresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of\ndeciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account\ncapacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize\n(PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align\nprediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer\nsatisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task\nOptimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes\nproduct selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer\nsatisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs\na 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal\ninventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking\nmodel PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a\npost-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh\nplatform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO\nmethod. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances\nthe full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and\nnarrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These\nfindings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at\nfront-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable\ninsights for future research in this domain."}

Despite\ntheir recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that\nrequires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We\nobserve that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their\ndesign: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of\nmemory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,\noptimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less\nexpressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three\naspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that\nlearns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current\nand past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.\nBuilding on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like\narchitectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the\noriginal Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language\nmodeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context\nunderstanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers\nand recent linear recurrent models.

This\nwork introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a\ncontent-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by\nutilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate\nmodifications rather than mere copying.

In particular, this implies for certain choices of $G$ that this\nestimator is weakly consistent (as $T \\rightarrow \\infty$) under potentially\nvery stringent sampling, where only one coordinate is measured per vertex for a\nvanishingly small fraction of the vertices. The results are extended to a\n``multi-layer'' ranking problem where $x_t$ corresponds to the latent strengths\nof a collection of $n$ items, and noisy pairwise difference measurements are\nobtained at each ``layer'' $t$ via a measurement graph $G_t$. Weak consistency\nis established for certain choices of $G$ even when the individual $G_t$'s are\nvery sparse and disconnected."}

While they excel in zero-shot and\ntransfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification,\noften yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a\nsignificant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can\nlead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a\ntraining-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of\nestimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed\nmodality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly\nrepresented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring\nfunction that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We\nrigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4\narchitectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with\nimprovements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95\ncompared to existing baselines. By improving the reliability of the model\nwithout requiring retraining, TrustVLM paves the way for safer deployment of\nVLMs in real-world applications.

However, improving their\nspatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k\ndataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nspatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of\nvisual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

In this\npaper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve\nrebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of\ndiverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic\nsubstitutions to spatially-dependent cues (\"head\" over \"heels\").
