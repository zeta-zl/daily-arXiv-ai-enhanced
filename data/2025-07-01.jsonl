For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation\nof current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which\nmay be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and\nillustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets."}

Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,\nthe latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted\nand effective solution.

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies.

In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning.

This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\\varepsilon=32$ for\nlinear probing.

In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation.

LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it\ncaptures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving\nreliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual\nalignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output\ncalibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance\non labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings\nand reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.\nFurther analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model\ncapabilities critical to ICL success."}

The proposed method achieved an\naverage bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in\nMSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,\nbenchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that\nfeature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and\ndemonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias\nattribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the\ncomputational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning\nalgorithms. Future work could explore applying feature-wise mixing for\nreal-world fields where accurate predictions are necessary."}

Nevertheless, the existing\nbenchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision\nalgorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we\nhave devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory.

In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess.

Specifically, WATS harnesses the\nscalability and topology sensitivity of graph wavelets to refine confidence\nestimates, all without necessitating model retraining or access to neighboring\nlogits or predictions. Extensive evaluations across seven benchmark datasets\nwith varying graph structures and two GNN backbones demonstrate that WATS\nachieves the lowest Expected Calibration Error (ECE) among all compared\nmethods, outperforming both classical and graph-specific baselines by up to\n42.3\\% in ECE and reducing calibration variance by 17.24\\% on average compared\nwith graph-specific methods. Moreover, WATS remains computationally efficient,\nscaling well across graphs of diverse sizes and densities. Code will be\nreleased based on publication."}

In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation.

These methods are very difficult to\ndefend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or\ndecode ciphered content.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems.

However, previous work has shown that\nusers' perceptions of relevance can be changed by varying presentations, i.e.,\nallocating more vertical space to some documents to provide additional textual\nor image information. Furthermore, presentation length can also redirect\nattention, as users are more likely to notice longer presentations when\nscrolling through results. Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that\neven simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance\nimprovements over fixed-length models.

To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better.

We introduce Interactive Reasoning, an interaction\ndesign that visualizes chain-of-thought outputs as a hierarchy of topics and\nenables user review and modification. We implement interactive reasoning in\nHippo, a prototype for AI-assisted decision making in the face of uncertain\ntrade-offs. In a user study with 16 participants, we find that interactive\nreasoning in Hippo allows users to quickly identify and interrupt erroneous\ngenerations, efficiently steer the model towards customized responses, and\nbetter understand both model reasoning and model outputs.

Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the\npotential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens\noffers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful\nproperties in the sequence tokens.

To address\nthese gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for\nclose-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering. AutoEvoEval\nintroduces 22 interpretable atomic evolution operations and supports\nmulti-round compositions, enabling controlled generation of diverse,\nchallenging, and realistic test samples. We conduct extensive experiments\naddressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source\nLLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of\n7.283\\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the\nlargest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same\nperturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial\neffects by up to 52.932\\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may\noverestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for\nevolution-aware robustness evaluation.

However, these benefits remain out of\nreach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches\nyield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules.\n  This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and\nintroduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from\nraw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely\nchallenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and\npassive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos\naddresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint\nspecificity and succinctness.

Prior works related\nto cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without\nloss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these\ngaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend\nthe latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy\ngenerated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes\nthe real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept\nwith the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment\nresults show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in\nblending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of\nimage generative models to augment human creativity."}

However, the disparity between\nsynthetic and real data results in a domain gap. That gap leads to poor\nperformance and generalization of the trained ANN when applied to real-world\nscenarios. Several strategies have been developed to bridge this gap, which\ncombine synthetic and real data, known as mixed training using hybrid datasets.\nWhile these strategies have been shown to mitigate the domain gap, a systematic\nevaluation of their generalizability and robustness across various tasks and\narchitectures remains underexplored. To address this challenge, our study\ncomprehensively analyzes two widely used mixing strategies on three prevalent\narchitectures and three distinct hybrid datasets. From these datasets, we\nsample subsets with varying proportions of synthetic to real data to\ninvestigate the impact of synthetic and real components. The findings of this\npaper provide valuable insights into optimizing the use of synthetic data in\nthe training process of any ANN, contributing to enhancing robustness and\nefficacy."}

Concretely, we\nfind that representation dispersion - the average pairwise cosine distance\namong hidden vectors - strongly and negatively correlates with perplexity\nacross diverse model families (LLaMA, Qwen, and others) and domains (Wikipedia,\nnews, scientific abstracts). Beyond illustrating this link, we show how\ndispersion can be leveraged for a range of practical tasks without requiring\nlabeled data. First, measuring dispersion on unlabeled text allows us to\npredict downstream accuracy in new domains, offering a data-efficient tool for\nmodel selection. Next, we find that identifying layers with higher dispersion\npinpoints the best representations for retrieval-based methods such as kNN-LM,\nbypassing exhaustive layer-by-layer searches. Finally, we integrate a simple\npush-away objective into training, which increases dispersion in both\nsingle-domain and cross-domain scenarios and directly improves perplexity in\neach."}

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a\nwidely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale,\nwhich balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the\nguidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually\nappealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing\nguidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based\non the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method\naddresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that\nour guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with\nthe text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation.\nNotably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory\nconsumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance,\noffering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality."}

Properties\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\ndatasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by\nmaximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves\ncomparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.
