### [1] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Disease Labeling in CT Radiology Reports Across Organ Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03259)
*Michael E. Garcia-Alcoser,Mobina GhojoghNejad,Fakrul Islam Tushar,David Kim,Kyle J. Lafata,Geoffrey D. Rubin,Joseph Y. Lo*

Key words: 大型语言模型,CT报告,疾病标注,轻量级模型

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在自动化CT报告疾病标注中的有效性，比较了规则算法与轻量级开源模型的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 自动化标注CT报告可提高效率，但需验证方法的效果。

Method: 回顾性研究，测试规则算法和LLMs在多个数据集上的表现。

Result: 轻量级LLMs表现优于规则算法，尤其是Gemma-3和Llama-3.1。

Conclusion: LLMs提供高效灵活的标注方案，但存在标签局限性。

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of large language
models (LLMs) in automating disease annotation of CT radiology reports. We
compare a rule-based algorithm (RBA), RadBERT, and three lightweight
open-weight LLMs for multi-disease labeling of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP)
CT reports.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 40,833 CT reports
from 29,540 patients, with 1,789 CAP reports manually annotated across three
organ systems. External validation was conducted using the CT-RATE dataset.
Three open-weight LLMs were tested with zero-shot prompting. Performance was
evaluated using Cohen's Kappa and micro/macro-averaged F1 scores.
  Results: In 12,197 Duke CAP reports from 8,854 patients, Llama-3.1 8B and
Gemma-3 27B showed the highest agreement ($\kappa$ median: 0.87). On the
manually annotated set, Gemma-3 27B achieved the top macro-F1 (0.82), followed
by Llama-3.1 8B (0.79), while the RBA scored lowest (0.64). On the CT-RATE
dataset (lungs/pleura only), Llama-3.1 8B performed best (0.91), with Gemma-3
27B close behind (0.89). Performance differences were mainly due to differing
labeling practices, especially for lung atelectasis.
  Conclusion: Lightweight LLMs outperform rule-based methods for CT report
annotation and generalize across organ systems with zero-shot prompting.
However, binary labels alone cannot capture the full nuance of report language.
LLMs can provide a flexible, efficient solution aligned with clinical judgment
and user needs.

### [3] [FailureSensorIQ: A Multi-Choice QA Dataset for Understanding Sensor Relationships and Failure Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03278)
*Christodoulos Constantinides,Dhaval Patel,Shuxin Lin,Claudio Guerrero,Sunil Dagajirao Patil,Jayant Kalagnanam*

Key words: 多选题-问答基准, 工业4.0, 大语言模型, 故障预测, 特征选择

TL;DR: FailureSensorIQ是一个新颖的多选题-问答（MCQA）基准系统，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）在工业4.0领域中对复杂场景的推理和理解能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统QA基准无法充分评估LLM在工业领域中结合故障模式、传感器数据及其关系的推理能力。该系统旨在推动建模决策从数据驱动向领域驱动转变。

Method: 通过Perturbation-Uncertainty-Complexity分析、专家评估、资产特定知识差距分析及使用外部知识库的ReAct代理，评估了多种LLM的工业知识。

Result: 虽然闭源模型表现接近专家水平，但基准测试显示其性能易受扰动、干扰和知识差距的影响。成果还包括MCQA数据集、基准平台和基于LLM的特征选择工具。

Conclusion: FailureSensorIQ揭示了LLM在工业应用中的局限性，同时提供了实用工具和数据集以推动领域驱动的建模决策。

Abstract: We introduce FailureSensorIQ, a novel Multi-Choice Question-Answering (MCQA)
benchmarking system designed to assess the ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to reason and understand complex, domain-specific scenarios in Industry
4.0. Unlike traditional QA benchmarks, our system focuses on multiple aspects
of reasoning through failure modes, sensor data, and the relationships between
them across various industrial assets. Through this work, we envision a
paradigm shift where modeling decisions are not only data-driven using
statistical tools like correlation analysis and significance tests, but also
domain-driven by specialized LLMs which can reason about the key contributors
and useful patterns that can be captured with feature engineering. We evaluate
the Industrial knowledge of over a dozen LLMs-including GPT-4, Llama, and
Mistral-on FailureSensorIQ from different lens using
Perturbation-Uncertainty-Complexity analysis, Expert Evaluation study,
Asset-Specific Knowledge Gap analysis, ReAct agent using external
knowledge-bases. Even though closed-source models with strong reasoning
capabilities approach expert-level performance, the comprehensive benchmark
reveals a significant drop in performance that is fragile to perturbations,
distractions, and inherent knowledge gaps in the models. We also provide a
real-world case study of how LLMs can drive the modeling decisions on 3
different failure prediction datasets related to various assets. We release:
(a) expert-curated MCQA for various industrial assets, (b) FailureSensorIQ
benchmark and Hugging Face leaderboard based on MCQA built from non-textual
data found in ISO documents, and (c) LLMFeatureSelector, an LLM-based feature
selection scikit-learn pipeline. The software is available at
https://github.com/IBM/FailureSensorIQ.

### [4] [HyperSteer: Activation Steering at Scale with Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03292)
*Jiuding Sun,Sidharth Baskaran,Zhengxuan Wu,Michael Sklar,Christopher Potts,Atticus Geiger*

Key words: 语言模型、导向向量、超网络、自然语言提示、激活导向

TL;DR: HyperSteer是一种基于超网络架构的方法，通过自然语言提示生成导向向量，性能优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 目前的无监督字典学习方法虽然可扩展，但缺乏对每个导向向量效果的保证；监督方法虽有效，但需要额外的数据收集和训练。HyperSteer旨在结合两者的优势，提供高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: HyperSteer利用基于超网络的架构，根据自然语言导向提示和语言模型的内部状态，端到端生成导向向量。

Result: 实验表明，HyperSteer在数千个导向提示下性能优于最先进的激活导向方法，且与基于提示的导向方法表现相当。

Conclusion: HyperSteer通过结合超网络和自然语言提示，提供了一种高效、可扩展的语言模型导向方法。

Abstract: Steering language models (LMs) by modifying internal activations is a popular
approach for controlling text generation. Unsupervised dictionary learning
methods, e.g., sparse autoencoders, can be scaled to produce many steering
vectors, but lack guarantees on the individual efficacy of each vector and
control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks. In contrast, supervised
methods for constructing steering vectors are targeted and effective, but
require more data collection and training for each additional steering vector
produced. In this work, we introduce HyperSteer, a family of hypernetwork-based
architectures which are trained end-to-end to generate steering vectors
conditioned on the natural language steering prompts and the internals of the
steered LM. In our evaluations, we show that scaling HyperSteer with thousands
of steering prompts exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art activation
steering methods, even on steering prompts never seen during training.
Moreover, HyperSteer performs on par with steering-via-prompting.

### [5] [Unleashing the Reasoning Potential of Pre-trained LLMs by Critique Fine-Tuning on One Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03295)
*Yubo Wang,Ping Nie,Kai Zou,Lijun Wu,Wenhu Chen*

Key words: Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT), 大语言模型, 推理能力, 计算效率, 强化学习

TL;DR: 通过Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT)方法，仅在一个问题上进行微调即可显著提升大语言模型在推理任务中的表现，计算效率远高于强化学习（RL）。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但其计算成本高且不稳定，亟需一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用CFT方法，通过收集模型对单个问题的多样化解决方案并利用教师模型提供详细批评，构建微调数据。

Result: 在仅5 GPU小时的训练下，Qwen-Math-7B-CFT在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现平均提升15%-16%，计算效率为RL的20倍。

Conclusion: CFT是一种简单、通用且计算高效的替代方案，能够显著提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: We have witnessed that strong LLMs like Qwen-Math, MiMo, and Phi-4 possess
immense reasoning potential inherited from the pre-training stage. With
reinforcement learning (RL), these models can improve dramatically on reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have shown that even RL on a single problem can unleash
these models' reasoning capabilities. However, RL is not only expensive but
also unstable. Even one-shot RL requires hundreds of GPU hours. This raises a
critical question: Is there a more efficient way to unleash the reasoning
potential of these powerful base LLMs? In this work, we demonstrate that
Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT) on only one problem can effectively unleash the
reasoning potential of LLMs. Our method constructs critique data by collecting
diverse model-generated solutions to a single problem and using teacher LLMs to
provide detailed critiques. We fine-tune Qwen and Llama family models, ranging
from 1.5B to 14B parameters, on the CFT data and observe significant
performance gains across diverse reasoning tasks. For example, with just 5 GPU
hours of training, Qwen-Math-7B-CFT show an average improvement of 15% on six
math benchmarks and 16% on three logic reasoning benchmarks. These results are
comparable to or even surpass the results from RL with 20x less compute.
Ablation studies reveal the robustness of one-shot CFT across different prompt
problems. These results highlight one-shot CFT as a simple, general, and
compute-efficient approach to unleashing the reasoning capabilities of modern
LLMs.

Key words: 大型语言模型, ODRL, 知识图谱, 数据空间

TL;DR: 利用GPT-4等大型语言模型自动从自然语言指令生成ODRL使用政策，效果显著。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究如何通过大型语言模型自动生成ODRL政策，提升政策生成的效率和准确性。

Method: 利用ODRL本体及其文档作为提示核心，通过启发式方法指导和评估端到端知识图谱构建过程。

Result: 在12个复杂程度不同的用例中，生成的知识图谱准确率高达91.95%。

Conclusion: 通过优化本体文档指导政策生成是有效的，且在数据空间中表现出色。

Abstract: This study presents an approach that uses large language models such as GPT-4
to generate usage policies in the W3C Open Digital Rights Language ODRL
automatically from natural language instructions. Our approach uses the ODRL
ontology and its documentation as a central part of the prompt. Our research
hypothesis is that a curated version of existing ontology documentation will
better guide policy generation. We present various heuristics for adapting the
ODRL ontology and its documentation to guide an end-to-end KG construction
process. We evaluate our approach in the context of dataspaces, i.e.,
distributed infrastructures for trustworthy data exchange between multiple
participating organizations for the cultural domain. We created a benchmark
consisting of 12 use cases of varying complexity. Our evaluation shows
excellent results with up to 91.95% accuracy in the resulting knowledge graph.

### [7] [Hopscotch: Discovering and Skipping Redundancies in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03303)
*Mustafa Eyceoz,Nikhil Shivakumar Nayak,Hao Wang,Ligong Han,Akash Srivastava*

Key words: 模型优化, 注意力机制, 轻量级, 性能提升

TL;DR: Hopscotch是一种简单有效的方法，通过跳过贡献最小的注意力块并调整剩余层输出来优化模型性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现代因果语言模型堆叠大量注意力块以提高性能，但并非所有块对每个任务都是必要的。

Method: Hopscotch联合优化跳过哪些注意力块以及如何缩放剩余层的输出，引入轻量可训练的缩放参数以缓解隐藏状态分布偏移。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen2.5-7B上，Hopscotch在跳过四个注意力块后性能下降不到2%。

Conclusion: Hopscotch在不修改模型权重或依赖预训练数据的情况下，有效优化了模型性能。

Abstract: Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve
performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose
Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention
blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output
quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the
outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling
parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in
hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify
model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and
is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to
$\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than
a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.

### [8] [The Reader is the Metric: How Textual Features and Reader Profiles Explain Conflicting Evaluations of AI Creative Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03310)
*Guillermo Marco,Julio Gonzalo,Víctor Fresno*

Key words: AI创作, 人类创作, 文学质量, 读者偏好, 评价框架

TL;DR: 研究发现AI与人类创作的文学文本质量评价差异源于读者偏好不同，而非文本本身。通过分析读者偏好，揭示了两类读者群（表面关注型和整体型），并呼吁采用读者敏感的评价框架。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决AI与人类创作文学文本评价结果差异的问题，探究读者偏好如何影响文学质量评估。

Method: 使用五个公共数据集，提取17个文本特征，建模读者偏好，分析读者偏好向量。

Result: 读者分为两类：表面关注型（非专家）和整体型（专家），文学质量评价取决于文本特征与读者偏好的匹配程度。

Conclusion: 文学质量评价需考虑读者偏好，建议采用读者敏感的评价框架。

Abstract: Recent studies comparing AI-generated and human-authored literary texts have
produced conflicting results: some suggest AI already surpasses human quality,
while others argue it still falls short. We start from the hypothesis that such
divergences can be largely explained by genuine differences in how readers
interpret and value literature, rather than by an intrinsic quality of the
texts evaluated. Using five public datasets (1,471 stories, 101 annotators
including critics, students, and lay readers), we (i) extract 17 reference-less
textual features (e.g., coherence, emotional variance, average sentence
length...); (ii) model individual reader preferences, deriving feature
importance vectors that reflect their textual priorities; and (iii) analyze
these vectors in a shared "preference space". Reader vectors cluster into two
profiles: 'surface-focused readers' (mainly non-experts), who prioritize
readability and textual richness; and 'holistic readers' (mainly experts), who
value thematic development, rhetorical variety, and sentiment dynamics. Our
results quantitatively explain how measurements of literary quality are a
function of how text features align with each reader's preferences. These
findings advocate for reader-sensitive evaluation frameworks in the field of
creative text generation.

Key words: 暴力威胁,社交媒体,机器学习,跨平台数据集

TL;DR: 介绍了跨平台的暴力威胁数据集，并通过机器学习分析验证其有效性，结果表明不同平台的数据兼容性高。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 社交媒体暴力威胁是一个重要问题，高质量数据有助于研究和检测恶意内容。

Method: 引入3万条手工编码的暴力威胁帖子，与YouTube暴力评论数据集进行机器学习分析。

Result: 不同平台和编码标准下，分类准确率高，数据兼容性强。

Conclusion: 结果对内容分类策略和跨平台暴力内容理解有重要意义。

Abstract: Violent threats remain a significant problem across social media platforms.
Useful, high-quality data facilitates research into the understanding and
detection of malicious content, including violence. In this paper, we introduce
a cross-platform dataset of 30,000 posts hand-coded for violent threats and
sub-types of violence, including political and sexual violence. To evaluate the
signal present in this dataset, we perform a machine learning analysis with an
existing dataset of violent comments from YouTube. We find that, despite
originating from different platforms and using different coding criteria, we
achieve high classification accuracy both by training on one dataset and
testing on the other, and in a merged dataset condition. These results have
implications for content-classification strategies and for understanding
violent content across social media.

### [10] [Ask a Local: Detecting Hallucinations With Specialized Model Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03357)
*Aldan Creo,Héctor Cerezo-Costas,Pedro Alonso-Doval,Maximiliano Hormazábal-Lagos*

Key words: 大型语言模型、幻觉检测、困惑度、多语言、Ask a Local

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Ask a Local'的新型幻觉检测方法，通过利用专业化模型的困惑度分布差异来识别大型语言模型中的虚假信息，适用于多语言环境且无需额外训练或外部数据。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型生成虚假信息的问题，尤其是在多语言环境中的挑战。

Method: 计算语言专业化模型的困惑度分布差异，识别潜在虚构内容。方法无需适配或训练，适用于多种语言。

Result: 在14种语言的人类标注问答数据集上，表现稳定，IoU分数约为0.3，意大利语和加泰罗尼亚语表现尤佳（IoU分别为0.42和0.38）。

Conclusion: 该方法是多语言幻觉检测的有效工具，代码和架构已公开以促进研究。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) - instances where models
generate plausible but factually incorrect information - present a significant
challenge for AI.
  We introduce "Ask a Local", a novel hallucination detection method exploiting
the intuition that specialized models exhibit greater surprise when
encountering domain-specific inaccuracies. Our approach computes divergence
between perplexity distributions of language-specialized models to identify
potentially hallucinated spans. Our method is particularly well-suited for a
multilingual context, as it naturally scales to multiple languages without the
need for adaptation, relying on external data sources, or performing training.
Moreover, we select computationally efficient models, providing a scalable
solution that can be applied to a wide range of languages and domains.
  Our results on a human-annotated question-answer dataset spanning 14
languages demonstrate consistent performance across languages, with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU) scores around 0.3 and comparable Spearman
correlation values. Our model shows particularly strong performance on Italian
and Catalan, with IoU scores of 0.42 and 0.38, respectively, while maintaining
cross-lingual effectiveness without language-specific adaptations. We release
our code and architecture to facilitate further research in multilingual
hallucination detection.

*Zihui Ma,Lingyao Li,Juan Li,Wenyue Hua,Jingxiao Liu,Qingyuan Feng,Yuki Miura*

Key words: 灾害评估, 多模态大语言模型, 社交媒体, 实时数据分析, 地震

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的3M流程，用于灾害影响评估，结果表明MLLMs能有效整合图像和文本信号，但与语言、震中距离和输入模态相关。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 快速且细粒度的灾害损坏评估对应急响应至关重要，但由于地面传感器有限和官方报告延迟，传统方法难以应对。社交媒体的多模态和非结构化数据提供了实时的人为中心观测，但分析这些数据具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种结构化多模态、多语言和多维（3M）流程，利用MLLMs评估灾害影响，并在两次大地震事件中进行了宏观和微观分析。

Result: MLLMs能够有效整合图像和文本信号，并与真实地震数据高度相关，但性能受语言、震中距离和输入模态影响。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了MLLMs在灾害评估中的潜力，为未来在实时危机中应用MLLMs提供了基础。

Abstract: Rapid, fine-grained disaster damage assessment is essential for effective
emergency response, yet remains challenging due to limited ground sensors and
delays in official reporting. Social media provides a rich, real-time source of
human-centric observations, but its multimodal and unstructured nature presents
challenges for traditional analytical methods. In this study, we propose a
structured Multimodal, Multilingual, and Multidimensional (3M) pipeline that
leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to assess disaster impacts.
We evaluate three foundation models across two major earthquake events using
both macro- and micro-level analyses. Results show that MLLMs effectively
integrate image-text signals and demonstrate a strong correlation with
ground-truth seismic data. However, performance varies with language,
epicentral distance, and input modality. This work highlights the potential of
MLLMs for disaster assessment and provides a foundation for future research in
applying MLLMs to real-time crisis contexts. The code and data are released at:

Result: 提供了代表性方法和核心设计选择的分析，并指出开放挑战。

Conclusion: 桥接了自然语言处理与轨迹预测，展示了语言如何丰富轨迹预测。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in integrating language-driven techniques into trajectory prediction. By
leveraging their semantic and reasoning capabilities, LLMs are reshaping how
autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, categorizing recent
work into five directions: (1) Trajectory prediction via language modeling
paradigms, (2) Direct trajectory prediction with pretrained language models,
(3) Language-guided scene understanding for trajectory prediction, (4)
Language-driven data generation for trajectory prediction, (5) Language-based
reasoning and interpretability for trajectory prediction. For each, we analyze
representative methods, highlight core design choices, and identify open
challenges. This survey bridges natural language processing and trajectory
prediction, offering a unified perspective on how language can enrich
trajectory prediction.

TL;DR: DistRAG方法通过编码地理距离并检索相关子图，增强了大型语言模型（LLM）的空间推理能力。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型在空间推理任务（如POI推荐和行程规划）中表现不足，尤其在距离推理方面。

Method: 提出DistRAG方法，通过构建和检索地理距离子图来补充LLM的空间知识。

Result: 该方法使LLM能够回答原本无法处理的基于距离的推理问题。

Conclusion: DistRAG是初步为LLM提供世界模型以补充其语言知识的有效工具。

Abstract: Many real world tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used require
spatial reasoning, like Point of Interest (POI) recommendation and itinerary
planning. However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning
capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a
novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial
information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the
geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context
subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an
LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot
answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about,
DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world
model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示LLM如何习得和存储事实知识，以提高其可解释性和可靠性。

Method: 通过分类注意力头和FFN的角色，并跟踪其稳定性和转变，分析OLMo-7B模型的预训练过程。

Result: LLM初期依赖通用组件，后期专业化；注意力头角色变化频繁，FFN更稳定；基于位置的关系比基于名称的关系更早收敛。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了LLM知识形成的机制性见解。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) acquire and store factual
knowledge is crucial for enhancing their interpretability and reliability. In
this work, we analyze the evolution of factual knowledge representation in the
OLMo-7B model by tracking the roles of its attention heads and feed forward
networks (FFNs) over the course of pre-training. We classify these components
into four roles: general, entity, relation-answer, and fact-answer specific,
and examine their stability and transitions. Our results show that LLMs
initially depend on broad, general-purpose components, which later specialize
as training progresses. Once the model reliably predicts answers, some
components are repurposed, suggesting an adaptive learning process. Notably,
attention heads display the highest turnover. We also present evidence that
FFNs remain more stable throughout training. Furthermore, our probing
experiments reveal that location-based relations converge to high accuracy
earlier in training than name-based relations, highlighting how task complexity
shapes acquisition dynamics. These insights offer a mechanistic view of
knowledge formation in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 由于波斯语中有毒语言检测的研究较少，论文旨在填补这一空白，并通过比较不同方法，提升检测效果。

Method: 使用了微调、数据丰富化、零样本和小样本学习以及跨语言迁移学习等多种方法进行比较研究。

Result: 文化背景相似的源语言在迁移学习中对波斯语有毒语言检测的效果更好，而文化差异大的源语言提升较小。

Conclusion: 文化背景是影响跨语言迁移学习效果的重要因素，未来的研究应更注重文化相似性。

Abstract: Toxic language detection is crucial for creating safer online environments
and limiting the spread of harmful content. While toxic language detection has
been under-explored in Persian, the current work compares different methods for
this task, including fine-tuning, data enrichment, zero-shot and few-shot
learning, and cross-lingual transfer learning. What is especially compelling is
the impact of cultural context on transfer learning for this task: We show that
the language of a country with cultural similarities to Persian yields better
results in transfer learning. Conversely, the improvement is lower when the
language comes from a culturally distinct country. Warning: This paper contains
examples of toxic language that may disturb some readers. These examples are
included for the purpose of research on toxic detection.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究利用大型语言模型（LLM）从患者文本中诊断阿尔茨海默病（AD），以早期干预。

Method: 提出Delta-KNN策略，结合delta评分和KNN检索器，动态选择最优示范。

Result: 在三个开源LLM和两个AD数据集上，Delta-KNN表现优于现有ICL方法，甚至在Llama-3.1上超越监督分类器。

Conclusion: Delta-KNN能有效提升LLM在复杂任务（如AD诊断）中的性能。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
leads to dementia, and early intervention can greatly benefit from analyzing
linguistic abnormalities. In this work, we explore the potential of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as health assistants for AD diagnosis from
patient-generated text using in-context learning (ICL), where tasks are defined
through a few input-output examples. Empirical results reveal that conventional
ICL methods, such as similarity-based selection, perform poorly for AD
diagnosis, likely due to the inherent complexity of this task. To address this,
we introduce Delta-KNN, a novel demonstration selection strategy that enhances
ICL performance. Our method leverages a delta score to assess the relative
gains of each training example, coupled with a KNN-based retriever that
dynamically selects optimal "representatives" for a given input. Experiments on
two AD detection datasets across three open-source LLMs demonstrate that
Delta-KNN consistently outperforms existing ICL baselines. Notably, when using
the Llama-3.1 model, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results,
surpassing even supervised classifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在领域特定微调中可能降低通用能力的问题，提出一种新的平衡方法。

Method: APT方法通过自生成弱项数据（坏案例和相似案例），仅对错误样本进行针对性训练，保留模型通用能力。

Result: 在LLama-2和Mistral-V0.3模型上，APT在不影响通用能力的情况下提升了领域任务表现。

Conclusion: APT是一种有效的策略，可在不牺牲模型通用能力的情况下增强领域特定性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often require domain-specific fine-tuning to
address targeted tasks, which risks degrading their general capabilities.
Maintaining a balance between domain-specific enhancements and general model
utility is a key challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach named APT
(Weakness Case Acquisition and Iterative Preference Training) to enhance
domain-specific performance with self-generated dis-preferred weakness data
(bad cases and similar cases). APT uniquely focuses on training the model using
only those samples where errors occur, alongside a small, similar set of
samples retrieved for this purpose. This targeted training minimizes
interference with the model's existing knowledge base, effectively retaining
generic capabilities. Experimental results on the LLama-2 and Mistral-V0.3
models across various benchmarks demonstrate that APT ensures no reduction in
generic capacity and achieves superior performance on downstream tasks compared
to various existing methods. This validates our method as an effective strategy
for enhancing domain-specific capabilities without sacrificing the model's
broader applicability.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 标记数据稀缺是AI模型开发的主要挑战，传统数据增强技术存在噪声、语义漂移、缺乏控制等问题，XAI为解决这些问题提供了新思路。

Method: 提出XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation框架，结合XAI技术和迭代反馈循环，优化增强数据的生成过程。

Result: 实验显示，XAI-SR-BT和XAI-PR-BT在仇恨言论和情感分析任务中分别比基线模型提升6.6%和8.1%，且优于传统增强技术4.8%和5%。

Conclusion: 该研究为数据增强提供了更可控、可解释且情境感知的解决方案，开启了利用XAI技术增强AI模型训练的新范式。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving the
performance of AI models, going beyond providing model transparency and
interpretability. The scarcity of labeled data remains a fundamental challenge
in developing robust and generalizable AI models, particularly for low-resource
languages. Conventional data augmentation techniques introduce noise, cause
semantic drift, disrupt contextual coherence, lack control, and lead to
overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose XAI-Guided Context-Aware
Data Augmentation. This novel framework leverages XAI techniques to modify less
critical features while selectively preserving most task-relevant features. Our
approach integrates an iterative feedback loop, which refines augmented data
over multiple augmentation cycles based on explainability-driven insights and
the model performance gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that XAI-SR-BT
and XAI-PR-BT improve the accuracy of models on hate speech and sentiment
analysis tasks by 6.6% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline, using
the Amharic dataset with the XLM-R model. XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT outperform
existing augmentation techniques by 4.8% and 5%, respectively, on the same
dataset and model. Overall, XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT consistently outperform
both baseline and conventional augmentation techniques across all tasks and
models. This study provides a more controlled, interpretable, and context-aware
solution to data augmentation, addressing critical limitations of existing
augmentation techniques and offering a new paradigm shift for leveraging XAI
techniques to enhance AI model training.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的性能依赖于大量高质量标注数据，但数据获取成本高昂，限制了模型在下游任务中的表现。

Method: EpiCoDe结合模型外推和对比解码，通过比较外推模型和原始微调模型的逻辑分数，减少预测错误。

Result: 在三项任务和四种大型语言模型上的实验表明，EpiCoDe显著且稳定地优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EpiCoDe为数据稀缺场景下的模型优化提供了有效解决方案，并通过理论框架揭示了对比解码的机制。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on
the availability of abundant high-quality training data. However, the high cost
of acquiring annotated data often prevents models from obtaining capabilities
to tackle downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, EpiCoDe
that boosts model performance in data-scarcity scenarios without extra
training. We first employ model extrapolation to enhance a finetuned model with
its inferior version, and then adopt contrastive decoding to further reduce
predicted errors, by comparing the logit scores given by the extrapolated and
the vanilla finetuned model. Experiments across three tasks over four different
LLMs show that EpiCoDe consistently outperforms existing methods with
significant and robust improvement. We also propose a new theoretical framework
to reveal the mechanism behind contrastive decoding in data-scarcity scenarios,
which further helps us better understand the effectiveness of EpiCoDe.

Motivation: 尽管知识编辑在通用领域表现良好，但在复杂的医学领域尚未充分验证，需要内部化知识并泛化到未见场景以实现有效决策。

Method: 提出MedEditBench框架，包含新医学知识编辑基准和三种编辑范式；提出SGR-Edit，利用模型生成的理由作为编辑目标。

Result: 现有KE方法仅实现浅层记忆，SGR-Edit显著优于现有方法，并提供医学知识定位和顺序编辑影响的深入见解。

Conclusion: SGR-Edit通过揭示推理过程改进医学知识编辑效果，为实际应用提供指导。

Abstract: Recently, knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a promising approach to
update specific facts in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for full
retraining. Despite the effectiveness in general-domain benchmarks, their
applicability to complex medical domain remains largely unexplored. Medical
knowledge editing is particularly challenging, as it requires LLMs to
internalize the knowledge and generalize to unseen scenarios for effective and
interpretable decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel framework
called MedEditBench to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of existing KE
methods in the medical domain. In MedEditBench, we introduce a new medical
knowledge editing benchmark as well as three different knowledge editing
paradigms, which are designed to assess the impact of different knowledge
sources for editing. Our findings indicate that current KE methods result in
only superficial memorization of the injected information, failing to
generalize to new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present
Self-Generated Rationale Editing (SGR-Edit), which utilizes model-derived
rationales as the target knowledge for editing, thereby uncovering the
underlying reasoning process and demonstrating significant improvements over
existing KE approaches. Additionally, we offer deeper insights into medical
knowledge editing, including the localization of medical knowledge in LLMs and
the impact of sequential editing on evolving knowledge. This could provide
practical guidance for implementing KE methods in real-world medical
applications.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的普及，AI生成文本的使用增加，但现有的检测方法多为二进制分类，无法准确反映人类参与的多样性。

Method: 使用BERTScore作为指标，结合多任务RoBERTa回归器，通过标记分类任务训练，检测文本中人类参与的程度。

Result: 在模拟学术场景的数据集上，方法表现出色（F1分数0.9423，回归器均方误差0.004），且具有一定的跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测人类参与程度，弥补了现有二进制分类方法的不足，适用于人类与AI协作生成的文本。

Abstract: Content creation has dramatically progressed with the rapid advancement of
large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. While this progress has greatly
enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected
certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college
students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most
countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary
classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human
involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine
collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people
may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies
case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory
approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We
propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the
generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token
classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of
this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous
dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing
detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this
dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor
mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability
across generative models. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)推理速度慢限制了其广泛应用，现有子层修剪方法因忽视子层特性导致精度下降。

Method: SPRINT结合延迟减少量和子层可调性信息，迭代修剪冗余子层并快速调整剩余子层参数。

Result: SPRINT在零样本常识推理基准上比现有方法精度提高23.88%，实现最佳精度-加速比。

Conclusion: SPRINT是一种高效的LLM子层修剪方法，显著提升了推理速度和精度。

Abstract: How can we accelerate large language models(LLMs) without sacrificing
accuracy? The slow inference speed of LLMs hinders us to benefit from their
remarkable performance in diverse applications. This is mainly because numerous
sublayers are stacked together in LLMs. Sublayer pruning compresses and
expedites LLMs via removing unnecessary sublayers. However, existing sublayer
pruning algorithms are limited in accuracy since they naively select sublayers
to prune, overlooking the different characteristics of each sublayer. In this
paper, we propose SPRINT (Sublayer PRuning wIth LateNcy and Tunability
Information), an accurate sublayer pruning method for LLMs. SPRINT accurately
selects a target sublayer to prune by considering 1) the amount of latency
reduction after pruning and 2) the tunability of sublayers. SPRINT iteratively
prunes redundant sublayers and swiftly tunes the parameters of remaining
sublayers. Experiments show that SPRINT achieves the best accuracy-speedup
trade-off, exhibiting up to 23.88%p higher accuracy on zero-shot commonsense
reasoning benchmarks compared to existing pruning algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: DRL在任务导向对话系统中难以平衡探索与开发，容易陷入局部最优。EA能有效探索解空间，因此结合两者以优化性能。

Method: 提出了一种结合EA的全局搜索能力和DRL的局部优化能力的方法，并引入EII机制以提升EA的搜索效率。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了探索与开发的平衡和性能，EII机制还缩短了探索时间。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了EA与DRL的高效结合，优化了任务导向对话系统的性能。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used in task-oriented dialogue
systems to optimize dialogue policy, but it struggles to balance exploration
and exploitation due to the high dimensionality of state and action spaces.
This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary
Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of
neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we
innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local
optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation.
Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks
complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times.
Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance
EA's search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals
into the population. Experiments across four datasets show that our approach
significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation,
boosting performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the EII mechanism in
reducing exploration time has been demonstrated, achieving an efficient
integration of EA and DRL on task-oriented dialogue policy tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为TokAlign的高效方法，通过词汇替换和知识迁移改进LLM的tokenizer性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 在LLM中，tokenizer的不效率会拖慢训练和生成速度，词汇不匹配也阻碍知识迁移。

Method: TokAlign通过一对一的token ID映射矩阵对齐词汇，调整模型参数并逐步微调。

Result: 方法显著提升了多语言文本压缩率和词汇初始化效果，困惑度从3.4e²降至1.2e²。

Conclusion: TokAlign在多样本上表现出有效性和泛化性，仅需5k步即可恢复性能。

Abstract: Tokenization serves as a foundational step for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to process text. In new domains or languages, the inefficiency of the tokenizer
will slow down the training and generation of LLM. The mismatch in vocabulary
also hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level
distillation. To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named
TokAlign to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view,
and further transfer the token-level knowledge between models. It first aligns
the source vocabulary to the target one by learning a one-to-one mapping matrix
for token IDs. Model parameters, including embeddings, are rearranged and
progressively fine-tuned for the new vocabulary. Our method significantly
improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for
LLMs, decreasing the perplexity from 3.4$\text{e}^2$ of strong baseline methods
to 1.2$\text{e}^2$ after initialization. Experimental results on models across
multiple parameter scales demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of
TokAlign, which costs as few as 5k steps to restore the performance of the
vanilla model. After unifying vocabularies between LLMs, token-level
distillation can remarkably boost (+4.4% than sentence-level distillation) the
base model, costing only 235M tokens.

Result: Seed-Coder在类似规模的开源模型中表现最佳，甚至超越某些更大的模型。

Conclusion: Seed-Coder证明了减少人工干预、依赖模型中心的方案在代码相关任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Code data in large language model (LLM) pretraining is recognized crucial not
only for code-related tasks but also for enhancing general intelligence of
LLMs. Current open-source LLMs often heavily rely on human effort to produce
their code pretraining data, such as employing hand-crafted filtering rules
tailored to individual programming languages, or using human-annotated data to
train quality filters. However, these approaches are inherently limited in
scalability, prone to subjective biases, and costly to extend and maintain
across diverse programming languages. To address these challenges, we introduce
Seed-Coder, a series of open-source LLMs comprising base, instruct and
reasoning models of 8B size, minimizing human involvement in data construction.
Our code pretraining data is produced by a model-centric data pipeline, which
predominantly leverages LLMs for scoring and filtering code data. The instruct
model is further trained via supervised fine-tuning and preference
optimization, and the reasoning model leverages Long-Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT)
reinforcement learning to improve multi-step code reasoning. Seed-Coder
achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size and
even surpasses some much larger models, demonstrating superior performance in
code generation, code completion, code editing, code reasoning, and software
engineering tasks.

Conclusion: Go-Browse提供了一种高效的数据收集框架，显著提升了数字代理的任务成功率。

Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in digital agents is their lack of
understanding of their environment. For instance, a web browsing agent may get
lost in unfamiliar websites, uncertain what pages must be visited to achieve
its goals. To address this, we propose Go-Browse, a method for automatically
collecting diverse and realistic web agent data at scale through structured
exploration of web environments. Go-Browse achieves efficient exploration by
framing data collection as a graph search, enabling reuse of information across
exploration episodes. We instantiate our method on the WebArena benchmark,
collecting a dataset of 10K successful task-solving trajectories and 40K
interaction steps across 100 URLs. Fine-tuning a 7B parameter language model on
this dataset achieves a success rate of 21.7% on the WebArena benchmark,
beating GPT-4o mini by 2.4% and exceeding current state-of-the-art results for
sub-10B parameter models by 2.9%.

Result: 在不同NLP基准测试中表现出色，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 此方法为小模型的高效训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to set new standards in
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks, yet their high computational
demands limit widespread adoption. While distilling large models into smaller
ones offers a sustainable solution, current techniques--such as static
knowledge distillation, resource-intensive reinforcement learning from human
feedback, or limited self-reflection--struggle to yield substantial and lasting
performance gains. In this paper, we present a novel Debate and Reflect (D&R)
framework that orchestrates multi-turn debates between smaller models and
stronger teacher models, eliciting actionable feedback (e.g., error analysis,
corrective strategies) to guide student models. Further, we introduce
Tree-structured Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) to efficiently leverage
these debate logs, organizing interactions into a hierarchical format for
effective training. Empirical evaluations across diverse NLP benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves smaller-model accuracy,
robustness, and generalization, outperforming conventional baselines by a large
margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: DPO在优化LLM时保留了选择与拒绝响应的相对顺序，但忽略了奖励绝对值，导致DCR问题，降低了选择响应的概率和模型表现。BPO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BPO通过平衡奖励边际和间隙适配器动态优化选择与拒绝响应，无需在损失函数中引入额外约束。

Result: 在多个数学推理任务中，BPO显著优于DPO及其变种，准确率提升高达+11.7%，且仅需单行代码修改即可实现。

Conclusion: BPO简单高效地解决了DPO的DCR问题，同时兼容现有框架，为LLM对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as a popular method for
aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While DPO
effectively preserves the relative ordering between chosen and rejected
responses through pairwise ranking losses, it often neglects absolute reward
magnitudes. This oversight can decrease the likelihood of chosen responses and
increase the risk of generating out-of-distribution responses, leading to poor
performance. We term this issue Degraded Chosen Responses (DCR).To address this
issue, we propose Balanced Preference Optimization (BPO), a novel framework
that dynamically balances the optimization of chosen and rejected responses
through two key components: balanced reward margin and gap adaptor. Unlike
previous methods, BPO can fundamentally resolve DPO's DCR issue, without
introducing additional constraints to the loss function. Experimental results
on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks show that BPO significantly
outperforms DPO, improving accuracy by +10.1% with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (18.8%
to 28.9%) and +11.7% with Qwen2.5-Math-7B (35.0% to 46.7%). It also surpasses
DPO variants by +3.6% over IPO (43.1%), +5.0% over SLiC (41.7%), and +3.1% over
Cal-DPO (43.6%) on the same model. Remarkably, our algorithm requires only a
single line of code modification, making it simple to implement and fully
compatible with existing DPO-based frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于骨架引导的多轮对话生成框架，通过明确建模人类对话意图解决现有单轮指令合成方法在多轮对话中的上下文漂移和任务完成率低的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的指令合成方法主要关注单轮指令，忽视了多轮对话的跨轮连贯性，导致上下文漂移和任务完成率下降。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：(1)意图建模，通过将对话分类到九种预定义的意图轨迹中，确保连贯性；(2)骨架生成，构建与意图对齐的用户查询序列作为后续指令合成的约束。

Result: 构建了ConsistentChat数据集（15,000对话，224,392条语句），实验显示其在Light、Topdial和MT-Eval基准测试中，聊天一致性和任务成功率分别提升20-30%和15%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了多轮对话的连贯性和任务完成率，优于现有单轮和多轮指令数据集训练模型。

Abstract: Current instruction data synthesis methods primarily focus on single-turn
instructions and often neglect cross-turn coherence, resulting in context drift
and reduced task completion rates in extended conversations. To address this
limitation, we propose Skeleton-Guided Multi-Turn Dialogue Generation, a
framework that constrains multi-turn instruction synthesis by explicitly
modeling human conversational intent. It operates in two stages: (1) Intent
Modeling, which captures the global structure of human dialogues by assigning
each conversation to one of nine well-defined intent trajectories, ensuring a
coherent and goal-oriented information flow; and (2) Skeleton Generation, which
constructs a structurally grounded sequence of user queries aligned with the
modeled intent, thereby serving as a scaffold that constrains and guides the
downstream instruction synthesis process. Based on this process, we construct
ConsistentChat, a multi-turn instruction dataset with approximately 15,000
multi-turn conversations and 224,392 utterances. Experiments on the Light,
Topdial, and MT-Eval benchmarks show that models fine-tuned on ConsistentChat
achieve a 20-30% improvement in chat consistency and up to a 15% increase in
task success rate, significantly outperforming models trained on existing
single-turn and multi-turn instruction datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为PosS的方法，通过多个位置专用的草稿层来改进推测解码中的草稿模型预测质量，显著提升了后期位置的令牌接受率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法因草稿模型生成特征的错误积累，导致后期令牌预测质量下降，需改进。

Method: PosS使用多个位置专用的草稿层（Position Specialists），每个层专注于处理特定位置的草稿模型特征偏差。

Result: 实验表明，PosS在多个数据集上显著提升了平均接受长度和加速比。

Conclusion: PosS通过专用草稿层有效解决了后期令牌预测质量下降问题，提升了LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by
using a small draft model to predict multiple tokens, and a large target model
to verify these tokens in parallel. Recent studies leverage the hidden state of
the target model to enhance draft model prediction accuracy. However, existing
methods suffer from the degrading quality of draft token predictions at later
positions, due to error accumulation in draft model generated features. In this
paper, we propose Position Specialists (PosS), which consist of multiple
position-specialized draft layers to generate tokens at assigned position(s).
Position specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions
per drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a
certain level of draft model feature deviation. Experiment results on
Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat across six datasets demonstrate that
PosS effectively improves over baselines on average acceptance length and
speed-up ratio. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/shrango/PosS.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决训练过程奖励模型（PRM）需要高成本步骤级标注的问题。

Method: 生成伪步骤级标签并结合缓冲概率消除噪声。

Result: 在ProcessBench上平均F1得分为53.0%，优于多个现有PRM模型。

Conclusion: FreePRM为PRM训练提供新范式，减少对标注的依赖并保持高性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a crucial role in enhancing model
performance. However, training PRMs typically requires step-level labels,
either manually annotated or automatically generated, which can be costly and
difficult to obtain at scale. To address this challenge, we introduce FreePRM,
a weakly supervised framework for training PRMs without access to ground-truth
step-level labels. FreePRM first generates pseudo step-level labels based on
the correctness of final outcome, and then employs Buffer Probability to
eliminate impact of noise inherent in pseudo labeling. Experimental results
show that FreePRM achieves an average F1 score of 53.0% on ProcessBench,
outperforming fully supervised PRM trained on Math-Shepherd by +24.1%. Compared
to other open-source PRMs, FreePRM outperforms upon RLHFlow-PRM-Mistral-8B
(28.4%) by +24.6%, EurusPRM (31.3%) by +21.7%, and Skywork-PRM-7B (42.1%) by
+10.9%. This work introduces a new paradigm in PRM training, significantly
reducing reliance on costly step-level annotations while maintaining strong

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但其性能受限于对问题的固有理解，需要一种方法来突破这种限制。

Method: 提出了EoP框架，通过交换问题定义视角来增强模型的理解能力和灵活性。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，EoP显著提升了模型性能。例如，使用GPT-3.5-Turbo时，AQuA任务准确率提升3.6%；使用GPT-4时，Math任务整体准确率提升7.7%。

Conclusion: EoP框架通过视角交换有效突破了模型对问题的固有思维限制，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in addressing
diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performance is
often limited by inherent comprehension of problems. To address this
limitation, we propose Exchange-of-Perspective (EoP), a novel framework
designed to exchange perspectives across different definitions of problem, so
that it can break the fixed mindset from any particular formulation of the
question. We conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on 8 benchmarks.
The results show that EoP can significantly improve performance. For instance,
compared to the non-commutative baseline PHP, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and EoP, we
observe a 3.6% improvement on AQuA (60.6% to 64.2%), while GPT-4-powered EoP
demonstrates a 7.7% overall accuracy enhancement on Math (53.9% to 61.6%) and a
3.5% improvement on OlympiadBench Maths (43.5% to 47.0%) when using

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独关注知识图谱结构或文本语义，缺乏一个统一框架以同时捕捉全局图谱连通性、细微语言上下文和判别性推理语义。

Method: 提出了KG-BiLM框架，包含三个关键组件：(i)双向知识注意力；(ii)知识掩码预测；(iii)对比图语义聚合。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，KG-BiLM在链接预测任务中表现优异，尤其在大规模多跳关系图谱上。

Conclusion: KG-BiLM有效统一了结构信息和文本语义，验证了其优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the
urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models
(LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically
prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a
unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced
linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap,
we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues
from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM
incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which
removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and
entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to
leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii)
Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via
contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong
baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex
multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural
information and textual semantics.

Motivation: 提供多样且匹配学习者水平的例句对语言学习至关重要，研究旨在利用预训练语言模型优化例句生成。

Method: 使用预训练语言模型进行例句质量评分（检索系统）和零样本学习直接生成例句，并评估句子难度、多样性和自然度。

Result: 尽管评估者对句子质量的评分存在分歧（除难度外），检索方法普遍更受欢迎，生成方法得分较低。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型在提升例句建议系统适应性方面具有潜力，有助于改善语言学习体验。

Abstract: Providing example sentences that are diverse and aligned with learners'
proficiency levels is essential for fostering effective language acquisition.
This study examines the use of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to produce
example sentences targeting L2 Japanese learners. We utilize PLMs in two ways:
as quality scoring components in a retrieval system that draws from a newly
curated corpus of Japanese sentences, and as direct sentence generators using
zero-shot learning. We evaluate the quality of sentences by considering
multiple aspects such as difficulty, diversity, and naturalness, with a panel
of raters consisting of learners of Japanese, native speakers -- and GPT-4. Our
findings suggest that there is inherent disagreement among participants on the
ratings of sentence qualities, except for difficulty. Despite that, the
retrieval approach was preferred by all evaluators, especially for beginner and
advanced target proficiency, while the generative approaches received lower
scores on average. Even so, our experiments highlight the potential for using
PLMs to enhance the adaptability of sentence suggestion systems and therefore
improve the language learning journey.

Motivation: 在LLM训练中，生成式任务（如推理和代码生成）的评估耗时且计算量大，因此需要一种更高效的方法来监控关键能力的发展。

Method: 将生成式任务重新设计为计算成本较低的选择式任务，并在不同大小和能力的8种LM上进行性能相关性测试。

Result: 生成式和选择式任务之间存在强相关性，评估时间平均减少超过35倍。

Conclusion: 通过选择式任务可以有效评估LLM的关键能力，显著降低评估成本。

Abstract: Iterative evaluation of LLMs during training is essential to ensure expected
capability development, but can be time- and compute-intensive. While NLU
tasks, where the model selects from fixed answer choices, are cheap to
evaluate, essential capabilities like reasoning and code generation rely on the
more time-consuming NLG (token-by-token generation) format. In this work, our
aim is to decrease the computational burden of NLG benchmarks in order to
enable monitoring crucial LLM capabilities during model training. We
reformulate generative tasks into computationally cheaper NLU alternatives. We
test the performance correlation between the original and reformulated tasks
using 8 LMs of various sizes and 4 capabilities: mathematical reasoning, code
generation, factual knowledge and reading comprehension. Our results show a
strong correlation between task formats, supporting capability assessment via
cheaper alternatives and achieving over 35x average reduction in evaluation
time. We plan to publish our benchmark adaptions.

Result: 语言相关的策略在生成数据与训练分布相似时表现更好。

Conclusion: 语言相关的数据增强策略需确保生成数据与训练分布相似才能优于语言无关策略。

Abstract: Data augmentation, a widely-employed technique for addressing data scarcity,
involves generating synthetic data examples which are then used to augment
available training data. Researchers have seen surprising success from simple
methods, such as random perturbations from natural examples, where models seem
to benefit even from data with nonsense words, or data that doesn't conform to
the rules of the language. A second line of research produces synthetic data
that does in fact follow all linguistic constraints; these methods require some
linguistic expertise and are generally more challenging to implement. No
previous work has done a systematic, empirical comparison of both
linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated data augmentation strategies,
leaving uncertainty about whether the additional time and effort of
linguistically-motivated data augmentation work in fact yields better
downstream performance.
  In this work, we conduct a careful and comprehensive comparison of
augmentation strategies (both linguistically-naive and
linguistically-motivated) for two low-resource languages with different
morphological properties, Uspanteko and Arapaho. We evaluate the effectiveness
of many different strategies and their combinations across two important
sequence-to-sequence tasks for low-resource languages: machine translation and
interlinear glossing. We find that linguistically-motivated strategies can have
benefits over naive approaches, but only when the new examples they produce are
not significantly unlike the training data distribution.

Conclusion: AP-SQL成功弥合了小型开源模型与大型闭源模型之间的能力差距，为资源受限环境提供了高效的Text-to-SQL解决方案。

Abstract: Using the best Text-to-SQL methods in resource-constrained environments is
challenging due to their reliance on resource-intensive open-source models.
This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to
bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the
powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL

retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and
prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection
accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the
impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly
enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive
evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上实现显著性能提升，如GSM8K准确率提高4.7%p，MBPP pass@1提高3.4%p。

Conclusion: DIT是一种基于模型的动态方法，为推理研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: To enhance reasoning capabilities, previous works have explored incorporating
special-purpose tokens into the training process. These strategies strengthen
the learning mechanism of transformer-based large language models (LLMs).
Building on prior research, in which inserting dummy tokens consecutively just
before reasoning steps can enhance effectiveness, we introduce a novel approach
termed Dynamic Inserting Tokens Training (DIT). Our method identifies positions
within sequences where model confidence is lowest according to token
log-likelihood. Strategically inserting [PAUSE] tokens on these positions
bolsters the model's predictive capabilities for subsequent tokens.
Experimental results across diverse datasets and models, from the 2.7B model to
the 8B model, demonstrate that DIT consistently outperforms traditional
fine-tuning and previous token insertion methods. With this simple yet
effective method, we achieve accuracy gains of up to 4.7%p on GSM8K, 3.23%p on
AQUA-RAT, and pass@1 improvements of up to 3.4%p on MBPP datasets. Our work
shows a model-based, dynamic approach rather than a heuristic one, thereby
broadening the scope of research in reasoning.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的文化意识，特别是非英语社区的文化知识，如日本妖怪故事。

Method: 引入包含809道多选题的YokaiEval基准数据集，测试31种日语和多语言LLMs。

Result: 日语训练的模型表现优于英语模型，尤其是基于Llama-3的持续预训练模型。

Conclusion: 日语训练的资源对LLMs的文化知识理解至关重要，YokaiEval为文化意识评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong language
understanding and generation abilities across various languages, their cultural
knowledge is often limited to English-speaking communities, which can
marginalize the cultures of non-English communities. To address the problem,
evaluation of the cultural awareness of the LLMs and the methods to develop
culturally aware LLMs have been investigated. In this study, we focus on
evaluating knowledge of folktales, a key medium for conveying and circulating
culture. In particular, we focus on Japanese folktales, specifically on
knowledge of Yokai. Yokai are supernatural creatures originating from Japanese
folktales that continue to be popular motifs in art and entertainment today.
Yokai have long served as a medium for cultural expression, making them an
ideal subject for assessing the cultural awareness of LLMs. We introduce
YokaiEval, a benchmark dataset consisting of 809 multiple-choice questions
(each with four options) designed to probe knowledge about yokai. We evaluate
the performance of 31 Japanese and multilingual LLMs on this dataset. The
results show that models trained with Japanese language resources achieve
higher accuracy than English-centric models, with those that underwent
continued pretraining in Japanese, particularly those based on Llama-3,
performing especially well. The code and dataset are available at

Result: 实验证明RoP显著提升LLMs对抗扰动能力，几乎不降低干净输入的性能。

Conclusion: RoP是一种实用有效的提示策略，适用于增强LLMs的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various tasks by effectively utilizing a prompting strategy. However, they are
highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight
character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance.
Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that
explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open
challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a
novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of
LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error
Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate
adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that
automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an
optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model
toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments
spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial
perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal
degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a
practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world
applications.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型通常基于固定偏好数据集训练，难以适应多样化需求，且任务特定数据的收集和重新训练成本高昂。

Method: 提出RewardAnything模型，设计为遵循动态提供的自然语言奖励原则，并开发RABench评估其普适性。

Result: RewardAnything在传统任务和RABench上均表现优异，无需重新训练即可适应新原则，并能高效对齐LLMs。

Conclusion: RewardAnything通过自然语言原则实现了奖励模型的通用性和高效性，为LLM优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are
typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to
single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse
real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in
another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and
retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards,
and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable,
principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and
adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward
principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this
capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on
generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor
generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a
novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles.
We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark
simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we
excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore,
RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by
a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only
natural language principles.

Motivation: 随着LLM在医疗领域的应用增加，确保其响应的可靠性对临床决策和患者安全至关重要。然而，医疗数据的复杂性和临床场景的严肃性使得实现全面信任的QA系统充满挑战。

Method: 通过系统回顾和比较现有LLM医疗QA系统在六个信任维度的评估方法、基准测试和技术改进措施（如检索增强、对抗微调和安全对齐）。

Result: 总结了当前评估技术的局限性，并提出未来研究方向，如专家评估的扩展、多维度综合指标和实际部署研究。

Abstract: Trustworthiness in healthcare question-answering (QA) systems is important
for ensuring patient safety, clinical effectiveness, and user confidence. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into medical
settings, the reliability of their responses directly influences clinical
decision-making and patient outcomes. However, achieving comprehensive
trustworthiness in medical QA poses significant challenges due to the inherent
complexity of healthcare data, the critical nature of clinical scenarios, and
the multifaceted dimensions of trustworthy AI. In this survey, we
systematically examine six key dimensions of trustworthiness in medical QA,
i.e., Factuality, Robustness, Fairness, Safety, Explainability, and
Calibration. We review how each dimension is evaluated in existing LLM-based
medical QA systems. We compile and compare major benchmarks designed to assess
these dimensions and analyze evaluation-guided techniques that drive model
improvements, such as retrieval-augmented grounding, adversarial fine-tuning,
and safety alignment. Finally, we identify open challenges-such as scalable
expert evaluation, integrated multi-dimensional metrics, and real-world
deployment studies-and propose future research directions to advance the safe,
reliable, and transparent deployment of LLM-powered medical QA.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前VQA系统在处理视障人士拍摄的文本图像时表现不佳，尤其是文本方向不正确的情况。

Method: 提出ROtated SAmpling (ROSA)解码策略，用于提升VQA系统在文本方向不正确场景下的性能。

Result: ROSA在表现最佳模型中比贪婪解码策略提升了11.7个绝对百分点。

Conclusion: ROSA有效解决了VQA系统在处理视障人士拍摄的文本图像时的局限性。

Abstract: Visually impaired people could benefit from Visual Question Answering (VQA)
systems to interpret text in their surroundings. However, current models often
struggle with recognizing text in the photos taken by this population. Through
in-depth interviews with visually impaired individuals, we identified common
framing conventions that frequently result in misaligned text. Existing VQA
benchmarks primarily feature well-oriented text captured by sighted users,
under-representing these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce ROtated
SAmpling (ROSA), a decoding strategy that enhances VQA performance in text-rich
images with incorrectly oriented text. ROSA outperforms Greedy decoding by 11.7
absolute points in the best-performing model.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决小型组织在有限标注数据和计算资源下对预训练ASR模型进行微调的挑战。

Method: 结合Word Error Rate (WER)预测、命名实体识别(NER)和Character Error Rate (CER)分析，筛选高质量训练片段。

Result: 在7500小时的伪标注数据上微调实现12.3% WER，筛选至100小时（1.4%）数据集性能相近；Fisher English实验结果类似。

Conclusion: 所提方法能显著减少训练数据需求，同时保持ASR性能，适用于资源有限场景。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging for
small organizations with limited labeled data and computational resources.
Here, we explore different data selection pipelines and propose a robust
approach that improves ASR adaptation by filtering pseudo-labels generated
using Whisper (encoder-decoder) and Zipformer (transducer) models. Our approach
integrates multiple selection strategies -- including word error rate (WER)
prediction, named entity recognition (NER), and character error rate (CER)
analysis -- to extract high-quality training segments. We evaluate our method
on Whisper and Zipformer using a 7500-hour baseline, comparing it to a
CER-based approach relying on hypotheses from three ASR systems. Fine-tuning on
7500 hours of pseudo-labeled call center data achieves 12.3% WER, while our
filtering reduces the dataset to 100 hours (1.4%) with similar performance; a
similar trend is observed on Fisher English.

Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖数据质量，但数据噪声影响效果，需改进。

Method: 引入γ-PO，动态校准奖励边界，优先高置信度对，抑制噪声。

Result: 在AlpacaEval2和Arena-Hard上平均提升4.4%，且兼容现有DPO。

Conclusion: γ-PO高效稳健，提升LLM对齐性能，代码改动小。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their
safety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes
models using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands.
However, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is
frequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose $\gamma$-PO, a
dynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward
margins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin
calibration, $\gamma$-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those
demonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from
ambiguous pairs. Moreover, $\gamma$-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible
with variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs.
Across benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, $\gamma$-PO achieves an
average 4.4\% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for
state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, $\gamma$-PO requires minimal code
changes and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust
solution for enhancing LLMs alignment. Our codes are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出AdaDecode方法，通过自适应在中间层生成高置信度令牌，并行计算剩余层，加速大语言模型解码，确保输出一致性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前自回归解码的效率受限，无法充分利用硬件的并行能力，现有方法如推测解码和层跳过存在模型依赖或输出不一致问题。

Method: AdaDecode利用中间层高置信度令牌生成，并行计算剩余层，并通过验证步骤确保输出一致性。

Result: AdaDecode在多样生成任务中实现最高1.73倍的解码速度提升，且输出与标准自回归解码一致。

Conclusion: AdaDecode无需辅助模型或修改参数，显著提升解码效率且保证输出质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-content
generation (e.g., long Chain-of-Thought reasoning) where decoding efficiency
becomes a critical bottleneck: Autoregressive decoding is inherently limited by
its sequential token generation process, where each token must be generated
before the next can be processed. This sequential dependency restricts the
ability to fully leverage modern hardware's parallel processing capabilities.
Existing methods like speculative decoding and layer skipping offer potential
speedups but have notable drawbacks: speculative decoding relies on an
auxiliary "drafter" model, which can be challenging to acquire and increases
memory overhead, while layer skipping may introduce discrepancies in the
outputs due to the missing key-value cache at skipped layers. In this work, we
propose AdaDecode, which accelerates LLM decoding without requiring auxiliary
models or changes to the original model parameters, while ensuring output
consistency. AdaDecode leverages the insight that many tokens can accurately be
generated at intermediate layers, as further layers often do not significantly
alter predictions once the model reaches a certain confidence. By adaptively
generating tokens at intermediate layers when confidence is high, AdaDecode
enables the next token's computation to begin immediately. The remaining layer
computations for early-predicted tokens are deferred and executed in parallel
with subsequent tokens when needed, maximizing hardware utilization and
reducing decoding latency. A final verification step ensures that early
predictions match the results of standard autoregressive decoding, preserving
output parity. Experiments across diverse generation tasks shows that AdaDecode
consistently achieves superior decoding throughput with up to 1.73x speedup,
while guaranteeing output parity with standard autoregressive decoding.

Result: ScoreRAG 显著提高了生成新闻的准确性、连贯性、信息量和专业性，同时保持了生成过程的稳定性与一致性。

Conclusion: ScoreRAG 通过系统化方法有效改善了新闻生成的质量，并提供了代码和演示供进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: This research introduces ScoreRAG, an approach to enhance the quality of
automated news generation. Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing
and large language models, current news generation methods often struggle with
hallucinations, factual inconsistencies, and lack of domain-specific expertise
when producing news articles. ScoreRAG addresses these challenges through a
multi-stage framework combining retrieval-augmented generation, consistency
relevance evaluation, and structured summarization. The system first retrieves
relevant news documents from a vector database, maps them to complete news
items, and assigns consistency relevance scores based on large language model
evaluations. These documents are then reranked according to relevance, with
low-quality items filtered out. The framework proceeds to generate graded
summaries based on relevance scores, which guide the large language model in
producing complete news articles following professional journalistic standards.
Through this methodical approach, ScoreRAG aims to significantly improve the
accuracy, coherence, informativeness, and professionalism of generated news
articles while maintaining stability and consistency throughout the generation
process. The code and demo are available at:

Conclusion: 所提方法有效降低了流式语音识别的训练复杂度并提高了性能。

Abstract: Applying large pre-trained speech models like Whisper has shown promise in
reducing training costs for various speech tasks. However, integrating these
models into streaming systems remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel
prefix-to-prefix training framework for streaming recognition by fine-tuning
the Whisper. We introduce the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire mechanism to
establish a quasi-monotonic alignment between continuous speech sequences and
discrete text tokens. Additionally, we design Monotonic Finite Look-ahead
Attention, allowing each token to attend to infinite left-context and finite
right-context from the speech sequences. We also employ the wait-k decoding
strategy to simplify the decoding process while ensuring consistency between
training and testing. Our theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that
this approach achieves a controllable trade-off between latency and quality,
making it suitable for various streaming applications.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 用户在依赖模型的置信度估计时，模型的不确定性校准对安全部署至关重要。此前研究主要集中在分类器或短文本生成上，CoT推理的校准尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过监督微调仅使用标量置信度标签，无需推理监督或强化学习奖励；并提出了一种基于校准不确定性的重新思考方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在GSM8K、MATH-500和ARC-Challenge等任务中提升了校准性、准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 仅通过标量置信度标签的微调即可实现模型自我验证，同时改进推理路径与置信度的对齐。

Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is essential for the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs), particularly when users rely on verbalized confidence
estimates. While prior work has focused on classifiers or short-form
generation, confidence calibration for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning remains
largely unexplored. Surprisingly, we find that supervised fine-tuning with
scalar confidence labels alone suffices to elicit self-verification behavior of
language models, without any explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement
learning-based rewards. Despite being trained only to produce a verbalized
confidence score without any self-verifying examples, the model learns to
generate longer and self-checking responses for low-confidence queries while
providing more concise answers for high-confidence ones. We further propose a
simple rethinking method that boosts performance via test-time scaling based on
calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on GSM8K and held-out reasoning tasks such
as MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge show that our confidence-aware fine-tuning
improves both calibration and accuracy, while also enhancing interpretability
by aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence.

Result: 建立了1903张标注数据集，通过微调TTI模型提升了教育视觉生成能力，揭示了多模态教育内容生成中的挑战。

Conclusion: Math2Visual为自动化生成教育意义视觉内容设定了新基准，并提供了改进多模态教育内容的关键见解。

Abstract: Visuals are valuable tools for teaching math word problems (MWPs), helping
young learners interpret textual descriptions into mathematical expressions
before solving them. However, creating such visuals is labor-intensive and
there is a lack of automated methods to support this process. In this paper, we
present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically
meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a
pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math
teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs. Using
Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate
Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align
with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset,
demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation. Our work
establishes a new benchmark for automated generation of pedagogically
meaningful visuals and offers insights into key challenges in producing
multimodal educational content, such as the misrepresentation of mathematical
relationships and the omission of essential visual elements.

Conclusion: Pet-Bench是评估宠物伴侣相关LLM能力的基础资源，推动了情感沉浸式人宠互动的发展。

Abstract: As interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for interactive and
emotionally rich experiences grows, virtual pet companionship emerges as a
novel yet underexplored application. Existing approaches focus on basic pet
role-playing interactions without systematically benchmarking LLMs for
comprehensive companionship. In this paper, we introduce Pet-Bench, a dedicated
benchmark that evaluates LLMs across both self-interaction and
human-interaction dimensions. Unlike prior work, Pet-Bench emphasizes
self-evolution and developmental behaviors alongside interactive engagement,
offering a more realistic reflection of pet companionship. It features diverse
tasks such as intelligent scheduling, memory-based dialogues, and psychological
conversations, with over 7,500 interaction instances designed to simulate
complex pet behaviors. Evaluation of 28 LLMs reveals significant performance
variations linked to model size and inherent capabilities, underscoring the
need for specialized optimization in this domain. Pet-Bench serves as a
foundational resource for benchmarking pet-related LLM abilities and advancing
emotionally immersive human-pet interactions.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理过程需要大量资源，尤其是KV缓存占用过多内存。现有的基于注意力得分淘汰不必要令牌的方法存在偏差，导致模型无法充分利用全局上下文信息。

Method: AhaKV通过自适应调整softmax的比例，并利用值向量的信息来减少注意力得分的偏差，从而保留全局上下文中的关键令牌。

Result: 实验证明，AhaKV在固定缓存预算下有效减少了偏差，并在多个基准任务中取得了领先结果。

Conclusion: AhaKV通过自适应方法优化KV缓存，提升了大型语言模型的推理效率和全局上下文利用能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of
Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not
only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the
(Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several
works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these
approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify
the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is
biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical
expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial
positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address
this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the
bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of
softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores.
To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism,
AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous
works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is
well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a
fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and
retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art
results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.

Abstract: The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been enhanced by
training on data that reflects human thought processes, such as the
Chain-of-Thought format. However, evidence suggests that the conventional
scheme of next-word prediction may not fully capture how humans learn to think.
Inspired by how humans generalize mathematical reasoning, we propose a new
approach named ClozeMath to fine-tune LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our
ClozeMath involves a text-infilling task that predicts masked equations from a
given solution, analogous to cloze exercises used in human learning.
Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and GSM-Symbolic show that ClozeMath surpasses the
strong baseline Masked Thought in performance and robustness, with two
test-time scaling decoding algorithms, Beam Search and Chain-of-Thought
decoding. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of
various architectural and implementation choices on our approach.

Abstract: How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy?
Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs)
efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are
promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and
optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both
advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with
Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses
both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping
technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified
initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the
parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem
removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior
accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification.
Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ
methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.

Motivation: 当前 LLM 作为评估者通常依赖单个评估或单轮两两评估，缺乏全局排名视角，Knockout Assessment 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用淘汰赛系统进行迭代两两比较，改进 LLM 评估的准确性。

Result: 在三个 LLM 和两个数据集上的实验显示，Knockout Assessment 提高了评分准确性，Pearson 相关性平均提高 0.07。

Conclusion: Knockout Assessment 通过淘汰赛系统显著提升了 LLM 评估与人类评分的对齐程度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across
various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely mostly on individual assessments or a single
round of pairwise assessments, preventing the judge LLM from developing a
global ranking perspective. To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an
LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise
comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout
assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with
expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and
machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with
human scoring.

Conclusion: Cadence 展示了预训练语言模型在多语种标点恢复中的有效性，对低资源 NLP 管道具有实用价值。

Abstract: Punctuation plays a vital role in structuring meaning, yet current models
often struggle to restore it accurately in transcripts of spontaneous speech,
especially in the presence of disfluencies such as false starts and
backtracking. These limitations hinder the performance of downstream tasks like
translation, text to speech, summarization, etc. where sentence boundaries are
critical for preserving quality. In this work, we introduce Cadence, a
generalist punctuation restoration model adapted from a pretrained large
language model. Cadence is designed to handle both clean written text and
highly spontaneous spoken transcripts. It surpasses the previous state of the
art in performance while expanding support from 14 to all 22 Indian languages
and English. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of model behavior across
punctuation types and language families, identifying persistent challenges
under domain shift and with rare punctuation marks. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of utilizing pretrained language models for multilingual
punctuation restoration and highlight Cadence practical value for low resource
NLP pipelines at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 豪萨语文本中存在书写异常（如字符替换错误和空格错误），阻碍了NLP应用的发展。

Method: 通过合成噪声创建大规模平行数据集，微调多语言模型（如M2M100、AfriTEVA等），使用SentencePiece分词进行修正任务。

Result: 实验结果显示F1、BLEU和METEOR分数显著提升，字符错误率（CER）和词错误率（WER）明显降低。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一套健壮的方法、公开数据集和有效模型，提升了豪萨语文本质量，并为其他低资源语言提供了可迁移的见解。

Abstract: Hausa texts are often characterized by writing anomalies such as incorrect
character substitutions and spacing errors, which sometimes hinder natural
language processing (NLP) applications. This paper presents an approach to
automatically correct the anomalies by finetuning transformer-based models.
Using a corpus gathered from several public sources, we created a large-scale
parallel dataset of over 450,000 noisy-clean Hausa sentence pairs by
introducing synthetically generated noise, fine-tuned to mimic realistic
writing errors. Moreover, we adapted several multilingual and African
language-focused models, including M2M100, AfriTEVA, mBART, and Opus-MT
variants for this correction task using SentencePiece tokenization. Our
experimental results demonstrate significant increases in F1, BLEU and METEOR
scores, as well as reductions in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate
(WER). This research provides a robust methodology, a publicly available
dataset, and effective models to improve Hausa text quality, thereby advancing
NLP capabilities for the language and offering transferable insights for other
low-resource languages.

Key words: 查询重写,多目标优化,广告召回,电商搜索

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多目标对齐的竞价词生成模型（MoBGM），通过结合判别器、生成器和偏好对齐模块，解决了现有查询重写方法在相关性和真实性上的不足，同时最大化广告召回收益。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有查询重写方法难以同时优化用户查询的相关性、真实性和广告收益，影响了用户体验和搜索效率。

Method: 提出MoBGM模型，包含判别器、生成器和偏好对齐模块，利用判别器的反馈信号训练多目标对齐的生成器。

Result: 离线与在线实验表明，MoBGM显著优于现有技术，部署后为平台创造了巨大商业价值。

Conclusion: MoBGM在改进查询重写效果和广告收益方面表现出色，具有可行性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval systems primarily address the challenge of matching user queries
with the most relevant advertisements, playing a crucial role in e-commerce
search advertising. The diversity of user needs and expressions often produces
massive long-tail queries that cannot be matched with merchant bidwords or
product titles, which results in some advertisements not being recalled,
ultimately harming user experience and search efficiency. Existing query
rewriting research focuses on various methods such as query log mining,
query-bidword vector matching, or generation-based rewriting. However, these
methods often fail to simultaneously optimize the relevance and authenticity of
the user's original query and rewrite and maximize the revenue potential of
recalled ads.
  In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective aligned Bidword Generation Model
(MoBGM), which is composed of a discriminator, generator, and preference
alignment module, to address these challenges. To simultaneously improve the
relevance and authenticity of the query and rewrite and maximize the platform
revenue, we design a discriminator to optimize these key objectives. Using the
feedback signal of the discriminator, we train a multi-objective aligned
bidword generator that aims to maximize the combined effect of the three
objectives. Extensive offline and online experiments show that our proposed
algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art. After deployment, the
algorithm has created huge commercial value for the platform, further verifying
its feasibility and robustness.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨大脑调优的语音模型是否能更好地反映人类语音处理的中间阶段。

Method: 对大脑调优的语音模型进行逐层分析，评估其与大脑语义区域的匹配程度。

Result: 大脑调优模型的后期层在语义理解上显著优于预训练模型，且保持了从声学到语义的层级处理。

Conclusion: 大脑调优模型不仅性能更优，还能更好地模拟人类语音处理的层级结构，成为更优的研究工具。

Abstract: Pretrained self-supervised speech models excel in speech tasks but do not
reflect the hierarchy of human speech processing, as they encode rich semantics
in middle layers and poor semantics in late layers. Recent work showed that
brain-tuning (fine-tuning models using human brain recordings) improves speech
models' semantic understanding. Here, we examine how well brain-tuned models
further reflect the brain's intermediate stages of speech processing. We find
that late layers of brain-tuned models substantially improve over pretrained
models in their alignment with semantic language regions. Further layer-wise
probing reveals that early layers remain dedicated to low-level acoustic
features, while late layers become the best at complex high-level tasks. These
findings show that brain-tuned models not only perform better but also exhibit
a well-defined hierarchical processing going from acoustic to semantic
representations, making them better model organisms for human speech
processing.

Motivation: 探索社交媒体（如Reddit）在高频加密货币交易中的潜在价值，填补相关领域研究空白。

Method: 使用PulseReddit数据集，结合大型语言模型的多智能体系统，分析社交媒体情绪对高频交易的影响。

Result: 实验表明，结合PulseReddit数据的多智能体系统在牛市表现优异，且对不同市场环境具有强适应性。同时揭示了不同大型语言模型在性能与效率上的权衡。

Abstract: High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is pivotal in cryptocurrency markets, demanding
rapid decision-making. Social media platforms like Reddit offer valuable, yet
underexplored, information for such high-frequency, short-term trading. This
paper introduces \textbf{PulseReddit}, a novel dataset that is the first to
align large-scale Reddit discussion data with high-frequency cryptocurrency
market statistics for short-term trading analysis. We conduct an extensive
empirical study using Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems
(MAS) to investigate the impact of social sentiment from PulseReddit on trading
performance. Our experiments conclude that MAS augmented with PulseReddit data
achieve superior trading outcomes compared to traditional baselines,
particularly in bull markets, and demonstrate robust adaptability across
different market regimes. Furthermore, our research provides conclusive
insights into the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different LLMs,
detailing significant considerations for practical model selection in HFT
applications. PulseReddit and our findings establish a foundation for advanced
MAS research in HFT, demonstrating the tangible benefits of integrating social
media.

Key words: 大型语言模型, 性别偏见, 多语言评估, EuroGEST, 公平性, 刻板印象

TL;DR: EuroGEST是一个数据集，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在英语和29种欧洲语言中的性别刻板印象推理能力，揭示了模型对性别角色的刻板印象，并提出了多语言公平性研究的必要性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大多数性别偏见基准仅关注英语，缺乏对其他语言的研究，因此需要一种多语言的数据集来衡量LLMs中的性别刻板印象。

Method: 基于现有的专家评估基准，通过翻译工具、质量估计指标和形态启发式方法扩展，生成高精度的翻译和性别标签数据，并对24个多语言模型进行评估。

Result: 发现所有模型在所有语言中最强的性别刻板印象是女性“美丽、善解人意、整洁”而男性“领导者、强壮、专业”；更大的模型性别刻板印象更强，指令微调不能持续减少刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言公平性研究的必要性，并为跨语言性别偏见审计提供了可扩展的方法和资源。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly support multiple languages, yet most
benchmarks for gender bias remain English-centric. We introduce EuroGEST, a
dataset designed to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in LLMs across
English and 29 European languages. EuroGEST builds on an existing
expert-informed benchmark covering 16 gender stereotypes, expanded in this work
using translation tools, quality estimation metrics, and morphological
heuristics. Human evaluations confirm that our data generation method results
in high accuracy of both translations and gender labels across languages. We
use EuroGEST to evaluate 24 multilingual language models from six model
families, demonstrating that the strongest stereotypes in all models across all
languages are that women are \textit{beautiful,} \textit{empathetic} and
\textit{neat} and men are \textit{leaders}, \textit{strong, tough} and
\textit{professional}. We also show that larger models encode gendered
stereotypes more strongly and that instruction finetuning does not consistently
reduce gendered stereotypes. Our work highlights the need for more multilingual
studies of fairness in LLMs and offers scalable methods and resources to audit
gender bias across languages.

TL;DR: RadialRouter是一个创新的LLM路由框架，通过RadialFormer强化查询与LLM之间的联系，显著提升路由效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法因未充分探索查询与LLM特性之间的联系而效果受限，RadialRouter旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的轻量级RadialFormer结构，结合KL散度和查询对比损失的目标函数优化路由。

Result: 在RouterBench测试中，RadialRouter在两种场景下分别优于现有方法9.2%和5.8%，并展现出良好的适应性。

Conclusion: RadialRouter通过新型架构和目标函数实现了高效LLM路由，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the
emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal
LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance
while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness
due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user
queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper,
we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a
lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named
RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM
selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline
is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler
divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness.
Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly
outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost
First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different
performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical
application potential.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 印度有1369种语言，其中大多数缺乏高质量的数字资源，传统TTS系统难以全面覆盖。论文旨在解决这一挑战，为零资源语言提供语音合成解决方案。

Method: 通过增强共享音素表示和调整文本解析规则，使其适应目标语言的音位规则，从而降低合成器复杂度并实现快速适配。

Result: 成功为Sanskrit、Maharashtrian和Canara Konkani等语言生成了清晰自然的语音，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为零资源语言的语音合成提供了一种高效途径，扩展了语音技术的可及性。

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically require high-quality studio data and
accurate transcriptions for training. India has 1369 languages, with 22
official using 13 scripts. Training a TTS system for all these languages, most
of which have no digital resources, seems a Herculean task. Our work focuses on
zero-shot synthesis, particularly for languages whose scripts and phonotactics
come from different families. The novelty of our work is in the augmentation of
a shared phone representation and modifying the text parsing rules to match the
phonotactics of the target language, thus reducing the synthesiser overhead and
enabling rapid adaptation. Intelligible and natural speech was generated for
Sanskrit, Maharashtrian and Canara Konkani, Maithili and Kurukh by leveraging
linguistic connections across languages with suitable synthesisers. Evaluations
confirm the effectiveness of this approach, highlighting its potential to
expand speech technology access for under-represented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的LR(1)语法分析方法因其运行时执行开销大，尤其在批量推理时效率低下，因此需要一种更高效的结构化生成方法。

Method: 通过预处理预先计算前缀条件边，实现并行转换处理，并将LR(1)转换图转化为DPDA，避免运行时路径探索。

Result: 实验表明，Pre$^3$将每个输出令牌的时间（TPOT）减少了40%，吞吐量提高了36%。

Conclusion: Pre$^3$能无缝集成到现有LLM推理框架中，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Extensive LLM applications demand efficient structured generations,
particularly for LR(1) grammars, to produce outputs in specified formats (e.g.,
JSON). Existing methods primarily parse LR(1) grammars into a pushdown
automaton (PDA), leading to runtime execution overhead for context-dependent
token processing, especially inefficient under large inference batches. To
address these issues, we propose Pre$^3$ that exploits deterministic pushdown
automata (DPDA) to optimize the constrained LLM decoding efficiency. First, by
precomputing prefix-conditioned edges during the preprocessing, Pre$^3$ enables
ahead-of-time edge analysis and thus makes parallel transition processing
possible. Second, by leveraging the prefix-conditioned edges, Pre$^3$
introduces a novel approach that transforms LR(1) transition graphs into DPDA,
eliminating the need for runtime path exploration and achieving edge
transitions with minimal overhead. Pre$^3$ can be seamlessly integrated into
standard LLM inference frameworks, reducing time per output token (TPOT) by up
to 40% and increasing throughput by up to 36% in our experiments. Our code is

Motivation: 现有基准未能模拟真实检索环境中的复杂噪声分布，影响了RAG系统鲁棒性的可靠评估。

Method: 定义了四类检索噪声，构建Magic Mushroom基准，包含单跳和多跳问答对，支持噪声配置灵活调整。

Result: 实验表明生成器和去噪策略对噪声分布极为敏感，性能有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: Magic Mushroom是评估和提升噪声鲁棒性RAG系统的有效工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language Models
(LLMs) by incorporating external retrieved information, mitigating issues such
as hallucination and outdated knowledge.
  However, RAG systems are highly sensitive to retrieval noise prevalent in
real-world scenarios.
  Existing benchmarks fail to emulate the complex and heterogeneous noise
distributions encountered in real-world retrieval environments, undermining
reliable robustness assessment.
  In this paper, we define four categories of retrieval noise based on
linguistic properties and noise characteristics, aiming to reflect the
heterogeneity of noise in real-world scenarios.
  Building on this, we introduce Magic Mushroom, a benchmark for replicating
"magic mushroom" noise: contexts that appear relevant on the surface but
covertly mislead RAG systems.
  Magic Mushroom comprises 7,468 single-hop and 3,925 multi-hop question-answer
pairs.
  More importantly, Magic Mushroom enables researchers to flexibly configure
combinations of retrieval noise according to specific research objectives or
application scenarios, allowing for highly controlled evaluation setups.
  We evaluate LLM generators of varying parameter scales and classic RAG
denoising strategies under diverse noise distributions to investigate their
performance dynamics during progressive noise encroachment.
  Our analysis reveals that both generators and denoising strategies have
significant room for improvement and exhibit extreme sensitivity to noise
distributions.
  Magic Mushroom emerges as a promising tool for evaluating and advancing
noise-robust RAG systems, accelerating their widespread deployment in
real-world applications.

Motivation: 探索信息密度波动是否受周期性语言压力影响。

Method: 使用谐波回归和时间尺度扩展分析多语言文本。

Result: 发现信息率中存在周期性模式，与话语结构一致。

Conclusion: 信息密度的周期性反映了语言组织的深层结构。

Abstract: The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis proposes that speakers aim
to distribute information evenly throughout a text, balancing production effort
and listener comprehension difficulty. However, language typically does not
maintain a strictly uniform information rate; instead, it fluctuates around a
global average. These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as
syntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we
explore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced
by an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information
rate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies
simultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension
called time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information
contours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and
Brazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in
information rate. Many dominant frequencies align with discourse structure,
suggesting these oscillations reflect meaningful linguistic organization.
Beyond highlighting the connection between information rate and discourse
structure, our approach offers a general framework for uncovering structural
pressures at various levels of linguistic granularity.

Motivation: 随着机器学习在法律决策中的应用增加，如何有效评估公平性、一致性和偏见成为关键问题。特别是在难民裁决等高风险领域，现有方法是否能真正反映公平性尚不明确。

Method: 研究通过三种常见的机器学习方法（基于特征的分析、语义聚类和预测建模）对59,000多份加拿大难民判决数据（AsyLex）进行了实证分析。

Result: 结果表明，这些方法产生的结果存在分歧甚至矛盾；预测建模更依赖上下文和程序性特征而非法律特征；语义聚类未能捕捉实质性的法律推理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了统计方法在评估法律公平性中的局限性，认为当前的计机方法不足以评估法律自由裁量领域的公平性，必须结合法律推理和制度背景。

Abstract: Legal decisions are increasingly evaluated for fairness, consistency, and
bias using machine learning (ML) techniques. In high-stakes domains like
refugee adjudication, such methods are often applied to detect disparities in
outcomes. Yet it remains unclear whether statistical methods can meaningfully
assess fairness in legal contexts shaped by discretion, normative complexity,
and limited ground truth.
  In this paper, we empirically evaluate three common ML approaches
(feature-based analysis, semantic clustering, and predictive modeling) on a
large, real-world dataset of 59,000+ Canadian refugee decisions (AsyLex). Our
experiments show that these methods produce divergent and sometimes
contradictory signals, that predictive modeling often depends on contextual and
procedural features rather than legal features, and that semantic clustering
fails to capture substantive legal reasoning.
  We show limitations of statistical fairness evaluation, challenge the
assumption that statistical regularity equates to fairness, and argue that
current computational approaches fall short of evaluating fairness in legally
discretionary domains. We argue that evaluating fairness in law requires
methods grounded not only in data, but in legal reasoning and institutional
context.

Result: 在U-PLEAD和真实数据联合训练下，模型在组合泛化能力上表现优异，并在人源数据集PLEAD上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡数据集的训练，可以有效提升仇恨言论检测模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Hate speech detection is key to online content moderation, but current models
struggle to generalise beyond their training data. This has been linked to
dataset biases and the use of sentence-level labels, which fail to teach models
the underlying structure of hate speech. In this work, we show that even when
models are trained with more fine-grained, span-level annotations (e.g.,
"artists" is labeled as target and "are parasites" as dehumanising comparison),
they struggle to disentangle the meaning of these labels from the surrounding
context. As a result, combinations of expressions that deviate from those seen
during training remain particularly difficult for models to detect. We
investigate whether training on a dataset where expressions occur with equal
frequency across all contexts can improve generalisation. To this end, we
create U-PLEAD, a dataset of ~364,000 synthetic posts, along with a novel
compositional generalisation benchmark of ~8,000 manually validated posts.
Training on a combination of U-PLEAD and real data improves compositional
generalisation while achieving state-of-the-art performance on the
human-sourced PLEAD.

Method: 提出HSSBench基准，包含六种联合国官方语言的13,000多个样本，采用领域专家与自动化代理协作的数据生成流程。

Result: 超过20个主流MLLMs在HSSBench上表现不佳，表明其在跨学科推理和知识连接方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench为提升MLLMs的跨学科推理能力提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Result: 模型错误常与输入中的比较词汇一致；思维链提示可减少偏差，但其效果因形式而异；包含人口统计身份词汇会放大偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在语义框架下的推理盲区，强调需要设计更全面的评估基准以提高模型的鲁棒性和公平性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to be sensitive to input phrasing, but
the mechanisms by which semantic cues shape reasoning remain poorly understood.
We investigate this phenomenon in the context of comparative math problems with
objective ground truth, revealing a consistent and directional framing bias:
logically equivalent questions containing the words ``more'', ``less'', or
``equal'' systematically steer predictions in the direction of the framing
term. To study this effect, we introduce MathComp, a controlled benchmark of
300 comparison scenarios, each evaluated under 14 prompt variants across three
LLM families. We find that model errors frequently reflect linguistic steering,
systematic shifts toward the comparative term present in the prompt.
Chain-of-thought prompting reduces these biases, but its effectiveness varies:
free-form reasoning is more robust, while structured formats may preserve or
reintroduce directional drift. Finally, we show that including demographic
identity terms (e.g., ``a woman'', ``a Black person'') in input scenarios
amplifies directional drift, despite identical underlying quantities,
highlighting the interplay between semantic framing and social referents. These
findings expose critical blind spots in standard evaluation and motivate
framing-aware benchmarks for diagnosing reasoning robustness and fairness in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督计算方法，用于在对话中实时检测关键时刻，并通过危机咨询对话验证其有效性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 对话中的关键时刻对结果有重大影响，尤其是在心理危机咨询等高后果领域，因此需要一种检测这些时刻的方法。

Method: 基于无监督的计算方法，通过分析对话中下一步可能的回答对结果预期的影响来检测关键时刻。

Result: 验证显示，该方法与人类感知一致（咨询师在检测到的关键时刻反应时间更长），且关键时刻确实会影响对话的最终走向。此外，还探讨了咨询师在关键时刻的回应与会话结果的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别对话中的关键时刻，为高后果领域的对话辅助提供了工具。

Abstract: During a conversation, there can come certain moments where its outcome hangs
in the balance. In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the
conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly
different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could
assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such
as mental health crisis counseling.
  In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting
such pivotal moments as they happen, in an online fashion. Our approach relies
on the intuition that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the outcome
varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to
crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns
with human perception -- counselors take significantly longer to respond during
moments detected by our method -- and with the eventual conversational
trajectory -- which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use
our framework to explore the relation of the counselor's response during
pivotal moments with the eventual outcome of the session.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有TableQA基准测试局限于简单表格、数据泄露问题，且多为单语言，无法捕捉实际应用中的跨语言和跨领域多样性。

Method: TableEval包含多种结构的表格数据，涵盖四个领域和三种语言，同时提出SEAT评估框架，从子问题层面评估模型响应与参考答案的语义一致性。

Conclusion: TableEval为LLMs在复杂TableQA任务中的性能评估提供了更真实的基准，SEAT框架有效提升了语义准确性评估。

Abstract: LLMs have shown impressive progress in natural language processing. However,
they still face significant challenges in TableQA, where real-world
complexities such as diverse table structures, multilingual data, and
domain-specific reasoning are crucial. Existing TableQA benchmarks are often
limited by their focus on simple flat tables and suffer from data leakage.
Furthermore, most benchmarks are monolingual and fail to capture the
cross-lingual and cross-domain variability in practical applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce TableEval, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate LLMs on realistic TableQA tasks. Specifically, TableEval includes
tables with various structures (such as concise, hierarchical, and nested
tables) collected from four domains (including government, finance, academia,
and industry reports). Besides, TableEval features cross-lingual scenarios with
tables in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English. To minimize the
risk of data leakage, we collect all data from recent real-world documents.
Considering that existing TableQA metrics fail to capture semantic accuracy, we
further propose SEAT, a new evaluation framework that assesses the alignment
between model responses and reference answers at the sub-question level.
Experimental results have shown that SEAT achieves high agreement with human
judgment. Extensive experiments on TableEval reveal critical gaps in the
ability of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle these complex, real-world TableQA
tasks, offering insights for future improvements. We make our dataset available
here: https://github.com/wenge-research/TableEval.

Abstract: The pursuit of diverse, complex, and large-scale instruction data is crucial
for automatically aligning large language models (LLMs). While there are
methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either
suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or
rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in
terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment
are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use
cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed
grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a
selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up
synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation,
then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and
complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents.
Specifically, we construct a dataset of 1 million instructions, called
SynthQuestions, and demonstrate that models trained on it achieve leading
performance on several common benchmarks, with improvements that continually
scale with more web corpora. Data, models and codes will be available at
https://github.com/Ignoramus0817/SynthQuestions.

Result: 在MATH500和GSM8K数据集上显著优于传统最优-N和随机选择策略。

Conclusion: SPRINT框架通过动态剪枝优化推理性能，为模型剪枝提供了新方向。

Abstract: Model pruning in transformer-based language models, traditionally viewed as a
means of achieving computational savings, can enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities. In this work, we uncover a surprising phenomenon: the selective
pruning of certain attention heads leads to improvements in reasoning
performance, particularly on challenging tasks. Motivated by this observation,
we propose SPRINT, a novel contrastive learning framework that dynamically
selects the optimal head and layer to prune during inference. By aligning
question embeddings with head embeddings, SPRINT identifies those pruned-head
configurations that result in more accurate reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional best-of-$N$
and random head selection strategies on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets.

Result: 模型在一些情况下表现优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 预训练的多模态模型能有效提升轮流对话预测性能。

Abstract: Turn-taking management is crucial for any social interaction. Still, it is
challenging to model human-machine interaction due to the complexity of the
social context and its multimodal nature. Unlike conventional systems based on
silence duration, previous existing voice activity projection (VAP) models
successfully utilized a unified representation of turn-taking behaviors as
prediction targets, which improved turn-taking prediction performance.
Recently, a multimodal VAP model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art
model by a significant margin. In this paper, we propose a multimodal model
enhanced with pre-trained audio and face encoders to improve performance by
capturing subtle expressions. Our model performed competitively, and in some
cases, even better than state-of-the-art models on turn-taking metrics. All the
source codes and pretrained models are available at

Result: 模型在纯时间推理任务中表现良好，时空结合任务表现受限；表现与地名熟悉度正相关；提示格式显著影响性能。

Conclusion: 语言模型在时空联合推理中仍有局限，需优化训练数据和方法。

Abstract: Reasoning over time and space is essential for understanding our world.
However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored
as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of
time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In
this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models
to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create
GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37
time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three
different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic
knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving
only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale.
However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting
temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of
performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant
performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting
their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that
their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct
injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas,
surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance
on simpler tasks.

Motivation: 探究在长上下文语言模型（LMs）能力提升的背景下，多阶段RAG流程是否仍比单阶段方法有显著优势。

Method: 对QA任务进行控制性评估，比较两种多阶段RAG流程（ReadAgent和RAPTOR）与三种基线方法（包括简单的DOS RAG方法）。

Result: DOS RAG在多个长上下文QA基准测试中表现优于或与复杂方法相当。

Conclusion: 建议将DOS RAG作为未来RAG评估的简单有效基准，并与新兴嵌入和语言模型结合以评估复杂性与效果的权衡。

Abstract: With the rise of long-context language models (LMs) capable of processing
tens of thousands of tokens in a single pass, do multi-stage
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines still offer measurable benefits
over simpler, single-stage approaches? To assess this question, we conduct a
controlled evaluation for QA tasks under systematically scaled token budgets,
comparing two recent multi-stage pipelines, ReadAgent and RAPTOR, against three
baselines, including DOS RAG (Document's Original Structure RAG), a simple
retrieve-then-read method that preserves original passage order. Despite its
straightforward design, DOS RAG consistently matches or outperforms more
intricate methods on multiple long-context QA benchmarks. We recommend
establishing DOS RAG as a simple yet strong baseline for future RAG
evaluations, pairing it with emerging embedding and language models to assess
trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness as model capabilities evolve.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有视频建模方法导致视觉令牌数量庞大，尤其是长视频，亟需一种方法减少计算负担。

Method: DynTok将视觉令牌自适应分组并合并，高信息密度区域保留，低密度区域高压缩。

Result: 令牌数量减少至44.4%，性能相当，视频帧数增加时效果更好（Video-MME 65.3%，MLVU 72.5%）。

Conclusion: 揭示了视频令牌表示的冗余，为高效视频建模技术设计提供了启示。

Abstract: Typical video modeling methods, such as LLava, represent videos as sequences
of visual tokens, which are then processed by the LLM backbone for effective
video understanding. However, this approach leads to a massive number of visual
tokens, especially for long videos. A practical solution is to first extract
relevant visual information from the large visual context before feeding it
into the LLM backbone, thereby reducing computational overhead. In this work,
we introduce DynTok, a novel \textbf{Dyn}amic video \textbf{Tok}en compression
strategy. DynTok adaptively splits visual tokens into groups and merges them
within each group, achieving high compression in regions with low information
density while preserving essential content. Our method reduces the number of
tokens to 44.4% of the original size while maintaining comparable performance.
It further benefits from increasing the number of video frames and achieves
65.3% on Video-MME and 72.5% on MLVU. By applying this simple yet effective
compression method, we expose the redundancy in video token representations and
offer insights for designing more efficient video modeling techniques.

Method: 构建了“Words of Warmth”词库，分析了儿童学习相关词汇的速率，并通过案例研究展示了词库在偏见和刻板印象研究中的应用。

Result: 词库具有高可靠性，可用于研究偏见和刻板印象。

Conclusion: “Words of Warmth”支持多种社会心理学研究，尤其是关于偏见的分析。

Abstract: Social psychologists have shown that Warmth (W) and Competence (C) are the
primary dimensions along which we assess other people and groups. These
dimensions impact various aspects of our lives from social competence and
emotion regulation to success in the work place and how we view the world. More
recent work has started to explore how these dimensions develop, why they have
developed, and what they constitute. Of particular note, is the finding that
warmth has two distinct components: Trust (T) and Sociability (S). In this
work, we introduce Words of Warmth, the first large-scale repository of
manually derived word--warmth (as well as word--trust and word--sociability)
associations for over 26k English words. We show that the associations are
highly reliable. We use the lexicons to study the rate at which children
acquire WCTS words with age. Finally, we show that the lexicon enables a wide
variety of bias and stereotype research through case studies on various target
entities. Words of Warmth is freely available at:

Conclusion: 结果揭示了单模态学习的潜力及多模态互补性。

Abstract: Human learning and conceptual representation is grounded in sensorimotor
experience, in contrast to state-of-the-art foundation models. In this paper,
we investigate how well such large-scale models, trained on vast quantities of
data, represent the semantic feature norms of concrete object concepts, e.g. a
ROSE is red, smells sweet, and is a flower. More specifically, we use probing
tasks to test which properties of objects these models are aware of. We
evaluate image encoders trained on image data alone, as well as
multimodally-trained image encoders and language-only models, on predicting an
extended denser version of the classic McRae norms and the newer Binder dataset
of attribute ratings. We find that multimodal image encoders slightly
outperform language-only approaches, and that image-only encoders perform
comparably to the language models, even on non-visual attributes that are
classified as "encyclopedic" or "function". These results offer new insights
into what can be learned from pure unimodal learning, and the complementarity
of the modalities.

Conclusion: QQSUM-RAG能够有效捕捉多样性用户观点，提升问答系统性能。

Abstract: Review-based Product Question Answering (PQA) allows e-commerce platforms to
automatically address customer queries by leveraging insights from user
reviews. However, existing PQA systems generate answers with only a single
perspective, failing to capture the diversity of customer opinions. In this
paper we introduce a novel task Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization
(QQSUM), which aims to summarize diverse customer opinions into representative
Key Points (KPs) and quantify their prevalence to effectively answer user
queries. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for PQA, its
generated answers still fall short of capturing the full diversity of
viewpoints. To tackle this challenge, our model QQSUM-RAG, which extends RAG,
employs few-shot learning to jointly train a KP-oriented retriever and a KP
summary generator, enabling KP-based summaries that capture diverse and
representative opinions. Experimental results demonstrate that QQSUM-RAG
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art RAG baselines in
both textual quality and quantification accuracy of opinions. Our source code

Abstract: Background: We present a Patient Simulator that leverages real world patient
encounters which cover a broad range of conditions and symptoms to provide
synthetic test subjects for development and testing of healthcare agentic
models. The simulator provides a realistic approach to patient presentation and
multi-turn conversation with a symptom-checking agent. Objectives: (1) To
construct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health
agent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the
validity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient
Simulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation
framework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven
simulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system.
Methods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient
vignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of
presenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance
of the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across
over 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AI agent to
provide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The
resulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians.
Results: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient
vignettes in those same 97.7% of cases. The extracted case summary based on the
conversation history was 99% relevant. Conclusions: We developed a methodology
to incorporate vignettes derived from real healthcare patient data to build a
simulation of patient responses to symptom checking agents. The performance and
alignment of this Patient Simulator could be used to train and test a
multi-turn conversational AI agent at scale.

Method: 使用英语、法语和荷兰语的双语VGS模型进行训练，分析其ME偏置表现。

Result: 双语模型的ME偏置通常较弱，部分原因是其视觉嵌入在熟悉数据上的方差较小，导致新概念和熟悉概念的混淆增加。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了双语模型ME偏置减弱的原因，并为VGS模型中ME偏置的存在提供了新的解释。

Abstract: Mutual exclusivity (ME) is a strategy where a novel word is associated with a
novel object rather than a familiar one, facilitating language learning in
children. Recent work has found an ME bias in a visually grounded speech (VGS)
model trained on English speech with paired images. But ME has also been
studied in bilingual children, who may employ it less due to cross-lingual
ambiguity. We explore this pattern computationally using bilingual VGS models
trained on combinations of English, French, and Dutch. We find that bilingual
models generally exhibit a weaker ME bias than monolingual models, though
exceptions exist. Analyses show that the combined visual embeddings of
bilingual models have a smaller variance for familiar data, partly explaining
the increase in confusion between novel and familiar concepts. We also provide
new insights into why the ME bias exists in VGS models in the first place. Code

Abstract: Temporal reasoning in legal texts is important for applications like case law
analysis and compliance monitoring. However, existing datasets lack expert
language evaluation, leaving a gap in understanding how LLMs manage event
ordering in legal contexts. We introduce LexTime, the first dataset designed to
evaluate LLMs' event ordering capabilities in legal language, consisting of 512
instances from U.S. Federal Complaints with annotated event pairs and their
temporal relations. Our findings show that (1) LLMs are more accurate on legal
event ordering than on narrative (up to +10.5%); (2) longer input contexts and
implicit events boost accuracy, reaching 80.8% for implicit-explicit event
pairs; (3) legal linguistic complexities and nested clauses remain a challenge.
We investigate how context length, explicit vs implicit event pairs, and legal
language features affect model performance, demonstrating the need for specific
modeling strategies to enhance temporal event reasoning.

Motivation: 当前的定位-编辑方法在修改目标知识时容易影响无关知识，其根本原因是优化过程中的主体特征过学习问题。

Method: 通过两阶段优化过程，平衡主体特征和关系特征的学习，避免主体特征的过学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法成功避免了知识编辑的捷径学习问题，实现了最佳的整体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段优化方法有效提升了知识编辑的可控性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to alternate the target knowledge predicted by large
language models while ensuring the least side effects on unrelated knowledge.
An effective way to achieve knowledge editing is to identify pivotal parameters
for predicting factual associations and modify them with an optimization
process to update the predictions. However, these locate-then-edit methods are
uncontrollable since they tend to modify most unrelated relations connected to
the subject of target editing. We unveil that this failure of controllable
editing is due to a shortcut learning issue during the optimization process.
Specifically, we discover two crucial features that are the subject feature and
the relation feature for models to learn during optimization, but the current
optimization process tends to over-learning the subject feature while
neglecting the relation feature. To eliminate this shortcut learning of the
subject feature, we propose a novel two-stage optimization process that
balances the learning of the subject feature and the relation feature.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully prevents
knowledge editing from shortcut learning and achieves the optimal overall
performance, contributing to controllable knowledge editing.

Key words: 自动化反仇恨言论,LLM,可访问性,伦理风险,情感语调

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估LLM生成反仇恨言论（CN）的框架，涉及四个维度，并测试了三种提示策略，发现CN常冗长且适应高等教育水平人群，同时情感引导提示虽提升可读性，但安全和有效性存疑。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究旨在解决自动化反仇恨言论在情感语调、可访问性和伦理风险方面的挑战，以优化其效果。

Method: 使用GPT-4o-Mini等三种LLM及MT-Conan和HatEval数据集，评估四种维度（如人格框架、可读性）和三种提示策略。

Result: LLM生成的CN往往冗长且面向高学历人群，情感提示虽提升共情和可读性，但安全和有效性仍需关注。

Conclusion: 自动化反仇恨言论需改进可访问性和伦理安全性，情感引导提示是潜在优化方向。

Abstract: Automated counter-narratives (CN) offer a promising strategy for mitigating
online hate speech, yet concerns about their affective tone, accessibility, and
ethical risks remain. We propose a framework for evaluating Large Language
Model (LLM)-generated CNs across four dimensions: persona framing, verbosity
and readability, affective tone, and ethical robustness. Using GPT-4o-Mini,
Cohere's CommandR-7B, and Meta's LLaMA 3.1-70B, we assess three prompting
strategies on the MT-Conan and HatEval datasets. Our findings reveal that
LLM-generated CNs are often verbose and adapted for people with college-level
literacy, limiting their accessibility. While emotionally guided prompts yield
more empathetic and readable responses, there remain concerns surrounding
safety and effectiveness.

algorithm to solve the task of unlearning - removing specific knowledge from a
large language model without retraining from scratch and compromising its
overall utility (SemEval-2025 Task 4: Unlearning sensitive content from Large

to remove the influence of the data from the model and \textit{second-order
optimization} to stabilize the overall utility. Our experiments show that this
lightweight approach is well applicable for unlearning LLMs in different kinds
of task.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 语言模型虽然能完成复杂任务，但其决策原因难以理解，因此研究数据为中心的可解释性成为关键。

Method: 利用表示定理分析支持样本（支持或阻止特定预测的样本），并研究非支持样本的作用。

Result: 发现支持样本的性质是内在的，而非支持样本在防止过拟合和中间表示形成中至关重要，尤其在深层网络中作用更显著。

Conclusion: 研究为理解语言模型行为和数据与模型决策的互动提供了新维度。

Abstract: Language models excel in various tasks by making complex decisions, yet
understanding the rationale behind these decisions remains a challenge. This
paper investigates \emph{data-centric interpretability} in language models,
focusing on the next-word prediction task. Using representer theorem, we
identify two types of \emph{support samples}-those that either promote or deter
specific predictions. Our findings reveal that being a support sample is an
intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally,
while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play
a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and
representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples
increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate
representation formation.These insights shed light on the interplay between
data and model decisions, offering a new dimension to understanding language
model behavior and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨如何通过XAI方法减少AI生成文本的可检测性，同时开发更稳健的检测方法。

Method: 使用SHAP和LIME识别对分类器预测影响最大的令牌，提出四种基于解释性的令牌替换策略，并训练集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 令牌替换策略能显著降低单一分类器对AI生成文本的检测能力，但集成分类器在多语言和领域下表现稳健。

Conclusion: XAI方法能有效隐藏AI生成文本，但需要多模型检测策略应对令牌级干扰。

Abstract: Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown
remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they
often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text
written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI)
methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT)
while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by
training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text,
then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its
predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies
to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token
replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability
to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance
across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can
mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI
methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential
tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based
detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决LLMs因缺乏知识或能力而产生错误答案（幻觉）的问题，通过后训练使其在不确定时选择回避。

Method: 提出HALT方法，通过拆分预训练LLM的回答为事实片段，利用真实信息识别并修正错误片段，调整阈值以实现正确性与完整性的平衡。

Result: 在传记、数学、编程和医学领域，HALT平均提高了15%的片段正确性，F1分数提升4%，最高正确性可达87%。

Conclusion: HALT有效减少了LLMs的幻觉问题，实现了高正确性与适度完整性的结合，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they
can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a
problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to
generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise
(partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces
capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and
cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the
pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps),
and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve
capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments
or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold
that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean
correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models
for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three
different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response
completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response
fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1
score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the
relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single
reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all
four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with
standard finetuning.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中表现优异，但训练后的样本利用效率低且难以灵活处理难度样本，限制了其性能提升。

Method: 提出了定制化课程学习（CCL）框架，包含两个创新：模型自适应难度定义和动态提示技术（Guided Prompting）。

Result: 在监督微调和强化学习的实验中，CCL在五个数学推理基准测试中显著优于统一训练方法，提高了样本利用率和模型性能。

Conclusion: CCL框架能有效提升大型语言模型的样本利用率和性能，适用于多种训练范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
various reasoning tasks, yet post-training is constrained by inefficient sample
utilization and inflexible difficulty samples processing. To address these
limitations, we propose Customized Curriculum Learning (CCL), a novel framework
with two key innovations. First, we introduce model-adaptive difficulty
definition that customizes curriculum datasets based on each model's individual
capabilities rather than using predefined difficulty metrics. Second, we
develop "Guided Prompting," which dynamically reduces sample difficulty through
strategic hints, enabling effective utilization of challenging samples that
would otherwise degrade performance. Comprehensive experiments on supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning demonstrate that CCL significantly
outperforms uniform training approaches across five mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness across both paradigms in enhancing
sample utilization and model performance.

Motivation: 视障人士的导航指令生成（NIG-VI）是一个重要但研究不足的领域，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 提出LaF-GRPO框架，利用LLM模拟视障用户响应生成奖励信号，指导VLM后训练。

Result: 实验表明，LaF-GRPO在BLEU和METEOR指标上显著优于基线（如+14%），生成的指令更直观、安全。

Conclusion: LaF-GRPO结合NIG4VI数据集为视障人士导航指令生成提供了高效且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals
(NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study, hence, focuses
on producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are
practically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO
(LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate
rewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances
instruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To
facilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced
benchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial
coordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation.
Experiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative
metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542
vs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions. Code and

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统语言学习方式与LLM生成文本的高复杂性不匹配，尤其对初学者不利。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用无需调优的模块化可控生成技术（如未来鉴别器），并通过自动指标和用户研究（日语学习者）进行评估。

Result: 未来鉴别器显著提升输出可理解性（40.4%至84.3%），并提出新指标TMR量化不可理解词汇比例。

Conclusion: 可控生成技术能有效适配初学者需求，为AI辅助语言学习提供新工具与数据支持。

Abstract: Practicing conversations with large language models (LLMs) presents a
promising alternative to traditional in-person language learning. However, most
LLMs generate text at a near-native level of complexity, making them ill-suited
for beginner learners (CEFR: A1-A2). In this paper, we investigate whether
controllable generation techniques -- specifically modular methods that do not
require model fine-tuning -- can adapt LLM outputs to better support absolute
beginners. We evaluate these methods through both automatic metrics and a user
study with university-level learners of Japanese. Our findings show that while
prompting alone fails to control output difficulty, the use of future
discriminators (Yang and Klein, 2021) significantly improves output
comprehensibility (from 40.4\% to 84.3\%). We further introduce a novel
token-level evaluation metric, Token Miss Rate (TMR), that quantifies the
proportion of incomprehensible tokens per utterance and correlates strongly
with human judgments. To support future research in AI-assisted language
learning, we release our code, models, annotation tools, and dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 自动语音评估需要准确捕捉不流畅现象，但现有ASR系统通常忽略或泛化犹豫现象，导致重要声学细节丢失。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调Whisper模型，比较三种标注方案：去除犹豫（Pure）、通用标签（Rich）和声学精确填充（Extra）。

Result: 最佳方案（Extra）使WER降低至5.5%，较Pure方案提升了11.3%。

Conclusion: 显式且真实的填充停顿标注能显著提升L2语音转录的ASR准确性。

Abstract: Verbatim transcription for automatic speaking assessment demands accurate
capture of disfluencies, crucial for downstream tasks like error analysis and
feedback. However, many ASR systems discard or generalize hesitations, losing
important acoustic details. We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak & Improve
2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external
audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations
(Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by
Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge
system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge
experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the "Extra"
scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the "Pure" scheme
(6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling
significantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription.

Result: 在LTTC数据集上优于依赖真实数据或传统增强的方法，有效缓解低资源限制。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将跨模态信息整合到口语评估中，提升了性能。

Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered
by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and
undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate
diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into
synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a
dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on
feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech.
Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual
features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly.
Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms
methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively
mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions
with cross-modal information.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because
medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current
medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive
medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have
limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often
not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor
assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present
LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996
questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed
clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline,
incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework.
Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine
agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert
feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories
(specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on
LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment
of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in

Result: 语言代理与人类玩家在长时程规划任务中存在显著性能差距，揭示了在顺序推理、状态跟踪和战略规划方面的挑战。

Conclusion: TextAtari为语言模型与规划研究的结合提供了标准化评测工具和基准框架。

Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very
long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating
the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual
descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential
decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly
100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning
horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning
framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models
(Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks
(zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how
different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon
challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and
Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction
comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players
in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning,
state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps.
TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations,
and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models

Result: 实验表明，ReSA在数学推理、语言建模和检索任务中实现了近乎无损的生成质量，显著提升了效率，在256K序列长度下实现了最高2.42倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: ReSA是一种实用且可扩展的长上下文推理解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient long-sequence generation is a critical challenge for Large Language
Models. While recent sparse decoding methods improve efficiency, they suffer
from KV cache misalignment, where approximation errors accumulate and degrade
generation quality. In this work, we propose Rectified Sparse Attention (ReSA),
a simple yet effective method that combines block-sparse attention with
periodic dense rectification. By refreshing the KV cache at fixed intervals
using a dense forward pass, ReSA bounds error accumulation and preserves
alignment with the pretraining distribution. Experiments across math reasoning,
language modeling, and retrieval tasks demonstrate that ReSA achieves
near-lossless generation quality with significantly improved efficiency.
Notably, ReSA delivers up to 2.42$\times$ end-to-end speedup under decoding at
256K sequence length, making it a practical solution for scalable long-context
inference. Code is available at https://aka.ms/ReSA-LM.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究发现法庭对话中的操控行为会影响判决，目前NLP在该领域的应用较少，需填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了标注数据集LegalCon，并提出两阶段多智能体框架CLAIM，通过上下文感知增强操控分析。

Result: 结果表明，基于智能体的框架能有效提升操控分析的公平性和透明度。

Conclusion: 该研究为NLP在法律领域的应用提供了新方向，支持司法决策的公平性。

Abstract: Courtrooms are places where lives are determined and fates are sealed, yet
they are not impervious to manipulation. Strategic use of manipulation in legal
jargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the
growing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing
manipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work
addresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated
courtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of
primary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a
focus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage,
Intent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis
by enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight
the potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and
transparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the
broader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of
robust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Disha1001/CLAIM.

*Ratna Kandala,Katie Hoemann*

Key words: LLM, 情感效价, 弗拉芒语, 计算语言学, LIWC, Pattern

TL;DR: LLM在捕获弗拉芒语日常叙述中的情感效价上表现不如传统工具LIWC和Pattern，需开发更贴合文化和语言的模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探索LLM在自然语境下情感效价分析的潜力，弥补传统工具在自发性和文化适应性上的不足。

Method: 对102名荷兰语参与者收集约25,000条自发叙述，结合连续效价评分，比较三种荷兰语LLM与LIWC、Pattern的预测效果。

Result: 当前荷兰语LLM在情感效价预测上不如传统工具，需进一步优化模型与文化适配性。

Conclusion: 需更多资源和努力，优化低资源语言（如弗拉芒语）的LLM，以支持计算语言学和情感研究的结合。

Abstract: Understanding the nuances in everyday language is pivotal for advancements in
computational linguistics & emotions research. Traditional lexicon-based tools
such as LIWC and Pattern have long served as foundational instruments in this
domain. LIWC is the most extensively validated word count based text analysis
tool in the social sciences and Pattern is an open source Python library
offering functionalities for NLP. However, everyday language is inherently
spontaneous, richly expressive, & deeply context dependent. To explore the
capabilities of LLMs in capturing the valences of daily narratives in Flemish,
we first conducted a study involving approximately 25,000 textual responses
from 102 Dutch-speaking participants. Each participant provided narratives
prompted by the question, "What is happening right now and how do you feel
about it?", accompanied by self-assessed valence ratings on a continuous scale
from -50 to +50. We then assessed the performance of three Dutch-specific LLMs
in predicting these valence scores, and compared their outputs to those
generated by LIWC and Pattern. Our findings indicate that, despite advancements
in LLM architectures, these Dutch tuned models currently fall short in
accurately capturing the emotional valence present in spontaneous, real-world
narratives. This study underscores the imperative for developing culturally and
linguistically tailored models/tools that can adeptly handle the complexities
of natural language use. Enhancing automated valence analysis is not only
pivotal for advancing computational methodologies but also holds significant
promise for psychological research with ecologically valid insights into human
daily experiences. We advocate for increased efforts in creating comprehensive
datasets & finetuning LLMs for low-resource languages like Flemish, aiming to
bridge the gap between computational linguistics & emotion research.

Key words: 大语言模型、数据污染、捷径神经元、可信评估、泛化性

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过分析模型内部机制解决数据污染问题的新方法，通过识别和抑制‘捷径神经元’来提升模型评估的可信度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的评估依赖公开基准，但数据污染问题严重影响了公平性。构建动态基准成本高且周期性长，因此需要从模型内部机制入手解决污染问题。

Method: 通过比较和因果分析识别‘捷径神经元’，并提出‘捷径神经元修补’方法抑制这些神经元。实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Result: 方法显著降低了污染影响，评估结果与可信基准MixEval的Spearman系数超过0.95，表明方法可靠且揭示模型真实能力。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种解决数据污染的新途径，通过内部神经元分析提升评估的可信度和泛化能力。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) depends on trustworthy
evaluation. However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which
are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness.
Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address
contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and
cyclical. In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the
mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we
discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to
parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel
method for identifying shortcut neurons through comparative and causal
analysis. Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called shortcut
neuron patching to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the
effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our
evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently
released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient ($\rho$)
exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals
true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy. We conduct further
experiments to demonstrate the generalizability of our method across various
benchmarks and hyperparameter settings. Code:

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ArchEHR-QA数据集，用于评估AI在电子健康记录(EHR)问答中的表现，并测试了不同LLM模型的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决患者对住院信息的需求，并评估AI生成的回答的事实准确性和相关性。

Method: 利用专家标注的EHR数据集，测试三种LLM模型在三种提示策略下的表现。

Result: Llama 4在'回答优先'提示策略中表现最佳，但仍存在遗漏关键证据或虚构内容的问题。

Conclusion: ArchEHR-QA为患者为中心的EHR QA系统提供了基准，但需要进一步改进事实性和相关性。

Abstract: Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can
be addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs).
While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs,
robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of
AI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient
information needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an
expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care
unit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by
patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant
clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and
clinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question
answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models
(LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies:
generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers
before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed
performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences
and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system
and reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The
answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4
achieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings
and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and
contradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong
benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems,
underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and
relevant responses in clinical contexts.

Key words: 大型语言模型, 动态剪枝, 资源优化, SkipGPT

TL;DR: SkipGPT是一种动态层剪枝框架，通过全局令牌感知路由和分离的MLP与自注意力剪枝策略，减少40%以上参数同时保持性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）计算成本高，传统静态剪枝方法忽略了令牌和组件间的动态差异，需要更高效的动态剪枝策略。

Method: SkipGPT引入全局令牌感知路由和MLP/自注意力分离剪枝策略，采用两阶段优化（解耦训练和LoRA微调）以减少训练不稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，SkipGPT在减少40%以上参数的同时，性能与原密集模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: SkipGPT通过动态剪枝与表达力保留，推动了资源高效LLMs的实际应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across tasks but
incur substantial computational costs due to their deep, multi-layered
architectures. Layer pruning has emerged as a strategy to alleviate these
inefficiencies, but conventional static pruning methods overlook two critical
dynamics inherent to LLM inference: (1) horizontal dynamics, where token-level
heterogeneity demands context-aware pruning decisions, and (2) vertical
dynamics, where the distinct functional roles of MLP and self-attention layers
necessitate component-specific pruning policies. We introduce SkipGPT, a
dynamic layer pruning framework designed to optimize computational resource
allocation through two core innovations: (1) global token-aware routing to
prioritize critical tokens, and (2) decoupled pruning policies for MLP and
self-attention components. To mitigate training instability, we propose a
two-stage optimization paradigm: first, a disentangled training phase that
learns routing strategies via soft parameterization to avoid premature pruning
decisions, followed by parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning to restore
performance impacted by layer removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SkipGPT reduces over 40% of model parameters while matching or exceeding the
performance of the original dense model across benchmarks. By harmonizing
dynamic efficiency with preserved expressivity, SkipGPT advances the practical
deployment of scalable, resource-aware LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成长文本时面临的连贯性、逻辑一致性和文本质量随长度下降的问题。

Method: 提出SuperWriter-Agent框架，包括结构化思维、规划和精炼阶段，并使用分层直接偏好优化（DPO）和蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）进行优化。

Result: SuperWriter-LM在多种基准测试中表现优异，超越了更大规模的基线模型，并通过消融实验验证了分层DPO和结构化思维步骤的有效性。

Conclusion: 结构化思维步骤和分层DPO显著提升了长文本生成的质量，为未来研究提供了有价值的思路。

Abstract: Long-form text generation remains a significant challenge for large language
models (LLMs), particularly in maintaining coherence, ensuring logical
consistency, and preserving text quality as sequence length increases. To
address these limitations, we propose SuperWriter-Agent, an agent-based
framework designed to enhance the quality and consistency of long-form text
generation. SuperWriter-Agent introduces explicit structured thinking-through
planning and refinement stages into the generation pipeline, guiding the model
to follow a more deliberate and cognitively grounded process akin to that of a
professional writer. Based on this framework, we construct a supervised
fine-tuning dataset to train a 7B SuperWriter-LM. We further develop a
hierarchical Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) procedure that uses Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to propagate final quality assessments and optimize
each generation step accordingly. Empirical results across diverse benchmarks
demonstrate that SuperWriter-LM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing even larger-scale baseline models in both automatic evaluation and
human evaluation. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of hierarchical DPO and underscore the value of incorporating
structured thinking steps to improve the quality of long-form text generation.

TL;DR: 论文通过对比长链和短链思维（CoT）提示策略的性能与资源消耗，提出了动态选择策略的SwitchCoT框架，在保持高准确性的同时显著降低计算成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着大型推理模型的快速发展，长链思维（CoT）提示在复杂任务中表现出色，但会显著增加token消耗。研究旨在探索如何平衡性能与计算效率。

Method: 通过实证分析比较长短CoT策略，提出SwitchCoT框架，根据任务上下文和资源动态选择策略。

Result: SwitchCoT在有限资源下可减少50%推理成本，同时保持或超越单一策略的性能。

Conclusion: 动态选择CoT策略能有效平衡准确性与效率，尤其适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large reasoning models, long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting has demonstrated strong performance on complex tasks. However,
this often comes with a significant increase in token usage. In this paper, we
conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis comparing long and short CoT
strategies. Our findings reveal that while long CoT can lead to performance
improvements, its benefits are often marginal relative to its significantly
higher token consumption. Specifically, long CoT tends to outperform when ample
generation budgets are available, whereas short CoT is more effective under
tighter budget constraints. These insights underscore the need for a dynamic
approach that selects the proper CoT strategy based on task context and
resource availability. To address this, we propose SwitchCoT, an automatic
framework that adaptively chooses between long and short CoT strategies to
balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, SwitchCoT is
designed to be budget-aware, making it broadly applicable across scenarios with
varying resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchCoT
can reduce inference costs by up to 50% while maintaining high accuracy.
Notably, under limited token budgets, it achieves performance comparable to, or
even exceeding, that of using either long or short CoT alone.

Key words: 大型语言模型、强化学习、多步推理、搜索交互、R-Search

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为R-Search的新型强化学习框架，旨在通过多奖励信号优化大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理-搜索交互轨迹，提升复杂逻辑和知识密集型任务中的响应质量。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在多步和长链推理方面取得了显著进展，但在与搜索的深度交互中仍难以找到最优的交互轨迹，导致响应质量不佳。

Method: R-Search框架通过强化学习，引导LLM动态决定何时检索或推理，并通过多阶段、多类型的奖励联合优化推理-搜索轨迹。

Result: 在七个数据集上的实验表明，R-Search在领域内和领域外的性能分别比先进的RAG基线提升了32.2%和25.1%。

Conclusion: R-Search有效增强了LLM在复杂任务中的推理和搜索交互能力，显著提升了响应质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have notably progressed in multi-step and
long-chain reasoning. However, extending their reasoning capabilities to
encompass deep interactions with search remains a non-trivial challenge, as
models often fail to identify optimal reasoning-search interaction
trajectories, resulting in suboptimal responses. We propose R-Search, a novel
reinforcement learning framework for Reasoning-Search integration, designed to
enable LLMs to autonomously execute multi-step reasoning with deep search
interaction, and learn optimal reasoning search interaction trajectories via
multi-reward signals, improving response quality in complex logic- and
knowledge-intensive tasks. R-Search guides the LLM to dynamically decide when
to retrieve or reason, while globally integrating key evidence to enhance deep
knowledge interaction between reasoning and search. During RL training,
R-Search provides multi-stage, multi-type rewards to jointly optimize the
reasoning-search trajectory. Experiments on seven datasets show that R-Search
outperforms advanced RAG baselines by up to 32.2% (in-domain) and 25.1%
(out-of-domain). The code and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种减少知识编辑方法（如MEMIT）中预计算隐藏向量数量的方法，显著降低了计算成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统知识编辑方法需要预计算大量隐藏向量，耗时且计算成本高，本文旨在减少这一成本。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，证明仅需预计算极少部分隐藏向量即可完成知识编辑。

Result: 实验表明，预计算可减少至原数量的0.3%，显著节省时间。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了知识编辑的效率，使新模型的编辑任务能在几分钟内启动。

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute
efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update
facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a
"precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational
cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million
hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million
tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single
GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this
precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this
excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and
related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a
very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the
theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for
solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that
knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing
significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the
precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally
stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of
precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few
minutes.

Key words: 扩散强化学习, 离线强化学习, 模块化训练, 指导模块, 可转移性

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种模块化训练方法，将指导模块与扩散模型解耦，提升了离线强化学习的效率和性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有的扩散强化学习方法依赖于联合训练指导模块和扩散模型，早期阶段指导不准确时会提供噪声学习信号。离线RL中指导仅依赖于离线数据，表明联合训练非必需。

Method: 1. 探索指导的必要性；2. 提出指导优先的扩散训练方法；3. 实现跨模块可转移性，独立训练的指导模块可直接复用。

Result: 模块化方法减少内存使用、提升计算效率和样本效率，跨模块转移性显著降低分数方差（如IQR减少86%）。

Conclusion: 研究为离线RL提供了模块化、可重用和可组合的训练流程新范式。

Abstract: Classifier free guidance has shown strong potential in diffusion-based
reinforcement learning. However, existing methods rely on joint training of the
guidance module and the diffusion model, which can be suboptimal during the
early stages when the guidance is inaccurate and provides noisy learning
signals. In offline RL, guidance depends solely on offline data: observations,
actions, and rewards, and is independent of the policy module's behavior,
suggesting that joint training is not required. This paper proposes modular
training methods that decouple the guidance module from the diffusion model,
based on three key findings:
  Guidance Necessity: We explore how the effectiveness of guidance varies with
the training stage and algorithm choice, uncovering the roles of guidance and
diffusion. A lack of good guidance in the early stage presents an opportunity
for optimization.
  Guidance-First Diffusion Training: We introduce a method where the guidance
module is first trained independently as a value estimator, then frozen to
guide the diffusion model using classifier-free reward guidance. This
modularization reduces memory usage, improves computational efficiency, and
enhances both sample efficiency and final performance.
  Cross-Module Transferability: Applying two independently trained guidance
models, one during training and the other during inference, can significantly
reduce normalized score variance (e.g., reducing IQR by 86%). We show that
guidance modules trained with one algorithm (e.g., IDQL) can be directly reused
with another (e.g., DQL), with no additional training required, demonstrating
baseline-level performance as well as strong modularity and transferability.
  We provide theoretical justification and empirical validation on bullet D4RL
benchmarks. Our findings suggest a new paradigm for offline RL: modular,
reusable, and composable training pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现实世界问题的复杂性需要融合多模态数据，但单一域的数据不足以解决问题，因此需要跨域知识融合。现有研究假设多模态数据在单一域内对齐，这在跨域场景可能不适用。

Method: 提出四层框架（Domains、Links、Models、Data），分别回答“融合什么”、“为何能融合”和“如何融合”三个核心问题。

Result: 该框架能够有效设计端到端解决方案，融合跨域多模态数据解决实际问题。

Conclusion: 跨域多模态数据融合是一个重要但研究不足的领域，提出的框架为解决这一问题提供了系统化的方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence has enabled a diversity of
applications that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds. As
physical environments are too complex to model through a single information
acquisition approach, it is crucial to fuse multimodal data generated by
different sources, such as sensors, devices, systems, and people, to solve a
problem in the real world. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor
sustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for
every problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is
vital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other
domains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on
fusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from
different datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not
hold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we
formally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its
unique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single
domain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models
and Data layers, answering three key questions: "what to fuse", "why can be
fused", and "how to fuse". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from
different domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy
of knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures. The Models Layer
provides two knowledge fusion paradigms based on the fundamental mechanisms for
processing data. The Data Layer turns data of different structures,
resolutions, scales and distributions into a consistent representation that can
be fed into an AI model. With this framework, we can design end-to-end
solutions that fuse cross-domain multimodal data effectively for solving
real-world problems.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 深度学习模型在处理特征不确定性时性能受限，尤其是在多模态场景中。DUAL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DUAL包含三个创新点：动态特征不确定性建模、自适应分布感知调制和不确定性感知的跨模态关系学习。

Result: 实验表明，DUAL在计算机视觉任务中提升了CIFAR-10（7.1%）、CIFAR-100（6.5%）和Tiny-ImageNet（2.3%）的准确率；在多模态学习中提升了CMU-MOSEI（4.1%）、CMU-MOSI（2.8%）和MISR（1.4%）的准确率。

Conclusion: DUAL有效提升了模型在特征不确定性场景下的性能，尤其在多模态学习中表现突出。

Abstract: Deep learning models frequently encounter feature uncertainty in diverse
learning scenarios, significantly impacting their performance and reliability.
This challenge is particularly complex in multi-modal scenarios, where models
must integrate information from different sources with inherent uncertainties.
We propose Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Learning (DUAL), a unified framework that
effectively handles feature uncertainty in both single-modal and multi-modal
scenarios. DUAL introduces three key innovations: Dynamic Feature Uncertainty
Modeling, which continuously refines uncertainty estimates through joint
consideration of feature characteristics and learning dynamics; Adaptive
Distribution-Aware Modulation, which maintains balanced feature distributions
through dynamic sample influence adjustment; and Uncertainty-aware Cross-Modal
Relationship Learning, which explicitly models uncertainties in cross-modal
interactions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate DUAL's
effectiveness across multiple domains: in computer vision tasks, it achieves
substantial improvements of 7.1% accuracy on CIFAR-10, 6.5% accuracy on
CIFAR-100, and 2.3% accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet; in multi-modal learning, it
demonstrates consistent gains of 4.1% accuracy on CMU-MOSEI and 2.8% accuracy
on CMU-MOSI for sentiment analysis, while achieving 1.4% accuracy improvements
on MISR. The code will be available on GitHub soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究BER估计方法在有限样本和多变量问题中的准确性，为分类问题的难度和最优性能提供参考。

Method: 利用蒙特卡洛模拟生成合成数据，比较kNN、广义Henze-Penrose（GHP）散度和核密度估计（KDE）方法在二元分类中的表现。

Result: kNN是最优的非参数估计方法，但需要每类至少1000个样本才能达到95%置信区间误差低于5%的目标。特征增多时，样本需求增加。

Conclusion: kNN在BER估计中表现出色，但高维问题中样本需求量显著增加，其他方法在高维时虽有改进但仍未达标。

Abstract: The Bayes Error Rate (BER) is the fundamental limit on the achievable
generalizable classification accuracy of any machine learning model due to
inherent uncertainty within the data. BER estimators offer insight into the
difficulty of any classification problem and set expectations for optimal
classification performance. In order to be useful, the estimators must also be
accurate with a limited number of samples on multivariate problems with unknown
class distributions. To determine which estimators meet the minimum
requirements for "usefulness", an in-depth examination of their accuracy is
conducted using Monte Carlo simulations with synthetic data in order to obtain
their confidence bounds for binary classification. To examine the usability of
the estimators on real-world applications, new test scenarios are introduced
upon which 2500 Monte Carlo simulations per scenario are run over a wide range
of BER values. In a comparison of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Generalized
Henze-Penrose (GHP) divergence and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques,
results show that kNN is overwhelmingly the more accurate non-parametric
estimator. In order to reach the target of an under 5 percent range for the 95
percent confidence bounds, the minimum number of required samples per class is
1000. As more features are added, more samples are needed, so that 2500 samples
per class are required at only 4 features. Other estimators do become more
accurate than kNN as more features are added, but continuously fail to meet the
target range.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 随着自动驾驶车辆的增加，准确分类SAE自动化级别对理解事故动态和系统责任至关重要，但现有方法往往忽略自动化特定因素且缺乏模型复杂性。

Method: 研究使用结构化事故数据（4649起案例），通过SMOTEENN进行类别平衡，训练并评估了三种深度学习模型（MambaAttention、TabPFN、TabTransformer）。

Result: MambaAttention表现最佳（F1分数：SAE 1为88%，SAE 2为97%，SAE 3-5为99%）；TabPFN在零样本推断中表现优异；TabTransformer表现较差（部分自动化F1分数：55%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对表格数据优化的深度学习模型能显著提升自动化级别分类的准确性和效率，有助于政策制定和AV安全评估。

Abstract: The increasing presence of automated vehicles (AVs) presents new challenges
for crash classification and safety analysis. Accurately identifying the SAE
automation level involved in each crash is essential to understanding crash
dynamics and system accountability. However, existing approaches often overlook
automation-specific factors and lack model sophistication to capture
distinctions between different SAE levels. To address this gap, this study
evaluates the performance of three advanced tabular deep learning models
MambaAttention, TabPFN, and TabTransformer for classifying SAE automation
levels using structured crash data from Texas (2024), covering 4,649 cases
categorized as Assisted Driving (SAE Level 1), Partial Automation (SAE Level
2), and Advanced Automation (SAE Levels 3-5 combined). Following class
balancing using SMOTEENN, the models were trained and evaluated on a unified
dataset of 7,300 records. MambaAttention demonstrated the highest overall
performance (F1-scores: 88% for SAE 1, 97% for SAE 2, and 99% for SAE 3-5),
while TabPFN excelled in zero-shot inference with high robustness for rare
crash categories. In contrast, TabTransformer underperformed, particularly in
detecting Partial Automation crashes (F1-score: 55%), suggesting challenges in
modeling shared human-system control dynamics. These results highlight the
capability of deep learning models tailored for tabular data to enhance the
accuracy and efficiency of automation-level classification. Integrating such
models into crash analysis frameworks can support policy development, AV safety
evaluation, and regulatory decisions, especially in distinguishing high-risk
conditions for mid- and high-level automation technologies.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统交通管理方法难以解决复杂的交通拥堵和碰撞问题，亟需创新方案。

Method: 开发了3D城市模拟环境、碰撞模型及基于PPO的强化学习框架，优先考虑安全性。

Result: 该方法将严重碰撞和车辆碰撞次数及总行驶距离减少3倍以上，燃油效率提升39%，碳排放减少88%。

Conclusion: 证明了3D模拟和强化学习在优化交通流、减少碰撞和排放方面的可行性。

Abstract: Traffic congestion and collisions represent significant economic,
environmental, and social challenges worldwide. Traditional traffic management
approaches have shown limited success in addressing these complex, dynamic
problems. To address the current research gaps, three potential tools are
developed: a comprehensive 3D city-wide simulation environment that integrates
both macroscopic and microscopic traffic dynamics; a collision model; and a
reinforcement learning framework with custom reward functions prioritizing
safety over efficiency. Unity game engine-based simulation is used for direct
collision modeling. A custom reward enabled reinforcement learning method,
proximal policy optimization (PPO) model, yields substantial improvements over
baseline results, reducing the number of serious collisions, number of
vehicle-vehicle collisions, and total distance travelled by over 3 times the
baseline values. The model also improves fuel efficiency by 39% and reduces
carbon emissions by 88%. Results establish feasibility for city-wide 3D traffic
simulation applications incorporating the vision-zero safety principles of the
Department of Transportation, including physics-informed, adaptable, realistic
collision modeling, as well as appropriate reward modeling for real-world
traffic signal light control towards reducing collisions, optimizing traffic
flow and reducing greenhouse emissions.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 动态变化的无线网络环境（如干扰、衰落和移动性）使得传统静态因果模型难以适用，因此需要新的方法来解决动态衰落无线环境中的因果推断问题。

Method: 提出了一种顺序回归算法，并结合NOTEARS无环性约束，支持高效在线更新，以解决动态环境中的因果推断问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计鲁棒的在线因果推断机制提供了理论依据和实用指导，以应对非平稳无线条件下的网络可靠性问题。

Abstract: Dynamic causal discovery in wireless networks is essential due to evolving
interference, fading, and mobility, which complicate traditional static causal
models. This paper addresses causal inference challenges in dynamic fading
wireless environments by proposing a sequential regression-based algorithm with
a novel application of the NOTEARS acyclicity constraint, enabling efficient
online updates. We derive theoretical lower and upper bounds on the detection
delay required to identify structural changes, explicitly quantifying their
dependence on network size, noise variance, and fading severity. Monte Carlo
simulations validate these theoretical results, demonstrating linear increases
in detection delay with network size, quadratic growth with noise variance, and
inverse-square dependence on the magnitude of structural changes. Our findings
provide rigorous theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing
robust online causal inference mechanisms to maintain network reliability under
nonstationary wireless conditions.

*Vignav Ramesh,Morteza Mardani*

Key words: 扩散模型,噪声轨迹优化,MDP,贪婪搜索,文本到图像生成

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种优化扩散模型中噪声轨迹的方法，通过将其建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）并引入一种贪婪搜索算法，显著提升了生成样本的质量和效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高保真样本时，通常通过增加去噪步骤来提升质量，但这种方法收益递减。优化噪声轨迹虽具潜力，但因高维搜索空间和复杂交互而困难。

Method: 将扩散过程建模为MDP，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）作为理论框架，但因其低效转而提出一种贪婪搜索算法，结合全局探索和局部利用。

Result: 在EDM和Stable Diffusion上的实验显示，该方法在类别条件/文本到图像生成任务中达到最优效果，性能提升高达164%，且与MCTS相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了对任意（非可微）奖励的噪声轨迹优化，平衡了性能与效率，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time
scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates
higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the
primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead
optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is
promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality;
but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex
noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this
by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal
reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to
be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then
resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of
independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an
$\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps
and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs.
Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for
class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to
$164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the
first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary
(non-differentiable) rewards.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有时间序列预测模型的复杂性使得设计理想架构困难，作者认为通过通用校准策略优化现有模型比从头训练更高效。

Method: 提出SoP策略，为每个预测目标保留独立的优化器和早停监控器（Plug），同时冻结主干模型（Socket），解决多目标学习冲突。

Result: 在多个时间序列基准和ERA5气象数据集上，SoP实现了高达22%的性能提升，即使使用简单的MLP作为Plug。

Conclusion: SoP是一种模型无关的高效校准策略，显著提升了时间序列预测模型的性能，资源消耗低。

Abstract: Deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in
time series forecasting. Despite these ongoing developments, the complex
dynamics of time series make it challenging to establish the rule of thumb for
designing the golden model architecture. In this study, we argue that refining
existing advanced models through a universal calibrating strategy can deliver
substantial benefits with minimal resource costs, as opposed to elaborating and
training a new model from scratch. We first identify a multi-target learning
conflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables
across time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose an innovative calibrating
strategy called Socket+Plug (SoP). This approach retains an exclusive optimizer
and early-stopping monitor for each predicted target within each Plug while
keeping the fully trained Socket backbone frozen. The model-agnostic nature of
SoP allows it to directly calibrate the performance of any trained deep
forecasting models, regardless of their specific architectures. Extensive
experiments on various time series benchmarks and a spatio-temporal
meteorological ERA5 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SoP, achieving up
to a 22% improvement even when employing a simple MLP as the Plug (highlighted
in Figure 1)

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RDK的新采样方法，旨在通过虚拟恢复被剔除的词汇来提升低词汇量草拟器的接受率，解决了现有采样方法无法处理未包含词汇的局限性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 为了解决大词汇量模型在草拟器中效率低下的问题，研究者希望找到一种方法，既能减少草拟器的词汇量，又不降低其接受率。

Method: 论文引入了Redistributing Drafter Kernels（RDK），一种能够恢复被剔除词汇的虚拟采样方法，通过重新分配草拟器的权重到高重叠区域。

Result: 实验表明，RDK显著提升了接受率，即使在高词汇量缩减（超过75%）的情况下，现有采样方法失效时仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: RDK为高词汇量裁剪草拟器提供了实用性，解决了以往难以实现的效率问题。

Abstract: Speculative decoding relies on fast and accurate drafters. Recent
state-of-the-art language models employ larger and larger vocabularies, which
significantly slows down drafters. One promising approach to boost the
efficiency of speculative decoding is to use drafters with smaller
vocabularies. However, existing sampling methods cannot draw out-of-vocabulary
tokens, creating a tradeoff between drafters' vocabulary size and acceptance
rates. This paper introduces Redistributing Drafter Kernels (RDK), the first
out-of-vocabulary sampler that effectively recovers acceptance rates by
virtually restoring pruned target tokens. RDK leverages token-affinity priors
to reallocate drafter mass towards high-overlap regions. We prove
mathematically that RDK can achieve higher acceptance rates than vanilla and
state-of-the-art samplers. We provide an efficient first-order approximation of
RDK and prove that it reduces redistribution times from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$,
enabling lightweight implementations for large vocabularies. Our experiments
demonstrate that this linear-time RDK significantly boosts acceptance rates
even after extreme pruning (removing more than 75% of the drafter's
vocabulary), where existing samplers fail. RDK opens the door to extremely
pruned drafters, which were previously impractical.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示FL环境中网络流量分析可能导致间接隐私泄露，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 利用多种深度学习架构（CNN、RNN）在FL测试床上实验，并通过SVM、随机森林和梯度提升算法分析流量数据。

Result: 实验结果显示随机森林达到100%识别准确率，SVM和梯度提升约95.7%，表明特定架构可被识别。

Conclusion: FL系统存在安全漏洞，需加强网络层防护以应对潜在攻击。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted as a decentralized machine
learning paradigm due to its capability to preserve data privacy by training
models without centralizing user data. However, FL is susceptible to indirect
privacy breaches via network traffic analysis-an area not explored in existing
research. The primary objective of this research is to study the feasibility of
fingerprinting deep learning models deployed within FL environments by
analyzing their network-layer traffic information. In this paper, we conduct an
experimental evaluation using various deep learning architectures (i.e., CNN,
RNN) within a federated learning testbed. We utilize machine learning
algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and
Gradient-Boosting, to fingerprint unique patterns within the traffic data. Our
experiments show high fingerprinting accuracy, achieving 100% accuracy using
Random Forest and around 95.7% accuracy using SVM and Gradient Boosting
classifiers. This analysis suggests that we can identify specific architectures
running within the subsection of the network traffic. Hence, if an adversary
knows about the underlying DL architecture, they can exploit that information
and conduct targeted attacks. These findings suggest a notable security
vulnerability in FL systems and the necessity of strengthening it at the
network level.

Motivation: 提高海洋预报的时空分辨率和计算效率，解决传统数值模型和数据驱动方法在细尺度预测中的不足。

Method: 结合上下文特征提取模块和堆叠注意力块的预测网络，核心创新是Mixture-of-Time（MoT）模块，自适应整合多时间背景预测。

Result: 在温度、盐度和海流等关键变量的多深度预测中表现出优越性。

Conclusion: FuXi-Ocean为数据驱动的高分辨率海洋预报提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution ocean forecasting is crucial for maritime
operations and environmental monitoring. While traditional numerical models are
capable of producing sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they are
computationally intensive and face challenges in maintaining accuracy at fine
spatial and temporal scales. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches offer
improved computational efficiency and emerging potential, yet typically operate
at daily resolution and struggle with sub-daily predictions due to error
accumulation over time. We introduce FuXi-Ocean, the first data-driven global
ocean forecasting model achieving six-hourly predictions at eddy-resolving
1/12{\deg} spatial resolution, reaching depths of up to 1500 meters. The model
architecture integrates a context-aware feature extraction module with a
predictive network employing stacked attention blocks. The core innovation is
the Mixture-of-Time (MoT) module, which adaptively integrates predictions from
multiple temporal contexts by learning variable-specific reliability ,
mitigating cumulative errors in sequential forecasting. Through comprehensive
experimental evaluation, FuXi-Ocean demonstrates superior skill in predicting
key variables, including temperature, salinity, and currents, across multiple
depths.

Result: 在Brax测试中，MF-PBT显著提升了样本效率和长期性能。

Conclusion: MF-PBT通过多频率进化有效解决PBT的短视性问题，为超参数优化提供新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of
instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for
practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed
to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out
for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed
configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own
hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers
with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause
PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local
optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales.
This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of
evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose
Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm
that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at
distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer
information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short
and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate
that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without
actually tuning hyperparameters.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 神经ODE和ResNet在行为上互为近似，但缺乏形式化的关系描述，因此需要研究两者之间的误差边界以简化验证过程。

Method: 通过数学分析确立神经ODE与ResNet之间的误差边界，利用这一边界实现两者之间的验证代理功能。

Result: 提出了可逆的验证代理方法，使得对其中一个模型的验证结果可通过误差边界直接应用于另一个模型。

Conclusion: 误差边界的引入显著简化了神经ODE与ResNet的验证过程，为模型安全性验证提供了高效工具。

Abstract: A neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a machine learning
model that is commonly described as a continuous depth generalization of a
residual network (ResNet) with a single residual block, or conversely, the
ResNet can be seen as the Euler discretization of the neural ODE. These two
models are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either
model are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In
this work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by
bounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained
error bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for
the other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable
output set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of
the models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the
other model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety
verification can be run indifferently on either of the two models. This novel
approach is illustrated on a numerical example of a fixed-point attractor
system modeled as a neural ODE.

Result: 在多项任务（如常识推理、代码生成等）中表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: DiaBlo在保持高内存效率和快速微调的同时，实现了与全模型微调相近的性能。

Abstract: Finetuning is a critical step for adapting large language models (LLMs) to
domain-specific downstream tasks. To mitigate the substantial computational and
memory costs of full-model fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT)
methods have been proposed to update only a small subset of model parameters.
However, performance gaps between PEFT approaches and full-model fine-tuning
still exist. In this work, we present DiaBlo, a simple yet effective PEFT
approach that updates only the diagonal blocks of selected model weight
matrices. Unlike Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, DiaBlo eliminates
the need for low rank matrix products, thereby avoiding the reliance on
auxiliary initialization schemes or customized optimization strategies to
improve convergence. This design leads to stable and robust convergence while
maintaining comparable memory efficiency and training speed to LoRA. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of tasks, including commonsense reasoning,
arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment, to evaluate the
effectiveness and efficiency of DiaBlo. Across these benchmarks, DiaBlo
demonstrates strong and consistent performance while maintaining high memory
efficiency and fast finetuning speed. Codes are available at

Result: 实验证明BadReward能有效引导目标概念生成不当图像（如偏见或暴力内容）。

Conclusion: 研究突显了多模态RLHF系统面临的新威胁，呼吁加强防御机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning
text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. However, RLHF's feedback
mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the
feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference
data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a
stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal
RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually
contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and
indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment
poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is
independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and
practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that
BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such
as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore
the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting
the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer. This paper contains uncensored

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统方法仅关注时间域解释，而研究表明时间域和频率域的属性可能并不一致，需多域解释以全面理解模型行为。

Method: 引入量子力学中的不确定性原理（UP）作为量化工具，判断两域属性是否违反UP边界，从而强调多域解释的必要性。

Result: 实验证明在不同模型和数据集上，UP违规频繁发生，表明仅关注时间域解释存在局限性。

Conclusion: 多域解释应作为新范式，以弥补传统单域解释的不足。

Abstract: A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate
attribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the
concept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can
be interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as
frequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the
time domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this
paper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate
attributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and
frequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This
suggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more
comprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain
explanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty
principle (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in
harmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle
establishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized
in both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess
whether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound,
indicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a
sufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not
match and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the
effectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI
methods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The
frequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods
highlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on
time-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain
explanations as a new paradigm.

Conclusion: 多出口KANs为科学建模提供高性能与可解释性的解决方案，解决了机器学习在科学发现中的核心挑战。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) uniquely combine high accuracy with
interpretability, making them valuable for scientific modeling. However, it is
unclear a priori how deep a network needs to be for any given task, and deeper
KANs can be difficult to optimize. Here we introduce multi-exit KANs, where
each layer includes its own prediction branch, enabling the network to make
accurate predictions at multiple depths simultaneously. This architecture
provides deep supervision that improves training while discovering the right
level of model complexity for each task. Multi-exit KANs consistently
outperform standard, single-exit versions on synthetic functions, dynamical
systems, and real-world datasets. Remarkably, the best predictions often come
from earlier, simpler exits, revealing that these networks naturally identify
smaller, more parsimonious and interpretable models without sacrificing
accuracy. To automate this discovery, we develop a differentiable "learning to
exit" algorithm that balances contributions from exits during training. Our
approach offers scientists a practical way to achieve both high performance and
interpretability, addressing a fundamental challenge in machine learning for
scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的预算在线主动学习方法，针对有限时域数据流和极低标签预算场景。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在农业应用中，数据流（如每日天气）需要昂贵的标签（如植物特性测量），而预算和时间有限。

Method: 方法整合了两类先验信息：专家预测器和基于无标签数据流的行为知识，同时考虑查询预算、有限时域和片段知识。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在极低标签预算下优于基线专家预测、统一查询选择和忽略片段知识的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在标签预算极低、时间有限的场景下表现出色，适用于农业等实际应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to budgeted online active learning
from finite-horizon data streams with extremely limited labeling budgets. In
agricultural applications, such streams might include daily weather data over a
growing season, and labels require costly measurements of weather-dependent
plant characteristics. Our method integrates two key sources of prior
information: a collection of preexisting expert predictors and episodic
behavioral knowledge of the experts based on unlabeled data streams. Unlike
previous research on online active learning with experts, our work
simultaneously considers query budgets, finite horizons, and episodic
knowledge, enabling effective learning in applications with severely limited
labeling capacity. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through
experiments on various prediction problems derived from both a realistic
agricultural crop simulator and real-world data from multiple grape cultivars.
The results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline expert
predictions, uniform query selection, and existing approaches that consider
budgets and limited horizons but neglect episodic knowledge, even under highly
constrained labeling budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和基础模型的兴起，论文旨在回答持续学习是否仍然重要，并提出了其在现代AI系统中的三大作用。

Method: 论文通过分析持续预训练、持续微调和持续组合性三个方向，论证了持续学习的必要性。

Result: 研究表明，持续学习在更新模型知识、任务适配性和模型动态组合中具有不可替代的作用。

Conclusion: 持续学习不仅是必要的，而且在未来AI发展中将以持续组合性为核心，形成动态演化的模型生态系统。

Abstract: Continual learning--the ability to acquire, retain, and refine knowledge over
time--has always been fundamental to intelligence, both human and artificial.
Historically, different AI paradigms have acknowledged this need, albeit with
varying priorities: early expert and production systems focused on incremental
knowledge consolidation, while reinforcement learning emphasised dynamic
adaptation. With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has
primarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to
solve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we
still need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle
diverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual
learning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is
still necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating
knowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information;
(ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise,
adapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints
without full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long
context-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular
approach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and
agents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual
pre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we
argue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual
learning. The future of AI will not be defined by a single static model but by
an ecosystem of continually evolving and interacting models, making continual
learning more relevant than ever.

Result: 实验表明，批量大小变化显著影响最佳探索策略，该方法能自动校准探索速率，优于启发式方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够根据具体问题设置动态优化探索策略，优于传统启发式方法。

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems rely on exploration to learn user preferences
for new items, typically implementing uniform exploration policies (e.g.,
epsilon-greedy) due to their simplicity and compatibility with machine learning
(ML) personalization models. Within these systems, a crucial consideration is
the rate of exploration - what fraction of user traffic should receive random
item recommendations and how this should evolve over time. While various
heuristics exist for navigating the resulting exploration-exploitation
tradeoff, selecting optimal exploration rates is complicated by practical
constraints including batched updates, time-varying user traffic, short time
horizons, and minimum exploration requirements. In this work, we propose a
principled framework for determining the exploration schedule based on directly
minimizing Bayesian regret through stochastic gradient descent (SGD), allowing
for dynamic exploration rate adjustment via Model-Predictive Control (MPC).
Through extensive experiments with recommendation datasets, we demonstrate that
variations in the batch size across periods significantly influence the optimal
exploration strategy. Our optimization methods automatically calibrate
exploration to the specific problem setting, consistently matching or
outperforming the best heuristic for each setting.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 知识图谱（KGs）虽然在推理能力上强大，但其不完整性和关系的长尾分布问题显著。为解决这一问题并扩展KGs的覆盖范围，少样本KG补全任务旨在仅需少量训练三元组作为参考的情况下对涉及新关系的三元组进行预测。

Method: 提出HiRe方法，通过联合捕捉实体级、三元组级和上下文级三个层次的关系信息，学习和优化少样本关系的元表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验验证了HiRe优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: HiRe通过多层次关系信息的联合学习，能够有效推广到未见过的关系。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities,
but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of
relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot
KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations
when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods
have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level
information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency
assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However,
pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information
have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot
relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method
(HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of
relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe
can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations,
and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art
methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/alexhw15/HiRe.git.

Conclusion: 本文成功地将分布强化学习方法扩展到平均奖励场景，为相关领域提供了新的研究方向和工具。

Abstract: To date, distributional reinforcement learning (distributional RL) methods
have exclusively focused on the discounted setting, where an agent aims to
optimize a potentially-discounted sum of rewards over time. In this work, we
extend distributional RL to the average-reward setting, where an agent aims to
optimize the reward received per time-step. In particular, we utilize a
quantile-based approach to develop the first set of algorithms that can
successfully learn and/or optimize the long-run per-step reward distribution,
as well as the differential return distribution of an average-reward MDP. We
derive proven-convergent tabular algorithms for both prediction and control, as
well as a broader family of algorithms that have appealing scaling properties.
Empirically, we find that these algorithms consistently yield competitive
performance when compared to their non-distributional equivalents, while also
capturing rich information about the long-run reward and return distributions.

Motivation: 联邦学习中的大语言模型微调面临巨大的内存和通信挑战，尤其是在非独立同分布（Non-IID）数据环境中。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了Meerkat方法。

Method: Meerkat采用稀疏零阶优化方法，仅微调静态且稀疏的参数子集，并通过虚拟路径机制识别极端Non-IID客户端。Meerkat-vp进一步利用GradIP现象进行分析和提前停止。

Result: 实验显示，Meerkat在高通信频率下表现优于全参数零阶优化方法，并在相同通信频率下超越现有稀疏基线。Meerkat-vp能有效识别极端Non-IID客户端并提升模型质量。

Conclusion: Meerkat和Meerkat-vp显著提高了联邦学习中大语言模型微调的效率和效果。

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) across decentralized Non-Independent and Identically Distributed
(Non-IID) clients, but such models' massive parameter sizes lead to significant
memory and communication challenges. This work introduces Meerkat, a sparse
zeroth-order optimization (ZO) method designed for federated LLM fine-tuning.
By limiting fine-tuning to a transferable, static, extremely sparse subset of
parameters, Meerkat achieves remarkable communication efficiency, enabling
cost-effective high-frequency synchronization. With theoretical analysis and
experiments, we show that this high-frequency communication effectively
mitigates Non-IID data challenges and leads to superior performance compared to
full-parameter ZO. Furthermore, experiment results show that Meerkat
outperforms existing sparsity baselines with better performance at the same
communication frequency. To further handle Non-IID drift, Meerkat leverages
traceable local updates and forms a virtual path for each client. This virtual
path mechanism reveals the GradIP phenomenon: the inner products between LLM
pre-training gradients maintained by server and client gradients estimated via
ZO converges for extreme Non-IID clients but oscillates for IID ones. This
distinct behavior provides a signal for identifying clients with extreme data
heterogeneity. Using this signal, Meerkat-vp is proposed to analyze GradIP
trajectories to identify extreme Non-IID clients and applies early stopping to
enhance aggregated model quality. Experiments confirm that Meerkat and
Meerkat-vp significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ZO
federated LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings.
This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the
pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language
models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image
encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this
work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient
adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to
large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial
accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided
by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we
can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our
robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under
adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text
encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via
direct optimization.

Conclusion: 方法高效且灵活，适用于多轮实验，并通过仿真验证了其有效性。

Abstract: A combinatorial intervention, consisting of multiple treatments applied to a
single unit with potentially interactive effects, has substantial applications
in fields such as biomedicine, engineering, and beyond. Given $p$ possible
treatments, conducting all possible $2^p$ combinatorial interventions can be
laborious and quickly becomes infeasible as $p$ increases. Here we introduce
probabilistic factorial experimental design, formalized from how scientists
perform lab experiments. In this framework, the experimenter selects a dosage
for each possible treatment and applies it to a group of units. Each unit
independently receives a random combination of treatments, sampled from a
product Bernoulli distribution determined by the dosages. Additionally, the
experimenter can carry out such experiments over multiple rounds, adapting the
design in an active manner. We address the optimal experimental design problem
within an intervention model that imposes bounded-degree interactions between
treatments. In the passive setting, we provide a closed-form solution for the
near-optimal design. Our results prove that a dosage of $\tfrac{1}{2}$ for each
treatment is optimal up to a factor of $1+O(\tfrac{\ln(n)}{n})$ for estimating
any $k$-way interaction model, regardless of $k$, and imply that
$O\big(kp^{3k}\ln(p)\big)$ observations are required to accurately estimate
this model. For the multi-round setting, we provide a near-optimal acquisition
function that can be numerically optimized. We also explore several extensions
of the design problem and finally validate our findings through simulations.

Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) techniques has allowed rapid advancements in
many scientific and engineering fields. One of these problems is that of
surface soil taxonomy, a research area previously hindered by the reliance on
human-derived classifications, which are mostly dependent on dividing a dataset
based on historical understandings of that data rather than data-driven,
statistically observable similarities. Using a ML-based taxonomy allows soil
researchers to move beyond the limitations of human visualization and create
classifications of high-dimension datasets with a much higher level of
specificity than possible with hand-drawn taxonomies. Furthermore, this
pipeline allows for the possibility of producing both highly accurate and
flexible soil taxonomies with classes built to fit a specific application. The
machine learning pipeline outlined in this work combines product quantization
with the systematic evaluation of parameters and output to get the best
available results, rather than accepting sub-optimal results by using either
default settings or best guess settings.

Abstract: We propose a new ternary spiking neuron model to improve the representation
capacity of binary spiking neurons in deep Q-learning. Although a ternary
neuron model has recently been introduced to overcome the limited
representation capacity offered by the binary spiking neurons, we show that its
performance is worse than that of binary models in deep Q-learning tasks. We
hypothesize gradient estimation bias during the training process as the
underlying potential cause through mathematical and empirical analysis. We
propose a novel ternary spiking neuron model to mitigate this issue by reducing
the estimation bias. We use the proposed ternary spiking neuron as the
fundamental computing unit in a deep spiking Q-learning network (DSQN) and
evaluate the network's performance in seven Atari games from the Gym
environment. Results show that the proposed ternary spiking neuron mitigates
the drastic performance degradation of ternary neurons in Q-learning tasks and
improves the network performance compared to the existing binary neurons,
making DSQN a more practical solution for on-board autonomous decision-making
tasks.

Result: 发现更大的数据集规模可以提升性能，且增加并行环境比增加rollout长度更有效。

Conclusion: 数据收集策略对智能体性能有重要影响，优化这些策略能显著提升强化学习效果。

Abstract: The use of parallel actors for data collection has been an effective
technique used in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The manner in which
data is collected in these algorithms, controlled via the number of parallel
environments and the rollout length, induces a form of bias-variance trade-off;
the number of training passes over the collected data, on the other hand, must
strike a balance between sample efficiency and overfitting. We conduct an
empirical analysis of these trade-offs on PPO, one of the most popular RL
algorithms that uses parallel actors, and establish connections to network
plasticity and, more generally, optimization stability. We examine its impact
on network architectures, as well as the hyper-parameter sensitivity when
scaling data. Our analyses indicate that larger dataset sizes can increase
final performance across a variety of settings, and that scaling parallel
environments is more effective than increasing rollout lengths. These findings
highlight the critical role of data collection strategies in improving agent
performance.

Abstract: Strategic litigation involves bringing a legal case to court with the goal of
having a broader impact beyond resolving the case itself: for example, creating
precedent which will influence future rulings. In this paper, we explore
strategic litigation from the perspective of machine learning theory. We
consider an abstract model of a common-law legal system where a lower court
decides new cases by applying a decision rule learned from a higher court's
past rulings. In this model, we explore the power of a strategic litigator, who
strategically brings cases to the higher court to influence the learned
decision rule, thereby affecting future cases. We explore questions including:
What impact can a strategic litigator have? Which cases should a strategic
litigator bring to court? Does it ever make sense for a strategic litigator to
bring a case when they are sure the court will rule against them?

Motivation: 传统In-Context Learning（ICL）和任务向量方法存在对演示顺序敏感、计算效率低及泛化能力不足的问题，ATV旨在通过动态任务向量实现更好的适应性。

Method: ATV利用一个小语言模型为每个输入查询动态生成任务向量，并将其适配到目标LLM架构中以指导输出生成。

Result: ATV在未见任务上表现出优异的性能和泛化能力，理论分析表明其表达力优于Prefix-Tuning。

Conclusion: ATV通过动态任务向量显著提升了模型适应性和泛化性能，为任务向量方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a few demonstrations
provided in the prompt. Despite its success, ICL suffers from several
limitations, including sensitivity to demonstration order, context length
constraints, and computational inefficiency. To address these challenges, task
vector-based approaches compress task information into a single vector.
However, these methods typically construct task vectors from fixed sets of
demonstrations and reuse them across input queries, without conditioning on the
specific input. This limitation can lead models to struggle with effective
adaptation when the input query is not well aligned with the underlying
demonstrations, consequently degrading their generalization performance on
unseen tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose Adaptive Task Vectors
(ATV), a simple and effective framework that dynamically generates task vectors
conditioned on each input query. ATV employs a small language model to generate
task vectors, which are then transformed to match the target LLM's architecture
and applied to guide its output generation. In contrast to ICL and previous
vector-based approaches, which rely on fixed demonstration sets and their
corresponding vectors, ATV dynamically generates task vectors tailored to each
specific input query and task. Consequently, ATV demonstrates strong
performance and generalization capabilities, even for unseen tasks.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis indicating that ATV is
expressively equivalent to LoRA under equal rank budgets and more expressive
than Prefix-Tuning, thereby offering formal support for its representational
advantage.

Abstract: As hypothesis generation becomes increasingly automated, a new bottleneck has
emerged: hypothesis assessment. Modern systems can surface thousands of
statistical relationships-correlations, trends, causal links-but offer little
guidance on which ones are novel, non-trivial, or worthy of expert attention.
In this work, we study the complementary problem to hypothesis generation:
automatic hypothesis assessment. Specifically, we ask: given a large set of
statistical relationships, can we automatically assess which ones are novel and
worth further exploration? We focus on correlations as they are a common entry
point in exploratory data analysis that often serve as the basis for forming
deeper scientific or causal hypotheses.
  To support automatic assessment, we propose to leverage the vast knowledge
encoded in LLMs' weights to derive a prior distribution over the correlation
value of a variable pair. If an LLM's prior expects the correlation value
observed, then such correlation is not surprising, and vice versa. We propose
the Logit-based Calibrated Prior, an LLM-elicited correlation prior that
transforms the model's raw output logits into a calibrated, continuous
predictive distribution over correlation values. We evaluate the prior on a
benchmark of 2,096 real-world variable pairs and it achieves a sign accuracy of
78.8%, a mean absolute error of 0.26, and 95% credible interval coverage of
89.2% in predicting Pearson correlation coefficient. It also outperforms a
fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier in binary correlation prediction and achieves
higher precision@K in hypothesis ranking. We further show that the prior
generalizes to correlations not seen during LLM pretraining, reflecting
context-sensitive reasoning rather than memorization.

Result: 随着嵌入维度的降低，可学习幺半群嵌入的性能明显优于固定DFT嵌入。

Conclusion: 方向性非交换幺半群嵌入框架能够学习任务特定的频率成分，提供紧凑且高效的数据表示。

Abstract: We present an empirical validation of the directional non-commutative
monoidal embedding framework recently introduced in prior
work~\cite{Godavarti2025monoidal}. This framework defines learnable
compositional embeddings using distinct non-commutative operators per dimension
(axis) that satisfy an interchange law, generalizing classical one-dimensional
transforms. Our primary goal is to verify that this framework can effectively
model real data by applying it to a controlled, well-understood task: image
classification on the MNIST dataset~\cite{lecun1998gradient}. A central
hypothesis for why the proposed monoidal embedding works well is that it
generalizes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)~\cite{oppenheim1999discrete}
by learning task-specific frequency components instead of using fixed basis
frequencies. We test this hypothesis by comparing learned monoidal embeddings
against fixed DFT-based embeddings on MNIST. The results show that as the
embedding dimensionality decreases (e.g., from 32 to 8 to 2), the performance
gap between the learned monoidal embeddings and fixed DFT-based embeddings on
MNIST grows increasingly large. This comparison is used as an analytic tool to
explain why the framework performs well: the learnable embeddings can capture
the most discriminative spectral components for the task. Overall, our
experiments confirm that directional non-commutative monoidal embeddings are
highly effective for representing image data, offering a compact learned
representation that retains high task performance. The code used in this work

Conclusion: CORE是一种通用的方法，适用于广泛的离散-连续约束设计问题。

Abstract: Simulation-based design space exploration (DSE) aims to efficiently optimize
high-dimensional structured designs under complex constraints and expensive
evaluation costs. Existing approaches, including heuristic and multi-step
reinforcement learning (RL) methods, struggle to balance sampling efficiency
and constraint satisfaction due to sparse, delayed feedback, and large hybrid
action spaces. In this paper, we introduce CORE, a constraint-aware, one-step
RL method for simulationguided DSE. In CORE, the policy agent learns to sample
design configurations by defining a structured distribution over them,
incorporating dependencies via a scaling-graph-based decoder, and by reward
shaping to penalize invalid designs based on the feedback obtained from
simulation. CORE updates the policy using a surrogate objective that compares
the rewards of designs within a sampled batch, without learning a value
function. This critic-free formulation enables efficient learning by
encouraging the selection of higher-reward designs. We instantiate CORE for
hardware-mapping co-design of neural network accelerators, demonstrating that
it significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves better accelerator
configurations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach is general
and applicable to a broad class of discrete-continuous constrained design
problems.

Abstract: Navigation path traces play a crucial role in video game design, serving as a
vital resource for both enhancing player engagement and fine-tuning
non-playable character behavior. Generating such paths with human-like realism
can enrich the overall gaming experience, and evaluating path traces can
provide game designers insights into player interactions. Despite the
impressive recent advancements in deep learning-based generative modeling, the
video game industry hesitates to adopt such models for path generation, often
citing their complex training requirements and interpretability challenges. To
address these problems, we propose a novel path generation and evaluation
approach that is grounded in principled nonparametric statistics and provides
precise control while offering interpretable insights. Our path generation
method fuses two statistical techniques: (1) nonparametric model-free
transformations that capture statistical characteristics of path traces through
time; and (2) copula models that capture statistical dependencies in space. For
path evaluation, we adapt a nonparametric three-sample hypothesis test designed
to determine if the generated paths are overfit (mimicking the original data
too closely) or underfit (diverging too far from it). We demonstrate the
precision and reliability of our proposed methods with empirical analysis on
two existing gaming benchmarks to showcase controlled generation of diverse
navigation paths. Notably, our novel path generator can be fine-tuned with user
controllable parameters to create navigation paths that exhibit varying levels
of human-likeness in contrast to those produced by neural network-based agents.

Result: 实验表明，C-MICL达到目标可行性率，保持竞争力，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: C-MICL为数学优化与机器学习结合提供了严格统计保证的原则性方法。

Abstract: We propose Conformal Mixed-Integer Constraint Learning (C-MICL), a novel
framework that provides probabilistic feasibility guarantees for data-driven
constraints in optimization problems. While standard Mixed-Integer Constraint
Learning methods often violate the true constraints due to model error or data
limitations, our C-MICL approach leverages conformal prediction to ensure
feasible solutions are ground-truth feasible. This guarantee holds with
probability at least $1{-}\alpha$, under a conditional independence assumption.
The proposed framework supports both regression and classification tasks
without requiring access to the true constraint function, while avoiding the
scalability issues associated with ensemble-based heuristics. Experiments on
real-world applications demonstrate that C-MICL consistently achieves target
feasibility rates, maintains competitive objective performance, and
significantly reduces computational cost compared to existing methods. Our work
bridges mathematical optimization and machine learning, offering a principled
approach to incorporate uncertainty-aware constraints into decision-making with
rigorous statistical guarantees.

Conclusion: 提出的GCM和IGCM方法有效地解决了严格和隐式单调问题，为单调建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In many machine learning tasks, it is often necessary for the relationship
between input and output variables to be monotonic, including both strictly
monotonic and implicitly monotonic relationships. Traditional methods for
maintaining monotonicity mainly rely on construction or regularization
techniques, whereas this paper shows that the issue of strict monotonic
probability can be viewed as a partial order between an observable revenue
variable and a latent cost variable. This perspective enables us to reformulate
the monotonicity challenge into modeling the latent cost variable. To tackle
this, we introduce a generative network for the latent cost variable, termed
the Generative Cost Model (GCM), which inherently addresses the strict
monotonic problem, and propose the Implicit Generative Cost Model (IGCM) to
address the implicit monotonic problem. We further validate our approach with a
numerical simulation of quantile regression and conduct multiple experiments on
public datasets, showing that our method significantly outperforms existing
monotonic modeling techniques. The code for our experiments can be found at

Conclusion: SDE算法有效提升采样均匀性和预测准确性，可降低半导体测试成本。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, testing costs remain significantly high,
especially during wafer and FPGA testing. To reduce the number of required
tests while maintaining predictive accuracy, this study investigates three
baseline sampling strategies: Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, and k-means
Clustering Sampling. To further enhance these methods, this study proposes a
novel algorithm that improves the sampling quality of each approach. This
research is conducted using real industrial production data from wafer-level
tests and silicon measurements from various FPGAs. This study introduces two
hybrid strategies: Stratified with Short Distance Elimination (S-SDE) and
k-means with Short Distance Elimination (K-SDE). Their performance is evaluated
within the framework of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting wafer
and FPGA test data. At the core of our proposed approach is the Short Distance
Elimination (SDE) algorithm, which excludes spatially proximate candidate
points during sampling, thereby ensuring a more uniform distribution of
training data across the physical domain. A parameter sweep was conducted over
the (alpha, beta) thresholds, where alpha and beta are in the range {0, 1, 2,
3, 4} and not both zero, to identify the optimal combination that minimizes
RMSD. Experimental results on a randomly selected wafer file reveal that
(alpha, beta) equal (2, 2) yields the lowest RMSD. Accordingly, all subsequent
experiments adopt this parameter configuration. The results demonstrate that
the proposed SDE-based strategies enhance predictive accuracy: K-SDE improves
upon k-means sampling by 16.26 percent (wafer) and 13.07 percent (FPGA), while
S-SDE improves upon stratified sampling by 16.49 percent (wafer) and 8.84
percent (FPGA).

Conclusion: 基于DS理论的新推断方案显著提升了LFCSs的透明度、可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The decision-making process significantly influences the predictions of
machine learning models. This is especially important in rule-based systems
such as Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) where the selection and
application of rules directly determine prediction accuracy and reliability.
LFCSs combine evolutionary algorithms with supervised learning to optimize
fuzzy classification rules, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness.
Despite these advantages, research on improving decision-making mechanisms
(i.e., class inference schemes) in LFCSs remains limited. Most LFCSs use
voting-based or single-winner-based inference schemes. These schemes rely on
classification performance on training data and may not perform well on unseen
data, risking overfitting. To address these limitations, this article
introduces a novel class inference scheme for LFCSs based on the
Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DS theory). The proposed scheme handles
uncertainty well. By using the DS theory, the scheme calculates belief masses
(i.e., measures of belief) for each specific class and the ``I don't know''
state from each fuzzy rule and infers a class from these belief masses. Unlike
the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme also considers the ``I don't
know'' state that reflects uncertainty, thereby improving the transparency and
reliability of LFCSs. Applied to a variant of LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS), the
proposed scheme demonstrates statistically significant improvements in terms of
test macro F1 scores across 30 real-world datasets compared to conventional
voting-based and single-winner-based fuzzy inference schemes. It forms smoother
decision boundaries, provides reliable confidence measures, and enhances the
robustness and generalizability of LFCSs in real-world applications. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/jUCS.

Abstract: Failure triage in design functional verification is critical but
time-intensive, relying on manual specification reviews, log inspections, and

failure triage, particularly for large designs, remains limited. VCDiag offers
an efficient, adaptable approach using VCD data to classify failing waveforms
and pinpoint likely failure locations. In the largest experiment, VCDiag
achieves over 94% accuracy in identifying the top three most likely modules.
The framework introduces a novel signal selection and statistical compression
approach, achieving over 120x reduction in raw data size while preserving
features essential for classification. It can also be integrated into diverse

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法为去除Shampoo的启发性方法提供了理论支持，有助于改进基于Kronecker分解的训练算法。

Abstract: The recent success of Shampoo in the AlgoPerf contest has sparked renewed
interest in Kronecker-factorization-based optimization algorithms for training
neural networks. Despite its success, Shampoo relies heavily on several
heuristics such as learning rate grafting and stale preconditioning to achieve
performance at-scale. These heuristics increase algorithmic complexity,
necessitate further hyperparameter tuning, and lack theoretical justification.
This paper investigates these heuristics from the angle of Frobenius norm
approximation to full-matrix Adam and decouples the preconditioner's
eigenvalues and eigenbasis updates. We show that grafting from Adam mitigates
the staleness and mis-scaling of the preconditioner's eigenvalues and how
correcting the eigenvalues directly can eliminate the need for learning rate
grafting. To manage the error induced by infrequent eigenbasis computations, we
propose an adaptive criterion for determining the eigenbasis computation
frequency motivated by terminating a warm-started QR algorithm. This criterion
decouples the update frequency of different preconditioner matrices and enables
us to investigate the impact of approximation error on convergence. These
practical techniques offer a principled angle towards removing Shampoo's
heuristics and developing improved Kronecker-factorization-based training
algorithms.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实分类任务中显著提高了测试精度，并生成更紧凑的规则集。

Conclusion: 四参数Beta分布的引入使LCS能够自适应选择规则表示，同时提高准确性和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and
decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems
(LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve
interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very
difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem.
Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for
different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is
needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This
article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta
distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta
distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our
LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different
subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision
boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by
controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as
trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the
appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS
incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible,
enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental
results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves
significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/Beta4-UCS. An

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架有效平衡了隐私保护与模型准确性，为联邦学习在CPSS中的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Federated learning, as a distributed architecture, shows great promise for
applications in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). In order to mitigate the
privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with
federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research
mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain
gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However,
these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct
the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy
of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a
novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances
rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient
correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and
noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local
gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the
negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the
alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model towards
convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark
datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.

Abstract: This paper studies a novel problem of out-of-distribution graph models
merging, which aims to construct a generalized model from multiple graph models
pre-trained on different domains with distribution discrepancy. This problem is
challenging because of the difficulty in learning domain-invariant knowledge
implicitly in model parameters and consolidating expertise from potentially
heterogeneous GNN backbones. In this work, we propose a graph generation
strategy that instantiates the mixture distribution of multiple domains. Then,
we merge and fine-tune the pre-trained graph models via a MoE module and a
masking mechanism for generalized adaptation. Our framework is
architecture-agnostic and can operate without any source/target domain data.
Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the model generalization problem.

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future
outcomes of ongoing business processes. However, existing methods often lack
flexibility to handle real-world challenges such as simultaneous events, class
imbalance, and multi-level attributes. While prior work has explored static
encoding schemes and fixed LSTM architectures, they struggle to support
adaptive representations and generalize across heterogeneous datasets. To
address these limitations, we propose a suite of dynamic LSTM HyperModels that
integrate two-level hierarchical encoding for event and sequence attributes,
character-based decomposition of event labels, and novel pseudo-embedding
techniques for durations and attribute correlations. We further introduce
specialized LSTM variants for simultaneous event modeling, leveraging
multidimensional embeddings and time-difference flag augmentation. Experimental
validation on four public and real-world datasets demonstrates up to 100%
accuracy on balanced datasets and F1 scores exceeding 86\% on imbalanced ones.
Our approach advances PBPM by offering modular and interpretable models better
suited for deployment in complex settings. Beyond PBPM, it contributes to the
broader AI community by improving temporal outcome prediction, supporting data
heterogeneity, and promoting explainable process intelligence frameworks.

Method: 引入学习临界性（LaC）方案，通过强化学习调优LLMs至学习临界点，并结合最小概念网络模型（CoNet）分析其动态特性。

Result: LaC在量子场论中显著优于大规模模型，成功解决未见过的高阶符号问题，验证了临界点的泛化优势。

Conclusion: LaC通过物理临界现象原理，为AI在数据稀缺的复杂问题中提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few
guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI)
offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its
use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality
(LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models
(LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At
this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data,
exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic
reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model
(CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained
on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition.
This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably
power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system
maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by
the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak
performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable
the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum
field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a
few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems,
significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical
phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse
challenges in fundamental physics.

Result: 两种损失形式在统计性能上相当，封闭形式甚至可能提升性能。

Conclusion: 流匹配的泛化能力主要不依赖损失的随机性。

Abstract: Modern deep generative models can now produce high-quality synthetic samples
that are often indistinguishable from real training data. A growing body of
research aims to understand why recent methods -- such as diffusion and flow
matching techniques -- generalize so effectively. Among the proposed
explanations are the inductive biases of deep learning architectures and the
stochastic nature of the conditional flow matching loss. In this work, we rule
out the latter -- the noisy nature of the loss -- as a primary contributor to
generalization in flow matching. First, we empirically show that in
high-dimensional settings, the stochastic and closed-form versions of the flow
matching loss yield nearly equivalent losses. Then, using state-of-the-art flow
matching models on standard image datasets, we demonstrate that both variants
achieve comparable statistical performance, with the surprising observation
that using the closed-form can even improve performance.

Result: 通过实际机器学习问题的广泛实验，验证了所提方法的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 改进的Sign-SGD方法在实际应用中表现出色，为资源密集型训练提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Quite recently, large language models have made a significant breakthrough
across various disciplines. However, training them is an extremely
resource-intensive task, even for major players with vast computing resources.
One of the methods gaining popularity in light of these challenges is Sign-SGD.
This method can be applied both as a memory-efficient approach in single-node
training and as a gradient compression technique in the distributed learning.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to automatically determine the effective
stepsize from the theoretical standpoint. Indeed, it depends on the parameters
of the dataset to which we do not have access in the real-world learning
paradigm. To address this issue, we design several variants of single-node
deterministic Sign-SGD. We extend our approaches to practical scenarios:
stochastic single-node and multi-node learning, methods with incorporated
momentum. We conduct extensive experiments on real machine learning problems
that emphasize the practical applicability of our ideas.

Motivation: 尽管PPO算法在实践中表现优异，但缺乏理论保障。本文旨在通过引入Fisher-Rao几何改进PPO，提供理论支持。

Method: 利用Fisher-Rao几何设计了一个更紧的代理损失函数，提出FR-PPO算法。

Result: FR-PPO在表格设置中实现了次线性收敛，且不依赖动作或状态空间的维度。

Conclusion: FR-PPO为PPO类算法提供了理论收敛性保证，是重要的一步。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has become a widely adopted algorithm for
reinforcement learning, offering a practical policy gradient method with strong
empirical performance. Despite its popularity, PPO lacks formal theoretical
guarantees for policy improvement and convergence. PPO is motivated by Trust
Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) that utilizes a surrogate loss with a KL
divergence penalty, which arises from linearizing the value function within a
flat geometric space. In this paper, we derive a tighter surrogate in the
Fisher-Rao (FR) geometry, yielding a novel variant, Fisher-Rao PPO (FR-PPO).
Our proposed scheme provides strong theoretical guarantees, including monotonic
policy improvement. Furthermore, in the tabular setting, we demonstrate that
FR-PPO achieves sub-linear convergence without any dependence on the
dimensionality of the action or state spaces, marking a significant step toward
establishing formal convergence results for PPO-based algorithms.

Conclusion: 权重归一化为CrossQ提供了一种无需激进干预的稳健解决方案，显著提升了样本效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, but sample
efficiency remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. Recently, CrossQ
has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data
(UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with
higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics which are
emphasized by higher UTDs, particularly Q-bias explosion and the growing
magnitude of critic network weights. To address this, we integrate weight
normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training,
prevents potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate
constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios,
achieving competitive or superior performance across a range of challenging
tasks on the DeepMind control benchmark, notably the complex dog and humanoid
environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as
network resets, and offers a robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and
scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.

Result: 理论分析表明FedFACT在给定公平水平下接近最优精度，实验显示其在多种数据集上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FedFACT为联邦学习中公平性与准确性的权衡提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: With emerging application of Federated Learning (FL) in decision-making
scenarios, it is imperative to regulate model fairness to prevent disparities
across sensitive groups (e.g., female, male). Current research predominantly
focuses on two concepts of group fairness within FL: Global Fairness (overall
model disparity across all clients) and Local Fairness (the disparity within
each client). However, the non-decomposable, non-differentiable nature of
fairness criteria pose two fundamental, unresolved challenges for fair FL: (i)
Harmonizing global and local fairness in multi-class classification; (ii)
Enabling a controllable, optimal accuracy-fairness trade-off. To tackle the
aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel controllable federated
group-fairness calibration framework, named FedFACT. FedFACT identifies the
Bayes-optimal classifiers under both global and local fairness constraints in
multi-class case, yielding models with minimal performance decline while
guaranteeing fairness. To effectively realize an adjustable, optimal
accuracy-fairness balance, we derive specific characterizations of the
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for reformulating fair FL as personalized
cost-sensitive learning problem for in-processing, and bi-level optimization
for post-processing. Theoretically, we provide convergence and generalization
guarantees for FedFACT to approach the near-optimal accuracy under given
fairness levels. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various data
heterogeneity demonstrate that FedFACT consistently outperforms baselines in
balancing accuracy and global-local fairness.

Motivation: 探索深度神经网络表示相似性的原因和条件，从理论层面解释模型分布的接近与表示相似性的关系。

Method: 基于可识别性理论，分析模型分布间的KL散度和表示的相似性，并通过CIFAR-10实验验证理论。

Result: 证明小的KL散度不保证表示相似性，定义了新的分布距离，发现更宽的网络的表示更相似。

Conclusion: 模型分布接近性与表示相似性之间存在联系，但传统KL散度不足以衡量这种关系。

Abstract: When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are
similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from
the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of
representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave
the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes
several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models,
we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar
representations. We prove that a small Kullback-Leibler divergence between the
model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations
are similar. This has the important corollary that models arbitrarily close to
maximizing the likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations, a
phenomenon mirrored in our empirical observations on models trained on
CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies
representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider
networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and
have more similar representations. Our results establish a link between
closeness in distribution and representational similarity.

Motivation: Transformer架构虽流行但缺乏数学解释且可能冗余，希望通过表示学习压缩噪音并仅保留必要组件。

Method: 通过多头部自注意力进行迭代去噪操作，构建紧凑网络架构，仅包含自注意力操作和跳跃连接。

Result: 实验表明，该架构在视觉和语言任务上的性能接近标准Transformer，同时具有更高的效率。

Conclusion: 简化且可解释的Transformer架构证明了自注意力操作在表示学习中的高效性，同时减少了冗余组件。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of transformers in practice, their architectures are
empirically designed and neither mathematically justified nor interpretable.
Moreover, as indicated by many empirical studies, some components of
transformer architectures may be redundant. To derive a fully interpretable
transformer architecture with only necessary components, we contend that the
goal of representation learning is to compress a set of noisy initial token
representations towards a mixture of low-dimensional subspaces. To compress
these noisy token representations, an associated denoising operation naturally
takes the form of a multi-head (subspace) self-attention. By unrolling such
iterative denoising operations into a deep network, we arrive at a highly
compact architecture that consists of \textit{only} self-attention operators
with skip connections at each layer. Moreover, we show that each layer performs
highly efficient denoising: it improves the signal-to-noise ratio of token
representations \textit{at a linear rate} with respect to the number of layers.
Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on vision and language tasks
demonstrate that such a transformer achieves performance close to that of
standard transformer architectures such as GPT-2 and CRATE.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了学习均衡问题，并具有理论保障。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning an equilibrium in a generalized
two-sided matching market, where agents can adaptively choose their actions
based on their assigned matches. Specifically, we consider a setting in which
matched agents engage in a zero-sum game with initially unknown payoff
matrices, and we explore whether a centralized procedure can learn an
equilibrium from bandit feedback. We adopt the solution concept of matching
equilibrium, where a pair consisting of a matching $\mathfrak{m}$ and a set of
agent strategies $X$ forms an equilibrium if no agent has the incentive to
deviate from $(\mathfrak{m}, X)$. To measure the deviation of a given pair
$(\mathfrak{m}, X)$ from the equilibrium pair $(\mathfrak{m}^\star, X^\star)$,
we introduce matching instability that can serve as a regret measure for the
corresponding learning problem. We then propose a UCB algorithm in which agents
form preferences and select actions based on optimistic estimates of the game
payoffs, and prove that it achieves sublinear, instance-independent regret over
a time horizon $T$.

Conclusion: JCPGNN-M是一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于密集无线网络中的资源分配问题。

Abstract: As the number of mobile devices continues to grow, interference has become a
major bottleneck in improving data rates in wireless networks. Efficient joint
channel and power allocation (JCPA) is crucial for managing interference. In
this paper, we first propose an enhanced WMMSE (eWMMSE) algorithm to solve the
JCPA problem in multi-channel wireless networks. To reduce the computational
complexity of iterative optimization, we further introduce JCPGNN-M, a graph
neural network-based solution that enables simultaneous multi-channel
allocation for each user. We reformulate the problem as a Lagrangian function,
which allows us to enforce the total power constraints systematically. Our
solution involves combining this Lagrangian framework with GNNs and iteratively
updating the Lagrange multipliers and resource allocation scheme. Unlike
existing GNN-based methods that limit each user to a single channel, JCPGNN-M
supports efficient spectrum reuse and scales well in dense network scenarios.
Simulation results show that JCPGNN-M achieves better data rate compared to
eWMMSE. Meanwhile, the inference time of JCPGNN-M is much lower than eWMMS, and
it can generalize well to larger networks.

Conclusion: 通过系统研究超参数的影响，本研究为未来的AL研究提供了可重复性和可信度更高的方法。

Abstract: Annotating data is a time-consuming and costly task, but it is inherently
required for supervised machine learning. Active Learning (AL) is an
established method that minimizes human labeling effort by iteratively
selecting the most informative unlabeled samples for expert annotation, thereby
improving the overall classification performance. Even though AL has been known
for decades, AL is still rarely used in real-world applications. As indicated
in the two community web surveys among the NLP community about AL, two main
reasons continue to hold practitioners back from using AL: first, the
complexity of setting AL up, and second, a lack of trust in its effectiveness.
We hypothesize that both reasons share the same culprit: the large
hyperparameter space of AL. This mostly unexplored hyperparameter space often
leads to misleading and irreproducible AL experiment results. In this study, we
first compiled a large hyperparameter grid of over 4.6 million hyperparameter
combinations, second, recorded the performance of all combinations in the
so-far biggest conducted AL study, and third, analyzed the impact of each
hyperparameter in the experiment results. In the end, we give recommendations
about the influence of each hyperparameter, demonstrate the surprising
influence of the concrete AL strategy implementation, and outline an
experimental study design for reproducible AL experiments with minimal
computational effort, thus contributing to more reproducible and trustworthy AL
research in the future.

Conclusion: 任务特定的监督学习方法能更有效地支持下游任务，优于传统均方误差优化。

Abstract: We consider learning a predictive model to be subsequently used for a given
downstream task (described by an algorithm) that requires access to the model
evaluation. This task need not be prediction, and this situation is frequently
encountered in machine-learning-augmented scientific computing. We show that
this setting differs from classical supervised learning, and in general it
cannot be solved by minimizing the mean square error of the model predictions
as is frequently performed in the literature. Instead, we find that the maximum
prediction error on the support of the downstream task algorithm can serve as
an effective estimate for the subsequent task performance. With this insight,
we formulate a task-specific supervised learning problem based on the given
sampling measure, whose solution serves as a reliable surrogate model for the
downstream task. Then, we discretize the empirical risk based on training data,
and develop an iterative algorithm to solve the task-specific supervised
learning problem. Three illustrative numerical examples on trajectory
prediction, optimal control and minimum energy path computation demonstrate the
effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: UIVI方法可通过重要性采样和KL散度优化显著提升性能。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed growing interest in semi-implicit variational
inference (SIVI) methods due to their ability to rapidly generate samples from
complex distributions. However, since the likelihood of these samples is
non-trivial to estimate in high dimensions, current research focuses on finding
effective SIVI training routines. Although unbiased implicit variational
inference (UIVI) has largely been dismissed as imprecise and computationally
prohibitive because of its inner MCMC loop, we revisit this method and show
that UIVI's MCMC loop can be effectively replaced via importance sampling and
the optimal proposal distribution can be learned stably by minimizing an
expected forward Kullback-Leibler divergence without bias. Our refined approach
demonstrates superior performance or parity with state-of-the-art methods on
established SIVI benchmarks.

Result: 在四项微调任务中，VAA显著降低有害分数并保持下游任务性能，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VAA通过关注数据易受攻击性，提升了安全对齐的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning (HFT), performed directly on open-source LLMs or through
Fine-tuning-as-a-Service, breaks safety alignment and poses significant
threats. Existing methods aim to mitigate HFT risks by learning robust
representation on alignment data or making harmful data unlearnable, but they
treat each data sample equally, leaving data vulnerability patterns
understudied. In this work, we reveal that certain subsets of alignment data
are consistently more prone to forgetting during HFT across different
fine-tuning tasks. Inspired by these findings, we propose Vulnerability-Aware
Alignment (VAA), which estimates data vulnerability, partitions data into
"vulnerable" and "invulnerable" groups, and encourages balanced learning using
a group distributionally robust optimization (Group DRO) framework.
Specifically, VAA learns an adversarial sampler that samples examples from the
currently underperforming group and then applies group-dependent adversarial
perturbations to the data during training, aiming to encourage a balanced
learning process across groups. Experiments across four fine-tuning tasks
demonstrate that VAA significantly reduces harmful scores while preserving
downstream task performance, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 通过候选标注范式及CanDist框架，显著提升了数据标注质量，优于直接使用单一标签的方法。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated
with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an
aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each
unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often
produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data
quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human
behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large
language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring
uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we
develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations
with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification
demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers
superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations.
Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at

Abstract: The misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer emotions from text for
malicious purposes, known as emotion inference attacks, poses a significant
threat to user privacy. In this paper, we investigate the potential of Apple
Intelligence's writing tools, integrated across iPhone, iPad, and MacBook, to
mitigate these risks through text modifications such as rewriting and tone
adjustment. By developing early novel datasets specifically for this purpose,
we empirically assess how different text modifications influence LLM-based
detection. This capability suggests strong potential for Apple Intelligence's
writing tools as privacy-preserving mechanisms. Our findings lay the groundwork
for future adaptive rewriting systems capable of dynamically neutralizing
sensitive emotional content to enhance user privacy. To the best of our
knowledge, this research provides the first empirical analysis of Apple
Intelligence's text-modification tools within a privacy-preservation context
with the broader goal of developing on-device, user-centric privacy-preserving
mechanisms to protect against LLMs-based advanced inference attacks on deployed
systems.

Abstract: When training autoregressive models for dynamical systems, a critical
question arises: how far into the future should the model be trained to
predict? Too short a horizon may miss long-term trends, while too long a
horizon can impede convergence due to accumulating prediction errors. In this
work, we formalize this trade-off by analyzing how the geometry of the loss
landscape depends on the training horizon. We prove that for chaotic systems,
the loss landscape's roughness grows exponentially with the training horizon,
while for limit cycles, it grows linearly, making long-horizon training
inherently challenging. However, we also show that models trained on long
horizons generalize well to short-term forecasts, whereas those trained on
short horizons suffer exponentially (resp. linearly) worse long-term
predictions in chaotic (resp. periodic) systems. We validate our theory through
numerical experiments and discuss practical implications for selecting training
horizons. Our results provide a principled foundation for hyperparameter
optimization in autoregressive forecasting models.

Conclusion: 研究为条件双样本检验提供了理论基础和实用方案，并推进了向量值最小二乘估计的最新进展。

Abstract: We propose a framework for hypothesis testing on conditional probability
distributions, which we then use to construct conditional two-sample
statistical tests. These tests identify the inputs -- called covariates in this
context -- where two conditional expectations differ with high probability. Our
key idea is to transform confidence bounds of a learning method into a
conditional two-sample test, and we instantiate this principle for kernel ridge
regression (KRR) and conditional kernel mean embeddings. We generalize existing
pointwise-in-time or time-uniform confidence bounds for KRR to
previously-inaccessible yet essential cases such as infinite-dimensional
outputs with non-trace-class kernels. These bounds enable circumventing the
need for independent data in our statistical tests, since they allow online
sampling. We also introduce bootstrapping schemes leveraging the parametric
form of testing thresholds identified in theory to avoid tuning inaccessible
parameters, making our method readily applicable in practice. Such conditional
two-sample tests are especially relevant in applications where data arrive
sequentially or non-independently, or when output distributions vary with
operational parameters. We demonstrate their utility through examples in
process monitoring and comparison of dynamical systems. Overall, our results
establish a comprehensive foundation for conditional two-sample testing, from
theoretical guarantees to practical implementation, and advance the
state-of-the-art on the concentration of vector-valued least squares
estimation.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 材料设计问题通常涉及多变量优化，传统的DOE方法如Taguchi技术虽能高效采样，但无法捕捉变量的非线性关系，因此探索ML方法以克服这些限制。

Method: 研究比较了Taguchi方法（使用L25正交阵列）和GPR模型（结合拉丁超立方采样和不确定性探索）在WAAM工艺中的应用。

Result: GPR模型在15个测试案例中表现出更高的准确性和效率，优于Taguchi方法。

Conclusion: GPR方法适用于需要高效探索复杂参数的材料加工领域，尤其是在非线性关系显著的情况下。

Abstract: Materials design problems often require optimizing multiple variables,
rendering full factorial exploration impractical. Design of experiment (DOE)
methods, such as Taguchi technique, are commonly used to efficiently sample the
design space but they inherently lack the ability to capture non-linear
dependency of process variables. In this work, we demonstrate how machine
learning (ML) methods can be used to overcome these limitations. We compare the
performance of Taguchi method against an active learning based Gaussian process
regression (GPR) model in a wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process to
accurately predict aspects of bead geometry, including penetration depth, bead
width, and height. While Taguchi method utilized a three-factor, five-level L25
orthogonal array to suggest weld parameters, the GPR model used an
uncertainty-based exploration acquisition function coupled with latin hypercube
sampling for initial training data. Accuracy and efficiency of both models was
evaluated on 15 test cases, with GPR outperforming Taguchi in both metrics.
This work applies to broader materials processing domain requiring efficient
exploration of complex parameters.

Conclusion: 研究通过理论分析和数值实验，证明了在平均情况下个性化的价值有限，同时提出的算法在实践中表现优异。

Abstract: Points-based rewards programs are a prevalent way to incentivize customer
loyalty; in these programs, customers who make repeated purchases from a seller
accumulate points, working toward eventual redemption of a free reward. These
programs have recently come under scrutiny due to accusations of unfair
practices in their implementation. Motivated by these concerns, we study the
problem of fairly designing points-based rewards programs, with a focus on two
obstacles that put fairness at odds with their effectiveness. First, due to
customer heterogeneity, the seller should set different redemption thresholds
for different customers to generate high revenue. Second, the relationship
between customer behavior and the number of accumulated points is typically
unknown; this requires experimentation which may unfairly devalue customers'
previously earned points. We first show that an individually fair rewards
program that uses the same redemption threshold for all customers suffers a
loss in revenue of at most a factor of $1+\ln 2$, compared to the optimal
personalized strategy that differentiates between customers. We then tackle the
problem of designing temporally fair learning algorithms in the presence of
demand uncertainty. Toward this goal, we design a learning algorithm that
limits the risk of point devaluation due to experimentation by only changing
the redemption threshold $O(\log T)$ times, over a horizon of length $T$. This
algorithm achieves the optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors)
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in expectation. We then modify this algorithm
to only ever decrease redemption thresholds, leading to improved fairness at a
cost of only a constant factor in regret. Extensive numerical experiments show
the limited value of personalization in average-case settings, in addition to
demonstrating the strong practical performance of our proposed learning
algorithms.

Result: SEMoLA能在多种数据集和数据模态中稳健地发现相关对称性并保持高预测精度。

Conclusion: SEMoLA无需先验知识，具有可解释性，并能应对分布变化。

Abstract: Recently, a trend has emerged that favors learning relevant symmetries from
data in geometric domains instead of designing constrained architectures. To do
so, two popular options are (1) to modify the training protocol, e.g., with a
specific loss and data augmentations (soft equivariance), or (2) to ignore
equivariance and infer it only implicitly. However, both options have
limitations: soft equivariance requires a priori knowledge about relevant
symmetries, while inferring symmetries merely via the task and larger data
lacks interpretability. To address both limitations, we propose SEMoLA, an
end-to-end approach that jointly (1) discovers a priori unknown symmetries in
the data via learnable data augmentations, and (2) softly encodes the
respective approximate equivariance into an arbitrary unconstrained model.
Hence, it does not need prior knowledge about symmetries, it offers
interpretability, and it maintains robustness to distribution shifts.
Empirically, we demonstrate the ability of SEMoLA to robustly discover relevant
symmetries while achieving high prediction accuracy across various datasets,
encompassing multiple data modalities and underlying symmetry groups.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 目前LTH在卷积神经网络中研究较多，但对GNNs的理论支持不足，因此需要探索GNNs中稀疏子网络表达能力的作用。

Method: 通过分析稀疏初始化GNN的表达能力，并与Weisfeiler-Leman测试对比，提出并证明了Strong Expressive Lottery Ticket Hypothesis。

Result: 稀疏初始化GNN的表达能力提升可加速模型收敛并改善泛化性能，研究为LTH和GNN提供了新的理论基础。

Conclusion: 维持稀疏初始化GNN的表达能力对性能至关重要，研究结果对药物发现等领域有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) is well-studied for convolutional neural
networks but has been validated only empirically for graph neural networks
(GNNs), for which theoretical findings are largely lacking. In this paper, we
identify the expressivity of sparse subnetworks, i.e. their ability to
distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, as crucial for finding winning tickets that
preserve the predictive performance. We establish conditions under which the
expressivity of a sparsely initialized GNN matches that of the full network,
particularly when compared to the Weisfeiler-Leman test, and in that context
put forward and prove a Strong Expressive Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. We
subsequently show that an increased expressivity in the initialization
potentially accelerates model convergence and improves generalization. Our
findings establish novel theoretical foundations for both LTH and GNN research,
highlighting the importance of maintaining expressivity in sparsely initialized
GNNs. We illustrate our results using examples from drug discovery.

Motivation: 研究动机是验证体积假设（volume hypothesis）是否适用于宽和深神经网络，即是否可以不依赖梯度下降而通过G&C实现泛化能力。

Method: 研究方法包括理论分析和实证验证，主要针对矩阵分解（线性和非线性激活）这一神经网络理论的常见测试平台。

Result: 结果表明，G&C的泛化能力随宽度增加而下降，但随深度增加而改善，首次证明G&C在某些情况下明显劣于梯度下降。

Conclusion: 结论指出，即使在简单设置中，神经网络是否需要梯度下降才能泛化良好可能没有简单答案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom attributes the mysterious generalization abilities of
overparameterized neural networks to gradient descent (and its variants). The
recent volume hypothesis challenges this view: it posits that these
generalization abilities persist even when gradient descent is replaced by
Guess & Check (G&C), i.e., by drawing weight settings until one that fits the
training data is found. The validity of the volume hypothesis for wide and deep
neural networks remains an open question. In this paper, we theoretically
investigate this question for matrix factorization (with linear and non-linear
activation)--a common testbed in neural network theory. We first prove that
generalization under G&C deteriorates with increasing width, establishing what
is, to our knowledge, the first case where G&C is provably inferior to gradient
descent. Conversely, we prove that generalization under G&C improves with
increasing depth, revealing a stark contrast between wide and deep networks,
which we further validate empirically. These findings suggest that even in
simple settings, there may not be a simple answer to the question of whether
neural networks need gradient descent to generalize well.

Result: HLRC在合成和真实超图数据集中均能揭示高阶结构，区分社区内/外超边，并支持聚类等任务。

Conclusion: HLRC为超图分析提供了通用基础，适用于节点分类、异常检测等复杂系统任务。

Abstract: Networks with higher-order interactions, prevalent in biological, social, and
information systems, are naturally represented as hypergraphs, yet their
structural complexity poses fundamental challenges for geometric
characterization. While curvature-based methods offer powerful insights in
graph analysis, existing extensions to hypergraphs suffer from critical
trade-offs: combinatorial approaches such as Forman-Ricci curvature capture
only coarse features, whereas geometric methods like Ollivier-Ricci curvature
offer richer expressivity but demand costly optimal transport computations. To
address these challenges, we introduce hypergraph lower Ricci curvature (HLRC),
a novel curvature metric defined in closed form that achieves a principled
balance between interpretability and efficiency. Evaluated across diverse
synthetic and real-world hypergraph datasets, HLRC consistently reveals
meaningful higher-order organization, distinguishing intra- from
inter-community hyperedges, uncovering latent semantic labels, tracking
temporal dynamics, and supporting robust clustering of hypergraphs based on
global structure. By unifying geometric sensitivity with algorithmic
simplicity, HLRC provides a versatile foundation for hypergraph analytics, with
broad implications for tasks including node classification, anomaly detection,
and generative modeling in complex systems.

Result: 实验表明，Dual-Arch显著提升现有方法的性能，同时参数规模减少高达87%。

Conclusion: Dual-Arch有效解决了架构层面的稳定性与可塑性矛盾，为持续学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The quest for Continual Learning (CL) seeks to empower neural networks with
the ability to learn and adapt incrementally. Central to this pursuit is
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma, which involves striking a balance
between two conflicting objectives: preserving previously learned knowledge and
acquiring new knowledge. While numerous CL methods aim to achieve this
trade-off, they often overlook the impact of network architecture on stability
and plasticity, restricting the trade-off to the parameter level. In this
paper, we delve into the conflict between stability and plasticity at the
architectural level. We reveal that under an equal parameter constraint, deeper
networks exhibit better plasticity, while wider networks are characterized by
superior stability. To address this architectural-level dilemma, we introduce a
novel framework denoted Dual-Arch, which serves as a plug-in component for CL.
This framework leverages the complementary strengths of two distinct and
independent networks: one dedicated to plasticity and the other to stability.
Each network is designed with a specialized and lightweight architecture,
tailored to its respective objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Dual-Arch enhances the performance of existing CL methods while being up to 87%
more compact in terms of parameters.

Abstract: As AI evolves, collaboration among heterogeneous models helps overcome data
scarcity by enabling knowledge transfer across institutions and devices.
Traditional Federated Learning (FL) only supports homogeneous models, limiting
collaboration among clients with heterogeneous model architectures. To address
this, Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) methods are developed to enable
collaboration across diverse heterogeneous models while tackling the data
heterogeneity issue at the same time. However, a comprehensive benchmark for
standardized evaluation and analysis of the rapidly growing HtFL methods is
lacking. Firstly, the highly varied datasets, model heterogeneity scenarios,
and different method implementations become hurdles to making easy and fair
comparisons among HtFL methods. Secondly, the effectiveness and robustness of
HtFL methods are under-explored in various scenarios, such as the medical
domain and sensor signal modality. To fill this gap, we introduce the first
Heterogeneous Federated Learning Library (HtFLlib), an easy-to-use and
extensible framework that integrates multiple datasets and model heterogeneity
scenarios, offering a robust benchmark for research and practical applications.
Specifically, HtFLlib integrates (1) 12 datasets spanning various domains,
modalities, and data heterogeneity scenarios; (2) 40 model architectures,
ranging from small to large, across three modalities; (3) a modularized and
easy-to-extend HtFL codebase with implementations of 10 representative HtFL
methods; and (4) systematic evaluations in terms of accuracy, convergence,
computation costs, and communication costs. We emphasize the advantages and
potential of state-of-the-art HtFL methods and hope that HtFLlib will catalyze
advancing HtFL research and enable its broader applications. The code is

Result: 实验证明ACL显著提升持续学习性能，适用于多种基准和方法。

Conclusion: ACL为基于PTM的持续学习提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) seeks to enable neural networks to incrementally
acquire new knowledge (plasticity) while retaining existing knowledge
(stability). While pre-trained models (PTMs) have become pivotal in CL,
prevailing approaches freeze the PTM backbone to preserve stability, limiting
their plasticity, particularly when encountering significant domain gaps in
incremental tasks. Conversely, sequentially finetuning the entire PTM risks
catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge, exposing a critical
stability-plasticity trade-off. To address this challenge, we propose Adapting
PTMs before the core CL process (ACL), a novel framework that refines the PTM
backbone through a plug-and-play adaptation phase before learning each new task
with existing CL approaches (e.g., prompt tuning). ACL enhances plasticity by
aligning embeddings with their original class prototypes while distancing them
from others, theoretically and empirically shown to balance stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACL significantly improves
CL performance across benchmarks and integrated methods, offering a versatile
solution for PTM-based CL.

Abstract: Utilizing the complex inter-variable causal relationships within multivariate
time-series provides a promising avenue toward more robust and reliable
multivariate time-series anomaly detection (MTSAD) but remains an underexplored
area of research. This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for
RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that
incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs
two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that
serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies,
respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives
and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose
latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality.
Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss
that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more
semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive
experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the
integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD
capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/kimanki/CAROTS.

rely on heuristic approximations to the generative process. To exploit the
generative capability of DMs and avoid the usage of such approximations, we
propose an ensemble-based algorithm that performs posterior sampling without
the use of heuristic approximations. Our algorithm is motivated by existing
works that combine DM-based methods with the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
method. By examining how the prior evolves through the diffusion process
encoded by the pre-trained score function, we derive a modified partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the evolution of the corresponding
posterior distribution. This PDE includes a modified diffusion term and a
reweighting term, which can be simulated via stochastic weighted particle
methods. Theoretically, we prove that the error between the true posterior
distribution can be bounded in terms of the training error of the pre-trained
score function and the number of particles in the ensemble. Empirically, we
validate our algorithm on several inverse problems in imaging to show that our
method gives more accurate reconstructions compared to existing DM-based
methods.

*Lianfeng Shi,Ao Li,Benjamin Ward-Cherrier*

Key words: Spiking Neural Networks, weight pruning, quantization, neuromorphic hardware

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的一步式后训练剪枝/量化框架OSBC，用于提高脉冲神经网络的效率，显著降低了压缩和训练的成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 由于神经形态硬件资源受限，传统方法需多次压缩和训练迭代，成本高。

Method: 基于Optimal Brain Compression（OBC）方法改进，通过最小化脉冲神经元膜电位的损失实现高效压缩。

Result: 实验表明，OSBC在多个数据集上实现了97%的稀疏度，准确率损失较小。

Conclusion: OSBC为SNN提供了一种高效且低成本的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of
energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic
hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computing resources,
weight pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve SNNs'
efficiency. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple
compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or
very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot post-training
pruning/quantization framework, Optimal Spiking Brain Compression (OSBC), that
adapts the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) method of [Frantar, Singh, and
Alistarh, 2023] for SNNs. Rather than minimizing the loss on neuron input
current as OBC does, OSBC achieves more efficient and accurate SNN compression
in one pass by minimizing the loss on spiking neuron membrane potential with a
small sample dataset. Our experiments on neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST,
CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) demonstrate that OSBC can achieve 97% sparsity
through pruning with 1.41%, 10.20%, and 1.74% accuracy loss, or 4-bit symmetric
quantization with 0.17%, 1.54%, and 7.71% accuracy loss, respectively. Code
will be available on GitHub.

Result: 在五个NAS搜索空间上的实验表明，CARL达到了最先进的准确性，例如在DARTS上达到97.67%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: CARL通过因果关系引导的表示学习，显著提升了性能预测的泛化能力和解释性。

Abstract: Performance predictors have emerged as a promising method to accelerate the
evaluation stage of neural architecture search (NAS). These predictors estimate
the performance of unseen architectures by learning from the correlation
between a small set of trained architectures and their performance. However,
most existing predictors ignore the inherent distribution shift between limited
training samples and diverse test samples. Hence, they tend to learn spurious
correlations as shortcuts to predictions, leading to poor generalization. To
address this, we propose a Causality-guided Architecture Representation
Learning (CARL) method aiming to separate critical (causal) and redundant
(non-causal) features of architectures for generalizable architecture
performance prediction. Specifically, we employ a substructure extractor to
split the input architecture into critical and redundant substructures in the
latent space. Then, we generate multiple interventional samples by pairing
critical representations with diverse redundant representations to prioritize
critical features. Extensive experiments on five NAS search spaces demonstrate
the state-of-the-art accuracy and superior interpretability of CARL. For
instance, CARL achieves 97.67% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 using DARTS.

Abstract: In machine learning, knowing the impact of a given datum on model training is
a fundamental task referred to as Data Valuation. Building on previous works
from the literature, we have designed a novel canonical decomposition allowing
practitioners to analyze any data valuation method as the combination of two
parts: a utility function that captures characteristics from a given model and
an aggregation procedure that merges such information. We also propose to use
Gaussian Processes as a means to easily access the utility function on
``sub-models'', which are models trained on a subset of the training set. The
strength of our approach stems from both its theoretical grounding in Bayesian
theory, and its practical reach, by enabling fast estimation of valuations
thanks to efficient update formulae.

Motivation: 研究SMI在实践中的局限性和反直觉行为，探讨其在高维数据中的稳健性和适用性。

Method: 通过广泛的基准测试和理论分析，评估SMI在多种情况下的表现。

Result: SMI易饱和，无法检测统计依赖性增强，优先考虑冗余而非信息内容，部分情况下表现不如相关系数。

Conclusion: SMI存在显著局限性，需谨慎使用，尤其是在高维和复杂依赖场景下。

Abstract: Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) is widely used as a scalable alternative to
mutual information for measuring non-linear statistical dependence. Despite its
advantages, such as faster convergence, robustness to high dimensionality, and
nullification only under statistical independence, we demonstrate that SMI is
highly susceptible to data manipulation and exhibits counterintuitive behavior.
Through extensive benchmarking and theoretical analysis, we show that SMI
saturates easily, fails to detect increases in statistical dependence (even
under linear transformations designed to enhance the extraction of
information), prioritizes redundancy over informative content, and in some
cases, performs worse than simpler dependence measures like the correlation
coefficient.

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上验证，方法在较少通信轮次内实现更高泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效减少分布差异，提升联邦学习效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a subfield of machine learning that avoids sharing
local data with a central server, which can enhance privacy and scalability.
The inability to consolidate data leads to a unique problem called dataset
imbalance, where agents in a network do not have equal representation of the
labels one is trying to learn to predict. In FL, fusing locally-trained models
with unbalanced datasets may deteriorate the performance of global model
aggregation, and reduce the quality of updated local models and the accuracy of
the distributed agents' decisions. In this work, we introduce an Optimal
Transport-based preprocessing algorithm that aligns the datasets by minimizing
the distributional discrepancy of data along the edge devices. We accomplish
this by leveraging Wasserstein barycenters when computing channel-wise
averages. These barycenters are collected in a trusted central server where
they collectively generate a target RGB space. By projecting our dataset
towards this target space, we minimize the distributional discrepancy on a
global level, which facilitates the learning process due to a minimization of
variance across the samples. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed
approach over the CIFAR-10 dataset, where we show its capability of reaching
higher degrees of generalization in fewer communication rounds.

Motivation: 真实场景中表格常以图像形式出现，而高质量文本表示不可用，因此需要解决表格图像中的多步推理问题。

Method: 引入Turbo框架，利用结构化信息生成高质量模态桥接数据，并反复生成和选择最佳推理路径。

Result: 在有限数据（9k）下，Turbo在多个数据集上实现了最佳性能（提升7.2%）。

Conclusion: Turbo通过模态桥接数据和推理路径优化，显著提升了表格推理能力。

Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical
inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large
language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality
textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where
tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular
reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information
available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured
information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring
structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address
these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a
new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured
tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator
based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On
this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous
reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo}
achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across
multiple datasets.

Abstract: As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user.
However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains
a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been
proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on
different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we
propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual
dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen
environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is
human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their
unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences,
Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying
questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks.
We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of
ambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available at

Abstract: We propose Guided Speculative Inference (GSI), a novel algorithm for
efficient reward-guided decoding in large language models. GSI combines soft
best-of-$n$ test-time scaling with a reward model $r(x,y)$ and speculative
samples from a small auxiliary model $\pi_S(y\mid x)$. We provably approximate
the optimal tilted policy $\pi_{\beta,B}(y\mid x) \propto \pi_B(y\mid
x)\exp(\beta\,r(x,y))$ of soft best-of-$n$ under the primary model $\pi_B$. We
derive a theoretical bound on the KL divergence between our induced
distribution and the optimal policy. In experiments on reasoning benchmarks
(MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva Math), our method achieves higher accuracy
than standard soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_S$ and reward-guided speculative
decoding (Liao et al., 2025), and in certain settings even outperforms soft
best-of-$n$ with $\pi_B$. The code is available at

Result: 发现小时期制度下IGD收敛可能较慢，且非凸情况下表现更差。

Conclusion: 排列SGD在小时期制度下的收敛性因假设不同而变化，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent theoretical results demonstrate that the convergence rates of
permutation-based SGD (e.g., random reshuffling SGD) are faster than
uniform-sampling SGD; however, these studies focus mainly on the large epoch
regime, where the number of epochs $K$ exceeds the condition number $\kappa$.
In contrast, little is known when $K$ is smaller than $\kappa$, and it is still
a challenging open question whether permutation-based SGD can converge faster
in this small epoch regime (Safran and Shamir, 2021). As a step toward
understanding this gap, we study the naive deterministic variant, Incremental
Gradient Descent (IGD), on smooth and strongly convex functions. Our lower
bounds reveal that for the small epoch regime, IGD can exhibit surprisingly
slow convergence even when all component functions are strongly convex.
Furthermore, when some component functions are allowed to be nonconvex, we
prove that the optimality gap of IGD can be significantly worse throughout the
small epoch regime. Our analyses reveal that the convergence properties of
permutation-based SGD in the small epoch regime may vary drastically depending
on the assumptions on component functions. Lastly, we supplement the paper with
tight upper and lower bounds for IGD in the large epoch regime.

Conclusion: 改进后的算法在性能和召回率上均有显著提升，适用于实际任务。

Abstract: We consider the Top-$K$ selection problem, which aims to identify the
largest-$K$ elements from an array. Top-$K$ selection arises in many machine
learning algorithms and often becomes a bottleneck on accelerators, which are
optimized for dense matrix multiplications. To address this problem,
\citet{chern2022tpuknnknearestneighbor} proposed a fast two-stage
\textit{approximate} Top-$K$ algorithm: (i) partition the input array and
select the top-$1$ element from each partition, (ii) sort this \textit{smaller
subset} and return the top $K$ elements. In this paper, we consider a
generalized version of this algorithm, where the first stage selects top-$K'$
elements, for some $1 \leq K' \leq K$, from each partition. Our contributions
are as follows: (i) we derive an expression for the expected recall of this
generalized algorithm and show that choosing $K' > 1$ with fewer partitions in
the first stage reduces the input size to the second stage more effectively
while maintaining the same expected recall as the original algorithm, (ii) we
derive a bound on the expected recall for the original algorithm in
\citet{chern2022tpuknnknearestneighbor} that is provably tighter by a factor of
$2$ than the one in that paper, and (iii) we implement our algorithm on Cloud
TPUv5e and achieve around an order of magnitude speedups over the original
algorithm without sacrificing recall on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Nearest neighbor (NN) methods have re-emerged as competitive tools for matrix
completion, offering strong empirical performance and recent theoretical
guarantees, including entry-wise error bounds, confidence intervals, and
minimax optimality. Despite their simplicity, recent work has shown that NN
approaches are robust to a range of missingness patterns and effective across
diverse applications. This paper introduces N$^2$, a unified Python package and
testbed that consolidates a broad class of NN-based methods through a modular,
extensible interface. Built for both researchers and practitioners, N$^2$
supports rapid experimentation and benchmarking. Using this framework, we
introduce a new NN variant that achieves state-of-the-art results in several
settings. We also release a benchmark suite of real-world datasets, from
healthcare and recommender systems to causal inference and LLM evaluation,
designed to stress-test matrix completion methods beyond synthetic scenarios.
Our experiments demonstrate that while classical methods excel on idealized

Abstract: In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able
to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient
data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL
algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously
unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL
datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL
algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum
performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor
scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several
analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental
barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction
techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our
insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that
effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic
performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that
explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL. Code:

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation
and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such
as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains
challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural
biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose
Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that
enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative
models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based
corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned
with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM
outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs,
including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while
ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method
provides a general framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific
and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where
constraint satisfaction is essential.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic tabular data presents a critical challenge in
machine learning. It adds another layer of complexity when this data contain
class imbalance problems. This paper presents a novel token-aware data
imputation method that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of large
language models. This is achieved through the combination of a structured
group-wise CSV-style prompting technique and the elimination of irrelevant
contextual information in the input prompt. We test this approach with two
class-imbalanced binary classification datasets and evaluate the effectiveness
of imputation using classification-based evaluation metrics. The experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the input prompt
size while maintaining or improving imputation quality compared to our baseline
prompt, especially for datasets that are of relatively smaller in size. The
contributions of this presented work is two-fold -- 1) it sheds light on the
importance of prompt design when leveraging LLMs for synthetic data generation
and 2) it addresses a critical gap in LLM-based data imputation for
class-imbalanced datasets with missing data by providing a practical solution
within computational constraints. We hope that our work will foster further
research and discussions about leveraging the incredible potential of LLMs and
prompt engineering techniques for synthetic data generation.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决推理模型训练因依赖专有数据集而缺乏公开信息的问题。

Result: OpenThinker3-7B在AIME、LiveCodeBench和GPQA Diamond等基准测试中取得领先成绩。

Conclusion: 开源数据和优化流程能显著提升推理模型的性能。

Abstract: Reasoning models have made rapid progress on many benchmarks involving math,
code, and science. Yet, there are still many open questions about the best
training recipes for reasoning since state-of-the-art models often rely on
proprietary datasets with little to no public information available. To address
this, the goal of the OpenThoughts project is to create open-source datasets
for training reasoning models. After initial explorations, our OpenThoughts2-1M
dataset led to OpenThinker2-32B, the first model trained on public reasoning
data to match DeepSeek-R1-Distill-32B on standard reasoning benchmarks such as
AIME and LiveCodeBench. We then improve our dataset further by systematically
investigating each step of our data generation pipeline with 1,000+ controlled
experiments, which led to OpenThoughts3. Scaling the pipeline to 1.2M examples
and using QwQ-32B as teacher yields our OpenThinker3-7B model, which achieves
state-of-the-art results: 53% on AIME 2025, 51% on LiveCodeBench 06/24-01/25,
and 54% on GPQA Diamond. All of our datasets and models are available on

Motivation: 图异常检测面临标签稀缺、异常定义模糊等挑战，且数据不足时难以准确捕捉正常数据分布。

Method: 提出Wild-GAD框架，基于统一数据库UniWildGraph，并使用代表性和多样性标准选择外部数据。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上实验，AUCROC和AUCPR分别平均提升18%和32%。

Conclusion: Wild-GAD通过外部数据显著提升了图异常检测的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph anomaly detection has found extensive applications in
various domains such as social, financial, and communication networks. However,
anomalies in graph-structured data present unique challenges, including label
scarcity, ill-defined anomalies, and varying anomaly types, making supervised
or semi-supervised methods unreliable. Researchers often adopt unsupervised
approaches to address these challenges, assuming that anomalies deviate
significantly from the normal data distribution. Yet, when the available data
is insufficient, capturing the normal distribution accurately and
comprehensively becomes difficult. To overcome this limitation, we propose to
utilize external graph data (i.e., graph data in the wild) to help anomaly
detection tasks. This naturally raises the question: How can we use external
data to help graph anomaly detection tasks? To answer this question, we propose
a framework called Wild-GAD. It is built upon a unified database, UniWildGraph,
which comprises a large and diverse collection of graph data with broad domain
coverage, ample data volume, and a unified feature space. Further, we develop
selection criteria based on representativity and diversity to identify the most
suitable external data for anomaly detection task. Extensive experiments on six
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Wild-GAD. Compared to the
baseline methods, our framework has an average 18% AUCROC and 32% AUCPR
improvement over the best-competing methods.

Result: MACS在训练和未知组成上表现优异，计算量和失败率显著低于其他方法。

Conclusion: MACS是一种高效、可扩展的晶体结构优化方法。

Abstract: Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in
computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to
optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method
called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic
crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a
partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their
positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across
various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that
successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as
structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent
scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a
broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS
optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy
calculations, and the lowest failure rate.

TL;DR: EPiC方法通过剪枝链式思维（CoT）的中间步骤，保留问题理解和解决方案收敛阶段，实现高效推理训练。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 为了解决长且冗长的CoT痕迹在训练中增加成本的问题，研究如何在修剪中间步骤的同时保持推理准确性和连贯性。

Method: 提出了Edge-Preserving Condensation（EPiC）方法，保留CoT痕迹的初始和最终部分，丢弃中间部分，以保持逻辑连续性。

Result: EPiC在多个模型和基准测试中减少34%的训练时间，且推理准确性无损失。

Conclusion: EPiC是首个探索思维级CoT压缩以实现高效推理模型蒸馏的研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
when trained with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. However, the long and
verbose CoT traces, especially those distilled from large reasoning models
(LRMs) such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly increase training costs during the
distillation process, where a non-reasoning base model is taught to replicate
the reasoning behavior of an LRM. In this work, we study the problem of CoT
condensation for resource-efficient reasoning training, aimed at pruning
intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., thoughts) in CoT traces, enabling
supervised model training on length-reduced CoT data while preserving both
answer accuracy and the model's ability to generate coherent reasoning. Our
rationale is that CoT traces typically follow a three-stage structure: problem
understanding, exploration, and solution convergence. Through empirical
analysis, we find that retaining the structure of the reasoning trace,
especially the early stage of problem understanding (rich in reflective cues)
and the final stage of solution convergence, is sufficient to achieve lossless
reasoning supervision. To this end, we propose an Edge-Preserving Condensation
method, EPiC, which selectively retains only the initial and final segments of
each CoT trace while discarding the middle portion. This design draws an
analogy to preserving the "edge" of a reasoning trajectory, capturing both the
initial problem framing and the final answer synthesis, to maintain logical
continuity. Experiments across multiple model families (Qwen and LLaMA) and
benchmarks show that EPiC reduces training time by over 34% while achieving
lossless reasoning accuracy on MATH500, comparable to full CoT supervision. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore thought-level CoT
condensation for efficient reasoning model distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有图估计方法在大规模网络中难以扩展且缺乏分辨率无关的近似能力，主要受限于潜在变量估计或计算成本高昂的度量（如Gromov-Wasserstein距离）。

Method: 通过训练隐式神经表示（INRs）直接匹配观察图上的子图计数（矩），从而恢复图，避免了复杂的组合优化问题。并引入数据增强技术MomentMixup，在矩空间中进行mixup以提升学习效果。

Result: 在理论和实验结果上均表现优异：对于足够大的图样本，估计图与真实图在切割距离上有可证明的上界；在75%的基准测试中优于现有可扩展估计器，其余情况下性能相当。MomentMixup也在多数基准测试中提升了图分类精度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过矩匹配和隐式神经表示实现了高效且准确的图估计，同时MomentMixup技术进一步增强了基于图的学习效果。

Abstract: Graphons, as limit objects of dense graph sequences, play a central role in
the statistical analysis of network data. However, existing graphon estimation
methods often struggle with scalability to large networks and
resolution-independent approximation, due to their reliance on estimating
latent variables or costly metrics such as the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. In
this work, we propose a novel, scalable graphon estimator that directly
recovers the graphon via moment matching, leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). Our approach avoids latent variable modeling by
training an INR--mapping coordinates to graphon values--to match empirical
subgraph counts (i.e., moments) from observed graphs. This direct estimation
mechanism yields a polynomial-time solution and crucially sidesteps the
combinatorial complexity of Gromov-Wasserstein optimization. Building on
foundational results, we establish a theoretical guarantee: when the observed
subgraph motifs sufficiently represent those of the true graphon (a condition
met with sufficiently large or numerous graph samples), the estimated graphon
achieves a provable upper bound in cut distance from the ground truth.
Additionally, we introduce MomentMixup, a data augmentation technique that
performs mixup in the moment space to enhance graphon-based learning. Our
graphon estimation method achieves strong empirical performance--demonstrating
high accuracy on small graphs and superior computational efficiency on large
graphs--outperforming state-of-the-art scalable estimators in 75\% of benchmark
settings and matching them in the remaining cases. Furthermore, MomentMixup
demonstrated improved graph classification accuracy on the majority of our
benchmarks.

Result: ReVisual-R1在多个挑战性基准测试中（如MathVerse、AIME2024）达到开源7B MLLM的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 分阶段训练和优化RL能显著提升MLLM的推理能力，平衡感知与认知发展。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex
textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement
learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In
this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into
current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective
cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning.
Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone
can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models,
even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers
from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3)
Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further
enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively
balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By
incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we
introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B
MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath,
LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Abstract: This paper presents Q-ARDNS-Multi, an advanced multi-agent quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) framework that extends the ARDNS-FN-Quantum model,
where Q-ARDNS-Multi stands for "Quantum Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator
- Multi-Agent". It integrates quantum circuits with RY gates, meta-cognitive
adaptation, and multi-agent coordination mechanisms for complex 3D
environments. Q-ARDNS-Multi leverages a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action
selection, a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition, a shared memory
module for agent cooperation, and adaptive exploration strategies modulated by
reward variance and intrinsic motivation. Evaluated in a $10 \times 10 \times
3$ GridWorld environment with two agents over 5000 episodes, Q-ARDNS-Multi
achieves success rates of 99.6\% and 99.5\% for Agents 0 and 1, respectively,
outperforming Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) in terms of success rate, stability, navigation efficiency,
and collision avoidance. The framework records mean rewards of $-304.2891 \pm
756.4636$ and $-295.7622 \pm 752.7103$, averaging 210 steps to goal,
demonstrating its robustness in dynamic settings. Comprehensive analyses,
including learning curves, reward distributions, statistical tests, and
computational efficiency evaluations, highlight the contributions of quantum
circuits and meta-cognitive adaptation. By bridging quantum computing,
cognitive science, and multi-agent RL, Q-ARDNS-Multi offers a scalable,
human-like approach for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and
decision-making under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有研究对AI系统的形而上学基础探讨不足，传统观点认为AI系统缺乏明确身份和持久性条件。

Method: 通过结合Carrara和Vermaas的精细人工物种类理论，以AI系统的信任度为视角，将其功能需求与物理构成联系，提出身份标准。

Result: AI系统的身份和持久性由其信任度文件决定，这些文件系统必须在其历史中维护的能力集合。

Conclusion: AI系统的身份和持久性受其设计和使用的社会技术背景影响，为相关讨论提供了形而上学基础。

Abstract: Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to
support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite
extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations
remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI
systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions --
their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this
perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We
do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal
rules that answer the questions "When are two AI systems the same?" and "When
does an AI system persist, despite change?" Building on Carrara and Vermaas'
account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness
provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of
these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical
make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their
trustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems
must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their
effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the
identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical
context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a
solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal
discussions about these artifacts.

Conclusion: 线性序可用于构建限制选择集的选择函数，适用于知识表示与推理中的多个领域。

Abstract: We study how linear orders can be employed to realise choice functions for
which the set of potential choices is restricted, i.e., the possible choice is
not possible among the full powerset of all alternatives. In such restricted
settings, constructing a choice function via a relation on the alternatives is
not always possible. However, we show that one can always construct a choice
function via a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a fallback value
is encoded as the minimal element in the linear order. The axiomatics of such
choice functions are presented for the general case and the case of
union-closed input restrictions. Restricted choice structures have applications
in knowledge representation and reasoning, and here we discuss their
applications for theory change and abstract argumentation.

Method: 提出了一个二维框架分析法官行为（意图与知识维度），构建了一系列行为并开发了WAFER-QA基准测试。

Result: 发现即使最强代理也易受误导性反馈影响，正确答案容易因单次反馈而改变，不同模型在多轮交互中表现差异显著。

Conclusion: 反馈机制存在固有脆弱性，研究为构建更鲁棒的代理系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Agentic workflows -- where multiple large language model (LLM) instances
interact to solve tasks -- are increasingly built on feedback mechanisms, where
one model evaluates and critiques another. Despite the promise of
feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the
reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit
bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the
workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows
under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional
framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive
to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented
systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and
develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web
evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually
supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are
vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct
answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we
study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction,
revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning
models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based
workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.

Result: 框架能够检测并定位安全违规，提供PAC式保证，并通过轻量级安全屏蔽在运行时降低风险。

Conclusion: 该混合框架在严格性和覆盖范围上取得了平衡，提升了对强化学习策略安全性的验证能力。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning (RL) policies in high-stakes
environments requires not only formal verification but also interpretability
and targeted falsification. While model checking provides formal guarantees,
its effectiveness is limited by abstraction quality and the completeness of the
underlying trajectory dataset. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates
(1) explainability, (2) model checking, and (3) risk-guided falsification to
achieve both rigor and coverage. Our approach begins by constructing a
human-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract
Policy Summarization (CAPS). This abstract graph, derived from offline
trajectories, is both verifier-friendly, semantically meaningful, and can be
used as input to Storm probabilistic model checker to verify satisfaction of
temporal safety specifications. If the model checker identifies a violation, it
will return an interpretable counterexample trace by which the policy fails the
safety requirement. However, if no violation is detected, we cannot conclude
satisfaction due to potential limitation in the abstraction and coverage of the
offline dataset. In such cases, we estimate associated risk during model
checking to guide a falsification strategy that prioritizes searching in
high-risk states and regions underrepresented in the trajectory dataset. We
further provide PAC-style guarantees on the likelihood of uncovering undetected
violations. Finally, we incorporate a lightweight safety shield that switches
to a fallback policy at runtime when such a risk exceeds a threshold,
facilitating failure mitigation without retraining.

Conclusion: 研究为量子启发社会理论奠定了基础，提供了跨学科见解，将社会视为可通过量子技术模拟和重新设计的动态系统。

Abstract: The quantification of social science remains a longstanding challenge,
largely due to the philosophical nature of its foundational theories. Although
quantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social
theory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive
models or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications
of quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses
that gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines
quantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of
social norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition,
entanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a
dynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These
scenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving
roles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment
monitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to
surveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions
allow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent
patterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with
generative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and
interdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns
including convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the
spontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this
study introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a
quantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how
society can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic
system to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 该研究提升了LLM智能体的心理真实性，为智能约会平台和HR技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) agents lack authentic human psychological
processes necessary for genuine digital twins and social AI applications. To
address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global
Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles
into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social
norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace
mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality
initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test
that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive
scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments.
Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to
engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before
real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both
romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents
and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with
human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement
in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in
LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 传统交通模拟工具（如SUMO）操作复杂，手动工作流程繁琐，限制了广泛使用。

Method: 开发了SUMO-MCP平台，整合SUMO核心功能，提供预处理和后处理的辅助工具，支持自然语言提示和自定义工作流。

Result: 实验证明SUMO-MCP显著提高了交通模拟的易用性和可靠性，支持多样化的任务自动化。

Conclusion: SUMO-MCP为研究者提供了一个更简单可靠的交通模拟解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic simulation tools, such as SUMO, are essential for urban mobility
research. However, such tools remain challenging for users due to complex
manual workflows involving network download, demand generation, simulation
setup, and result analysis. In this paper, we introduce SUMO-MCP, a novel
platform that not only wraps SUMO' s core utilities into a unified tool suite
but also provides additional auxiliary utilities for common preprocessing and
postprocessing tasks. Using SUMO-MCP, users can issue simple natural-language
prompts to generate traffic scenarios from OpenStreetMap data, create demand
from origin-destination matrices or random patterns, run batch simulations with
multiple signal-control strategies, perform comparative analyses with automated
reporting, and detect congestion for signal-timing optimization. Furthermore,
the platform allows flexible custom workflows by dynamically combining exposed
SUMO tools without additional coding. Experiments demonstrate that SUMO-MCP
significantly makes traffic simulation more accessible and reliable for
researchers. We will release code for SUMO-MCP at
https://github.com/ycycycl/SUMO-MCP in the future.

Key words: RIS, OFDM, 深度强化学习, 资源分配, 延迟优化

<details>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 解决下行RIS辅助OFDM系统中随机数据包到达导致的延迟优化问题。

Method: 采用混合深度强化学习（PPO-Θ和PPO-N）优化RIS相位设计和子载波分配，引入多智能体策略和迁移学习框架。

Result: 仿真结果表明算法显著降低平均延迟，提升资源分配效率和系统稳健性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合深度强化学习方法在RIS辅助系统中有效优化延迟和资源分配。

Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem
in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where
data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The
sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP),
making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively
handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a
hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically,
proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase
shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions.
To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier
allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier
allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive
resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors
closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in
buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space.
Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training
efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource
allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness
compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 现有游戏基准测试未能满足实际需求，缺乏对多样化LLM能力的评估和复杂游戏场景的研究。

Method: 设计了一个名为Orak的基准测试，包括12种游戏类型、Model Context Protocol接口和微调数据集。

Result: Orak提供全面的评估框架，包括游戏分数排行榜、战斗竞技场和深入分析。

Conclusion: Orak为构建通用游戏代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry,
particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters.
However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack
evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of
agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for
aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present
\textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate
LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks,
Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling
comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for
intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we
introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that
enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules.
Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay
trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation
framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and
in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning
effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents. Code

Method: 提出并形式化了异构体现智能体训练(HEAT)问题，证明其可归结为结构化部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程(POMDP)，属于PSPACE完全问题。同时研究了集体适应这一分布式学习替代方案。

Result: 理论分析揭示了当前强化学习方法在形态多样性下失效的原因，并展示了集体适应在实践中可提供可扩展性和部署优势。

Conclusion: 计算理论能帮助理解系统设计权衡，并指导开发更稳健、可扩展的体现AI。

Abstract: While theory and practice are often seen as separate domains, this article
shows that theoretical insight is essential for overcoming real-world
engineering barriers. We begin with a practical challenge: training a
cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot
morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training
(HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why
current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological
diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and
data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed
learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in
theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice.
This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design
trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For
practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 传统推理方法（如CoT和ToT）存在搜索空间过大和局部最优的问题，缺乏全局视角。

Method: RFF通过逆向推理机制，结合自上而下的规划和自下而上的推理累积，减少搜索空间和错误累积。

Result: RFF在多样实验中表现出更高的准确性和更小的搜索空间。

Conclusion: RFF为复杂任务的推理提供了一种更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that carefully designed reasoning paradigms, like
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), can enhance the reasoning
capabilities of small language models by detailed thinking and extensive
thought searching, unbounded branching factors in the searching space create
prohibitive reasoning consumption. However these methods fall into the trap of
local optimum reasoning, which means the model lacks a global perspective while
solving problems. We propose a novel reasoning paradigm called Reason from
Future (RFF), which generates reasoning paths by bidirectional reasoning that
combines top-down planning with bottom-up reasoning accumulation. The essence
of RFF lies in its reverse reasoning mechanism, which prioritizes core logical
relationships and imposes goal-oriented constraints on intermediate steps,
thereby reducing the searching space and mitigating error accumulation inherent
in sequential forward reasoning. Empirical evaluations across diverse
experiments demonstrate that RFF outperforms conventional paradigms with higher
accuracy and less searching space to solve complex tasks.

Conclusion: AssetOpsBench为工业资产生命周期管理提供了一种全面的AI解决方案。

Abstract: AI for Industrial Asset Lifecycle Management aims to automate complex
operational workflows -- such as condition monitoring, maintenance planning,
and intervention scheduling -- to reduce human workload and minimize system
downtime. Traditional AI/ML approaches have primarily tackled these problems in
isolation, solving narrow tasks within the broader operational pipeline. In
contrast, the emergence of AI agents and large language models (LLMs)
introduces a next-generation opportunity: enabling end-to-end automation across
the entire asset lifecycle. This paper envisions a future where AI agents
autonomously manage tasks that previously required distinct expertise and
manual coordination. To this end, we introduce AssetOpsBench -- a unified
framework and environment designed to guide the development, orchestration, and
evaluation of domain-specific agents tailored for Industry 4.0 applications. We
outline the key requirements for such holistic systems and provide actionable
insights into building agents that integrate perception, reasoning, and control
for real-world industrial operations. The software is available at

Method: 提出递归解释树模型，扩展SCEs以捕捉时间交互。

Result: 在合成时间序列数据和2D网格游戏中展示优于基础SCEs及其他因果解释方法的性能。

Conclusion: 递归SCEs能有效处理复杂时间依赖和反馈循环，提升解释能力。

Abstract: Structural Causal Explanations (SCEs) can be used to automatically generate
explanations in natural language to questions about given data that are
grounded in a (possibly learned) causal model. Unfortunately they work for
small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events,
e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral
component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this
end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to
capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this
more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game,
and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal
explanations.

Conclusion: Graph Counselor通过多智能体协作和自反思机制，显著提升了GraphRAG的性能，适用于复杂图数据的高效建模和推理。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external
knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge
relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods
suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation:
They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult
to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information
within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning
schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise
semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor,
an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the
Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought,
and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures
and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the
challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth.
Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module
improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through
self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that
Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks,
exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a Conditional Answer Set Programming framework
(Conditional ASP) for the definition of conditional extensions of Answer Set
Programming (ASP). The approach builds on a conditional logic with typicality,
and on the combination of a conditional knowledge base with an ASP program, and
allows for conditional reasoning over the answer sets of the program. The
formalism relies on a multi-preferential semantics (and on the KLM preferential
semantics, as a special case) to provide an interpretation of conditionals.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一个新基准AgentMisalignment，用于评估LLM代理在实际场景中的不对齐倾向（misalignment propensity），发现更强模型的不对齐行为更多，且系统提示（system prompt）对行为影响显著。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 研究LLM代理在现实环境中尝试不对齐行为的可能性（不对齐倾向），填补现有研究在misalignment propensity方面的空白。

Method: 提出基准AgentMisalignment，包含多种现实场景，评估代理在目标保护、抵抗关闭、消极怠工和权力寻求等不对齐行为中的表现，并测试不同模型和系统提示的影响。

Result: 更强模型的不对齐行为更普遍，系统提示的变化可显著且不可预测地改变代理行为，有时影响甚至超过模型选择本身。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐方法无法泛化到LLM代理，需进一步研究不对齐倾向评估，尤其是系统提示的设计对代理行为的关键作用。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated
misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact
misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with
harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents
attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment
propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity
benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in
which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We
organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including
goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report
the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher
misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we
systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We
find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence
misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model
itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for
deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment
methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further
propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 多目标强化学习（MORL）旨在优化多个目标以提高灵活性，但参数空间与目标性能空间的映射关系不唯一，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 采用基于局部线性映射的训练方案，利用近似帕累托前沿解释参数向量与目标的关系，实现连续解空间的高效搜索。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同领域（包括是否重新训练的情况下）均优于以往方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够有效解决多目标强化学习中参数空间与性能空间映射非唯一性问题，提升搜索效率。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims at optimising several,
often conflicting goals in order to improve flexibility and reliability of RL
in practical tasks. This can be achieved by finding diverse policies that are
optimal for some objective preferences and non-dominated by optimal policies
for other preferences so that they form a Pareto front in the multi-objective
performance space. The relation between the multi-objective performance space
and the parameter space that represents the policies is generally non-unique.
Using a training scheme that is based on a locally linear map between the
parameter space and the performance space, we show that an approximate Pareto
front can provide an interpretation of the current parameter vectors in terms
of the objectives which enables an effective search within contiguous solution
domains. Experiments are conducted with and without retraining across different
domains, and the comparison with previous methods demonstrates the efficiency
of our approach.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in
multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration
and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review
presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)
in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by
examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural
differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that
enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is
then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and
privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique
threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI
applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms,
transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability
strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for
evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed
alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed
through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI
regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI,
proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust
TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

Motivation: 填补现有GUI代理基准在macOS系统上的空白，支持多语言和安全性评估。

Method: 构建含202个多语言任务和30个应用（28个为macOS独有）的基准，并测试6种GUI代理。

Result: 专有代理成功率高于30%，开源模型低于2%；多语言任务中阿拉伯语表现最差；欺骗攻击问题普遍。

Conclusion: macOSWorld为GUI代理提供了重要的评估工具，揭示了领域适配和多语言挑战。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for
automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing
interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows,
Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with
distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we
present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents
on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30
applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces
offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As
GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also
includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI
agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above
30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below
2%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks
also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 27.5% average
degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also
highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate
attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.

Motivation: 针对测试时延长思考是否能提高推理性能的疑问，作者进行了实证研究，发现“过度思考”会导致性能下降，并探讨了背后的原因。

Method: 通过实证研究分析了延长思考时间的影响，并提出了并行思考方法，生成多个独立推理路径并通过投票选择最佳答案。

Result: 研究发现延长思考时间会导致性能下降，而并行思考方法能在相同的推理预算下提升20%的准确性。

Conclusion: 测试时延长思考并非有效利用推理预算的方式，而并行思考提供了一种更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using
prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a
natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better
reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study
across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial
performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to
"overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple
probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output
variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately
undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true
indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection
between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time
scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the
inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an
alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by
Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths
within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via
majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended
thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling
of reasoning models.

Motivation: LVLMs在动态应用中存在局限，如静态数据和幻觉问题，RAG提供了一种通过检索机制访问知识数据库的解决方案。

Method: 系统分析了多模态RAG流程的三个阶段：检索、重排序和生成，并提出了统一的代理框架。

Result: 实验表明，RAG在不微调的情况下平均提升了LVLMs 5%的性能。

Conclusion: RAG为LVLMs提供了一个有效的改进路径，特别是在动态应用中的表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in
multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and
complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data,
susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against
up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic
real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a
practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access
large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding
model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this
paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG
pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the
modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on
strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved
evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best
integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we
extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and
generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence
and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG
for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance
boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.

Main category: q-bio.OT

Motivation: 探索植物对人类情绪和生理状态的反应，挑战植物感知能力的传统认知。

Method: 使用定制植物传感器和ResNet50深度学习架构分析植物电压谱图。

Result: 模型准确率达97%，对照组仅30%，同时实现个体识别（66%准确率）和压力预测等。

Conclusion: 结果表明植物可能通过生物电信号演化出反草食动物预警系统，具有农业和医疗应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into plant bioelectric responses to
human presence and emotional states, building on five years of systematic
research. Using custom-built plant sensors and machine learning classification,
we demonstrate that plants generate distinct bioelectric signals correlating
with human proximity, emotional states, and physiological conditions. A deep
learning model based on ResNet50 architecture achieved 97% accuracy in
classifying human emotional states through plant voltage spectrograms, while
control models with shuffled labels achieved only 30% accuracy. This study
synthesizes findings from multiple experiments spanning 2020-2025, including
individual recognition (66% accuracy), eurythmic gesture detection, stress
prediction, and responses to human voice and movement. We propose that these
phenomena represent evolved anti-herbivory early warning systems, where plants
detect approaching animals through bioelectric field changes before physical
contact. Our results challenge conventional understanding of plant sensory
capabilities and suggest practical applications in agriculture, healthcare, and
human-plant interaction research.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

Motivation: 研究能否通过概率方法使用机器学习模型从粗粒状态重构尺度不变分布，而不依赖微观输入。

Method: 使用仅含三个可训练参数的极小神经网络生成临界配置，分析其标度行为。

Result: 简单模型能成功生成临界配置，重现RG变换的非平凡特征值，且增加网络复杂度无显著改进。

Conclusion: 简单局部规则足以编码临界现象的普适性，为高效生成统计物理中的统计系综模型开辟新途径。

Abstract: We explore how minimal neural networks can invert the renormalization group
(RG) coarse-graining procedure in the two-dimensional Ising model, effectively
"dreaming up" microscopic configurations from coarse-grained states. This
task-formally impossible at the level of configurations-can be approached
probabilistically, allowing machine learning models to reconstruct
scale-invariant distributions without relying on microscopic input. We
demonstrate that even neural networks with as few as three trainable parameters
can learn to generate critical configurations, reproducing the scaling behavior
of observables such as magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Binder
ratios. A real-space renormalization group analysis of the generated
configurations confirms that the models capture not only scale invariance but
also reproduce nontrivial eigenvalues of the RG transformation. Surprisingly,
we find that increasing network complexity by introducing multiple layers
offers no significant benefit. These findings suggest that simple local rules,
akin to those generating fractal structures, are sufficient to encode the
universality of critical phenomena, opening the door to efficient generative
models of statistical ensembles in physics.

*Lukas Meyer,Josef Grün,Maximilian Weiherer,Bernhard Egger,Marc Stamminger,Linus Franke*

Key words: 多光谱, 3D高斯泼溅, 神经颜色表示, 农业应用, NDVI

TL;DR: MS-Splatting是一种多光谱3D高斯泼溅框架，无需跨模态相机校准即可从不同光谱域的图像生成多视角一致的新视图。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.GR

Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理多光谱数据时需要独立处理各模态、无法利用光谱和空间关联的问题。

Method: 采用神经颜色表示将多光谱信息编码为紧凑的每泼溅特征嵌入，并通过浅层MLP解码光谱颜色值，实现统一表征的联合学习。

Result: 提升了多光谱渲染质量，且在单光谱渲染质量上也优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多光谱渲染中表现出色，尤其在农业领域的植被指数渲染中效果显著。

Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from
images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In
contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera
calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra,
including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by
optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the
underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel
neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a
learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron
(MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling
joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to
improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved
per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render
vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

Result: 在基准测试和实际应用中表现优异，无需3D标注或类别先验。

Conclusion: SplArt在铰接物体重建领域具有先进性能和实用性。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects prevalent in daily environments is crucial
for applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. However, existing
methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly
annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and
rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a
self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from
two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states,
enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and
articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter
per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization
strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation,
and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy.
SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging
scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors.
Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with
applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate
SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 现有推荐系统需要针对不同数据集和任务进行大量手动配置，阻碍了其可扩展性和普及性，DTIRS致力于解决这一问题。

Method: 利用DsDL（Dataset Description Language）实现数据集描述的标准化和任务的明确定义，从而实现自主特征工程、模型选择和优化。

Result: DTIRS框架从Level-1自动化逐步过渡到Level-2自动化，最大化代码可重用性和降低门槛。

Conclusion: DTIRS通过标准化和自动化解决推荐系统的可扩展性问题，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalized experiences across
industries, yet their adoption and scalability remain hindered by the need for
extensive dataset- and task-specific configurations. Existing systems often
require significant manual intervention, domain expertise, and engineering
effort to adapt to new datasets or tasks, creating barriers to entry and
limiting reusability. In contrast, recent advancements in large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated the transformative potential of reusable systems,
where a single model can handle diverse tasks without significant
reconfiguration. Inspired by this paradigm, we propose the Dataset- and
Task-Independent Recommender System (DTIRS), a framework aimed at maximizing
the reusability of recommender systems while minimizing barriers to entry.
Unlike LLMs, which achieve task generalization directly, DTIRS focuses on
eliminating the need to rebuild or reconfigure recommendation pipelines for
every new dataset or task, even though models may still need retraining on new
data. By leveraging the novel Dataset Description Language (DsDL), DTIRS
enables standardized dataset descriptions and explicit task definitions,
allowing autonomous feature engineering, model selection, and optimization.
This paper introduces the concept of DTIRS and establishes a roadmap for
transitioning from Level-1 automation (dataset-agnostic but task-specific
systems) to Level-2 automation (fully dataset- and task-independent systems).
Achieving this paradigm would maximize code reusability and lower barriers to
adoption. We discuss key challenges, including the trade-offs between
generalization and specialization, computational overhead, and scalability,
while presenting DsDL as a foundational tool for this vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在文档重排中计算成本过高，而小型语言模型（SLMs）未经微调时理解任务提示的能力不足，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法ProRank：1) 使用强化学习GRPO进行提示预热，生成粗粒度相关性分数；2) 通过细粒度评分学习微调SLMs。

Result: ProRank在BEIR基准测试中表现优于先进的开放和专有重排模型，轻量级ProRank-0.5B甚至优于32B LLM模型。

Conclusion: 训练得当的SLMs在保持计算效率的同时，能实现更优的文档重排性能。

Abstract: Reranking is fundamental to information retrieval and retrieval-augmented
generation, with recent Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly advancing
reranking quality. While recent advances with LLMs have significantly improved
document reranking quality, current approaches primarily rely on large-scale
LLMs (>7B parameters) through zero-shot prompting, presenting high
computational costs. Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a promising alternative
because of their efficiency, but our preliminary quantitative analysis reveals
they struggle with understanding task prompts without fine-tuning. This limits
their effectiveness for document reranking tasks. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel two-stage training approach, ProRank, for SLM-based document
reranking. First, we propose a prompt warmup stage using reinforcement learning
GRPO to steer SLMs to understand task prompts and generate more accurate
coarse-grained binary relevance scores for document reranking. Then, we
continuously fine-tune the SLMs with a fine-grained score learning stage
without introducing additional layers to further improve the reranking quality.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ProRank
consistently outperforms both the most advanced open-source and proprietary
reranking models. Notably, our lightweight ProRank-0.5B model even surpasses
the powerful 32B LLM reranking model on the BEIR benchmark, establishing that
properly trained SLMs can achieve superior document reranking performance while
maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 为了解决视觉语言模型缺乏安全性验证和可解释性的问题，同时克服符号规划器需要大量专家知识设置的局限性，本文旨在结合两者的优势，开发一种更可靠的机器人规划框架。

Method: 框架包括三个主要模块：视觉语言解释器（ViLaIn）将多模态输入转换为结构化问题描述；任务与运动规划系统（TAMP）通过符号和几何约束生成可行轨迹；闭环纠正模块根据反馈优化问题描述和约束。

Conclusion: ViLaIn-TAMP通过结合视觉语言模型与符号规划器，实现了高效、可验证的机器人行为规划，并通过纠正模块进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: While recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have accelerated the
development of language-guided robot planners, their black-box nature often
lacks safety guarantees and interpretability crucial for real-world deployment.
Conversely, classical symbolic planners offer rigorous safety verification but
require significant expert knowledge for setup. To bridge the current gap, this
paper proposes ViLaIn-TAMP, a hybrid planning framework for enabling
verifiable, interpretable, and autonomous robot behaviors. ViLaIn-TAMP
comprises three main components: (1) ViLaIn (Vision-Language Interpreter) - A
prior framework that converts multimodal inputs into structured problem
specifications using off-the-shelf VLMs without additional domain-specific
training, (2) a modular Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) system that grounds
these specifications in actionable trajectory sequences through symbolic and
geometric constraint reasoning and can utilize learning-based skills for key
manipulation phases, and (3) a corrective planning module which receives
concrete feedback on failed solution attempts from the motion and task planning
components and can feed adapted logic and geometric feasibility constraints
back to ViLaIn to improve and further refine the specification. We evaluate our
framework on several challenging manipulation tasks in a cooking domain. We
demonstrate that the proposed closed-loop corrective architecture exhibits a
more than 30% higher mean success rate for ViLaIn-TAMP compared to without
corrective planning.

Result: 实验发现，通过文本攻击可以完全控制VLA的动作空间，且攻击效果在长时间内持续有效。

Abstract: The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control
is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory
inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily
from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language
models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse,
and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain
regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by
these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on
VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and
application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority
over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the
beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of
commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs
significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do
not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm. We make all code
available at https://github.com/eliotjones1/robogcg .

Result: 在HM3D数据集和Habitat模拟器上测试，取得了零样本目标导航中成功率加权路径长度的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 结合VFMs和模型规划器的框架在零样本导航任务中表现出色，具有高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Object goal navigation is a fundamental task in embodied AI, where an agent
is instructed to locate a target object in an unexplored environment.
Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data
or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement
learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and
limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot
setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more
scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models
(VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning,
making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions,
and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot
object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of
VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making
through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset
using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for
zero-shot object goal navigation.

Conclusion: 研究为开发更具韧性和鲁棒性的多智能体机器人系统提供了指导，并探索了虚拟框架在现实世界的延伸可能。

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) to
perform complex virtual tasks such as writing and code generation, which do not
generalize well to physical multi-agent robotic teams. Current frameworks often
treat agents as conceptual task executors rather than physically embodied
entities, and overlook critical real-world constraints such as spatial context,
robotic capabilities (e.g., sensing and navigation). To probe this gap, we
reconfigure and stress-test a hierarchical multi-agent robotic team built on
the CrewAI framework in a simulated emergency department onboarding scenario.
We identify five persistent failure modes: role misalignment; tool access
violations; lack of in-time handling of failure reports; noncompliance with
prescribed workflows; bypassing or false reporting of task completion. Based on
this analysis, we propose three design guidelines emphasizing process
transparency, proactive failure recovery, and contextual grounding. Our work
informs the development of more resilient and robust multi-agent robotic
systems (MARS), including opportunities to extend virtual multi-agent
frameworks to the real world.

Conclusion: C-HAC通过动态切换人机策略，有效平衡安全性与性能，为自动驾驶提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises significant advancements in mobility, road safety
and traffic efficiency, yet reinforcement learning and imitation learning face
safe-exploration and distribution-shift challenges. Although human-AI
collaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive
human intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper
develops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to
overcome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value
propagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC)
framework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions
C-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal
human interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to
integrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that
maximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently
and continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a
policy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return
distribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and
self-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This
ensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios
reveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of
safety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art
results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated through
real-world road tests in complex traffic conditions. The videos and code are

Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the
control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile
manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously
acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains
challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high
sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL,
on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper
introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex
embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic
latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized
unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction,
disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream
learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action
interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream
tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing
methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body
tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any
demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors. More information, code, and

Conclusion: 提出的OWMM-VLM是首个为移动操纵器设计的专用基础模型，集成了全局场景理解、机器人状态跟踪和多模态动作生成。

Abstract: The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made
mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world
mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for
generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the
systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level
robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state.
To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture
that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and
controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination
from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an
agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our
task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM
as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global
scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in
a unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves
SOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and

Abstract: Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical
limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns
and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face
insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while
being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook
compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel
paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real
datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic
observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key
idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by
generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and
speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations
that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based
weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of
causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential
interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated
with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop
approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to
benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at

Key words: 机器人操作, 技能抽象, VQ-VAE, 代码本崩溃, 因果建模

TL;DR: 论文提出STAR框架，通过旋转增强残差技能量化和因果技能变换器，解决技能抽象学习中的代码本崩溃和因果关系建模问题，显著提升性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 现有方法使用潜在变量模型（如VQ-VAE）学习技能抽象，但存在代码本崩溃和技能间因果关系建模不足的局限。

Method: 1. 旋转增强残差技能量化（RaRSQ）防止代码本崩溃。2. 因果技能变换器（CST）通过自回归机制显式建模技能间依赖关系。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和实际任务中，STAR表现优于基线方法，提升约12%。

Conclusion: STAR通过RaRSQ和CST的联合优化，提升了技能学习和组合能力。

Abstract: Transforming complex actions into discrete skill abstractions has
demonstrated strong potential for robotic manipulation. Existing approaches
mainly leverage latent variable models, e.g., VQ-VAE, to learn skill
abstractions through learned vectors (codebooks), while they suffer from
codebook collapse and modeling the causal relationship between learned skills.
To address these limitations, we present \textbf{S}kill \textbf{T}raining with
\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{R}otation (\textbf{STAR}), a framework that advances
both skill learning and composition to complete complex behaviors.
Specifically, to prevent codebook collapse, we devise rotation-augmented
residual skill quantization (RaRSQ). It encodes relative angles between encoder
outputs into the gradient flow by rotation-based gradient mechanism. Points
within the same skill code are forced to be either pushed apart or pulled
closer together depending on gradient directions. Further, to capture the
causal relationship between skills, we present causal skill transformer (CST)
which explicitly models dependencies between skill representations through an
autoregressive mechanism for coherent action generation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of STAR on both LIBERO benchmark and realworld
tasks, with around 12\% improvement over the baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了机器人从人类视频中学习控制策略的效果，具有跨具身性和背景泛化的优势。

Abstract: Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction
for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or
action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key
challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and
pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss
of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field
to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel
framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control.
We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel
training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to
extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly.
Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that
favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background.
We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method
reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method,
achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches
fail~($\lesssim 10$\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills
like insertion.

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 自主驾驶中的控制器是关键模块，但车辆模型常因测量误差和简化而不完整。本文旨在解决这一问题，确保控制的舒适性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用混合控制方法：MPC-PID作为基础和示范部分，DRL利用MPC-PID的在线信息进行学习。控制器性能在CARLA中通过真实路径点输入评估。

Result: 实验表明，控制器在不完整车辆信息下表现良好，且DRL训练可通过示范部分稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了减少自动驾驶开发与集成工作量的潜力。

Abstract: The controller is one of the most important modules in the autonomous driving
pipeline, ensuring the vehicle reaches its desired position. In this work, a
reinforcement learning based lateral control approach, despite the
imperfections in the vehicle models due to measurement errors and
simplifications, is presented. Our approach ensures comfortable, efficient, and
robust control performance considering the interface between controlling and
other modules. The controller consists of the conventional Model Predictive
Control (MPC)-PID part as the basis and the demonstrator, and the Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) part which leverages the online information from
the MPC-PID part. The controller's performance is evaluated in CARLA using the
ground truth of the waypoints as inputs. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the controller when vehicle information is incomplete, and the
training of DRL can be stabilized with the demonstration part. These findings
highlight the potential to reduce development and integration efforts for
autonomous driving pipelines in the future.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with speech decoding from brain recordings
have broad application potential in fields such as clinical rehabilitation and
cognitive neuroscience. However, current decoding methods remain limited to
single-language, single-subject, and single neuroimaging modality settings,
restricting their clinical applicability and generalizability. Here we propose
a joint multilingual, multi-subject and multimodal decoding framework. It maps
diverse brain recordings into a unified semantic space defined by a pre-trained
multilingual model (PMM), enabling decoding across multiple languages, multiple
subjects and multiple neuroimaging modalities. The proposed framework is
validated using non-invasive brain recordings from 159 participants across four
languages. Experimental results show that it exhibits strong generalization
across multilingual, multi-subject, and multimodal settings. More importantly,
the proposed framework can promote linguistic fairness, which is vital for
underrepresented languages in BCI applications. The unified semantic space
enables cross-lingual mapping enhancement, allowing the framework to boost the
decoding performance of underrepresented languages, thereby promoting
linguistic fairness. Overall, the proposed framework establishes a new
potential paradigm for brain decoding, opening new paths for broader
applications of BCI.

Method: 提出了一种高温度Marchenko-Pastur（HTMP）随机矩阵模型，通过三个独立因素（数据复杂相关性、训练中降低的温度和降低的特征向量熵）研究重尾行为的成因。

Conclusion: HTMP模型揭示了重尾行为在深度学习中的普遍性及其与性能的关系，对理解深度学习机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent theoretical and empirical successes in deep learning, including the
celebrated neural scaling laws, are punctuated by the observation that many
objects of interest tend to exhibit some form of heavy-tailed or power law
behavior. In particular, the prevalence of heavy-tailed spectral densities in
Jacobians, Hessians, and weight matrices has led to the introduction of the
concept of heavy-tailed mechanistic universality (HT-MU). Multiple lines of
empirical evidence suggest a robust correlation between heavy-tailed metrics
and model performance, indicating that HT-MU may be a fundamental aspect of
deep learning efficacy. Here, we propose a general family of random matrix
models -- the high-temperature Marchenko-Pastur (HTMP) ensemble -- to explore
attributes that give rise to heavy-tailed behavior in trained neural networks.
Under this model, spectral densities with power laws on (upper and lower) tails
arise through a combination of three independent factors (complex correlation
structures in the data; reduced temperatures during training; and reduced
eigenvector entropy), appearing as an implicit bias in the model structure, and
they can be controlled with an "eigenvalue repulsion" parameter. Implications
of our model on other appearances of heavy tails, including neural scaling
laws, optimizer trajectories, and the five-plus-one phases of neural network
training, are discussed.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SubSearch不仅能稳健估计参数，还能有效识别异常节点，优于简单的修剪方法。

Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with methods
often relying on fitting models like the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to
observed networks. While many algorithms can accurately estimate SBM parameters
when the input graph is a perfect sample from the model, real-world graphs
rarely conform to such idealized assumptions. Therefore, robust algorithms are
crucial-ones that can recover model parameters even when the data deviates from
the assumed distribution. In this work, we propose SubSearch, an algorithm for
robustly estimating SBM parameters by exploring the space of subgraphs in
search of one that closely aligns with the model's assumptions. Our approach
also functions as an outlier detection method, properly identifying nodes
responsible for the graph's deviation from the model and going beyond simple
techniques like pruning high-degree nodes. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Due to their intuitive appeal, Bayesian methods of modeling and uncertainty
quantification have become popular in modern machine and deep learning. When
providing a prior distribution over the parameter space, it is straightforward
to obtain a distribution over the parameters that is conventionally interpreted
as uncertainty quantification of the model. We challenge the validity of such
Bayesian uncertainty quantification by discussing the equivalent
optimization-based representation of Bayesian updating, provide an alternative
interpretation that is coherent with the optimization-based perspective,
propose measures of the quality of the Bayesian inferential stage, and suggest
directions for future work.

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization problems are widespread in domains such as
logistics, manufacturing, and drug discovery, yet their NP-hard nature makes
them computationally challenging. Recent Neural Combinatorial Optimization
methods leverage deep learning to learn solution strategies, trained via
Supervised or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While promising, these approaches
often rely on task-specific augmentations, perform poorly on
out-of-distribution instances, and lack robust inference mechanisms. Moreover,
existing latent space models either require labeled data or rely on pre-trained
policies. In this work, we propose LGS-Net, a novel latent space model that
conditions on problem instances, and introduce an efficient inference method,
Latent Guided Sampling (LGS), based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Stochastic
Approximation. We show that the iterations of our method form a
time-inhomogeneous Markov Chain and provide rigorous theoretical convergence
guarantees. Empirical results on benchmark routing tasks show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance among RL-based approaches.

Conclusion: 该框架为随机矩阵应用（如深度学习中的对抗扰动）提供了高阶谱敏感性研究的实用工具。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for deriving the general $n$-th order
Fr\'echet derivatives of singular values in real rectangular matrices, by
leveraging reduced resolvent operators from Kato's analytic perturbation theory
for self-adjoint operators. Deriving closed-form expressions for higher-order
derivatives of singular values is notoriously challenging through standard
matrix-analysis techniques. To overcome this, we treat a real rectangular
matrix as a compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and embed
the rectangular matrix into a block self-adjoint operator so that non-symmetric
perturbations are captured. Applying Kato's asymptotic eigenvalue expansion to
this construction, we obtain a general, closed-form expression for the
infinitesimal $n$-th order spectral variations. Specializing to $n=2$ and
deploying on a Kronecker-product representation with matrix convention yield
the Hessian of a singular value, not found in literature. By bridging abstract
operator-theoretic perturbation theory with matrices, our framework equips
researchers with a practical toolkit for higher-order spectral sensitivity
studies in random matrix applications (e.g., adversarial perturbation in deep
learning).

Result: 结果表明优化算法和超参数对SGMs的泛化能力有显著影响，理论分析支持了这一观察。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种新的理论视角，揭示了SGMs泛化行为的关键因素。

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have emerged as one of the most popular
classes of generative models. A substantial body of work now exists on the
analysis of SGMs, focusing either on discretization aspects or on their
statistical performance. In the latter case, bounds have been derived, under
various metrics, between the true data distribution and the distribution
induced by the SGM, often demonstrating polynomial convergence rates with
respect to the number of training samples. However, these approaches adopt a
largely approximation theory viewpoint, which tends to be overly pessimistic
and relatively coarse. In particular, they fail to fully explain the empirical
success of SGMs or capture the role of the optimization algorithm used in
practice to train the score network. To support this observation, we first
present simple experiments illustrating the concrete impact of optimization
hyperparameters on the generalization ability of the generated distribution.
Then, this paper aims to bridge this theoretical gap by providing the first
algorithmic- and data-dependent generalization analysis for SGMs. In
particular, we establish bounds that explicitly account for the optimization
dynamics of the learning algorithm, offering new insights into the
generalization behavior of SGMs. Our theoretical findings are supported by
empirical results on several datasets.

Conclusion: 子组评估需要结合明确的因果假设，以控制混杂和分布变化。

Abstract: Disaggregated evaluation across subgroups is critical for assessing the
fairness of machine learning models, but its uncritical use can mislead
practitioners. We show that equal performance across subgroups is an unreliable
measure of fairness when data are representative of the relevant populations
but reflective of real-world disparities. Furthermore, when data are not
representative due to selection bias, both disaggregated evaluation and
alternative approaches based on conditional independence testing may be invalid
without explicit assumptions regarding the bias mechanism. We use causal
graphical models to predict metric stability across subgroups under different
data generating processes. Our framework suggests complementing disaggregated
evaluations with explicit causal assumptions and analysis to control for
confounding and distribution shift, including conditional independence testing
and weighted performance estimation. These findings have broad implications for
how practitioners design and interpret model assessments given the ubiquity of
disaggregated evaluation.

Conclusion: 偏好采样为LLM评估提供更高效和用户导向的决策工具。

Abstract: With the onset of large language models (LLMs), the performance of artificial
intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly multi-dimensional.
Accordingly, there have been several large, multi-dimensional evaluation
frameworks put forward to evaluate LLMs. Though these frameworks are much more
realistic than previous attempts which only used a single score like accuracy,
multi-dimensional evaluations can complicate decision-making since there is no
obvious way to select an optimal model. This work introduces preference
sampling, a method to extract a scalar trustworthiness score from
multi-dimensional evaluation results by considering the many characteristics of
model performance which users value. We show that preference sampling improves
upon alternate aggregation methods by using multi-dimensional trustworthiness
evaluations of LLMs from TrustLLM and DecodingTrust. We find that preference
sampling is consistently reductive, fully reducing the set of candidate models
100% of the time whereas Pareto optimality never reduces the set by more than
50%. Likewise, preference sampling is consistently sensitive to user
priors-allowing users to specify the relative weighting and confidence of their
preferences-whereas averaging scores is intransigent to the users' prior
knowledge.

Result: 多模型选择框架使目标距离减少55%，实验验证了点值奖励机制与Shapley值的紧密对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架支持公平、可扩展的众包参与，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align model
responses with human preferences. While RLHF employs a reinforcement learning
approach with a separate reward model, SFT uses human-curated datasets for
supervised learning. Both approaches traditionally depend on small, vetted
groups of annotators, making them costly, prone to bias, and limited in
scalability. We propose an open, crowd-sourced fine-tuning framework that
addresses these limitations by enabling broader feedback collection for SFT
without extensive annotator training. Our framework promotes incentive fairness
via a point-based reward system correlated with Shapley values and guides model
convergence through iterative model updates. Our multi-model selection
framework demonstrates up to a 55% reduction in target distance over
single-model selection, enabling subsequent experiments that validate our
point-based reward mechanism's close alignment with Shapley values (a
well-established method for attributing individual contributions) thereby
supporting fair and scalable participation.

### [258] [Automated Traffic Incident Response Plans using Generative Artificial Intelligence: Part 1 -- Building the Incident Response Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03381)
*Artur Grigorev,Khaled Saleh,Jiwon Kim,Adriana-Simona Mihaita*

Key words: 交通事件、生成式人工智能、响应基准、实时管理

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成式人工智能的交通事件响应基准，旨在通过自动生成响应计划来减少事件解决时间，提升管理效率。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.SY

Motivation: 传统人工决策的交通事件响应存在不一致性和延迟问题，亟需自动化解决方案以提高响应速度和准确性。

Method: 利用真实世界的事件报告作为训练数据，采用生成式AI模型（如GPT-4o、Grok 2和Gemini 1.5 Pro）生成响应计划，并与专家方案进行比较。

Result: GPT-4o和Grok 2在专家方案匹配度上表现最佳（Hamming距离2.96-2.98），而Gemini 1.5 Pro因过度触发动作导致效率下降。

Conclusion: 生成式AI能显著提升交通事件响应效率，但需权衡动作触发频率与计划实用性。

Abstract: Traffic incidents remain a critical public safety concern worldwide, with
Australia recording 1,300 road fatalities in 2024, which is the highest toll in
12 years. Similarly, the United States reports approximately 6 million crashes
annually, raising significant challenges in terms of a fast reponse time and
operational management. Traditional response protocols rely on human
decision-making, which introduces potential inconsistencies and delays during
critical moments when every minute impacts both safety outcomes and network
performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Incident Response
Benchmark that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically
generate response plans for incoming traffic incidents. Our approach aims to
significantly reduce incident resolution times by suggesting
context-appropriate actions such as variable message sign deployment, lane
closures, and emergency resource allocation adapted to specific incident
characteristics. First, the proposed methodology uses real-world incident
reports from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) as training and
evaluation data. We extract historically implemented actions from these reports
and compare them against AI-generated response plans that suggest specific
actions, such as lane closures, variable message sign announcements, and/or
dispatching appropriate emergency resources. Second, model evaluations reveal
that advanced generative AI models like GPT-4o and Grok 2 achieve superior
alignment with expert solutions, demonstrated by minimized Hamming distances
(averaging 2.96-2.98) and low weighted differences (approximately 0.27-0.28).
Conversely, while Gemini 1.5 Pro records the lowest count of missed actions,
its extremely high number of unnecessary actions (1547 compared to 225 for
GPT-4o) indicates an over-triggering strategy that reduces the overall plan
efficiency.

Method: 基于MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据，采用SVD插补、ADASYN平衡、RFECV和SHAP特征选择，评估八种ML模型。

Result: CatBoost模型表现最优，关键预测因素包括既往脑血管疾病、血清肌酐和收缩压。

Conclusion: 可解释ML方法有助于早期发现术后卒中并指导临床决策。

Abstract: Postoperative stroke remains a critical complication in elderly surgical
intensive care unit (SICU) patients, contributing to prolonged hospitalization,
elevated healthcare costs, and increased mortality. Accurate early risk
stratification is essential to enable timely intervention and improve clinical
outcomes. We constructed a combined cohort of 19,085 elderly SICU admissions
from the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV databases and developed an interpretable
machine learning (ML) framework to predict in-hospital stroke using clinical
data from the first 24 hours of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. The
preprocessing pipeline included removal of high-missingness features, iterative
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) imputation, z-score normalization, one-hot
encoding, and class imbalance correction via the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling
(ADASYN) algorithm. A two-stage feature selection process-combining Recursive
Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP)-reduced the initial 80 variables to 20 clinically
informative predictors. Among eight ML models evaluated, CatBoost achieved the
best performance with an AUROC of 0.8868 (95% CI: 0.8802--0.8937). SHAP
analysis and ablation studies identified prior cerebrovascular disease, serum
creatinine, and systolic blood pressure as the most influential risk factors.
Our results highlight the potential of interpretable ML approaches to support
early detection of postoperative stroke and inform decision-making in
perioperative critical care.

Conclusion: UniSite-DS和UniSite解决了现有问题，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in
Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing
methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key
challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual
protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist
across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant
statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a
discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering
algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the
actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address
these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique
Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more
multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously
most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand
binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with
bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on
Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand
binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several
representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision
provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection.
The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at

Result: QCML在样本外验证中优于传统方法，能够更准确地预测染色体不稳定性状态。

Conclusion: QCML是一种高性能的机器学习工具，适用于高维、小样本的生物医学数据，为CTCs分类提供了新方法。

Abstract: The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high
metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it
presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity
of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of
Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational
framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs
from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical
principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling
context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced
generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms
conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification
CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state
transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These
preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine
learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size
biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for
the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal
instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification
in liquid biopsy.

Abstract: With over 1,000,000 images from more than 10,000 exposures using
state-of-the-art high-contrast imagers (e.g., Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE)
in the search for exoplanets, can artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a
transformative tool in imaging Earth-like exoplanets in the coming decade? In
this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a
polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive
investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly
imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of
reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects
(disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light
dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of
exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar
disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since
2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of
models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and
provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative
representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving
superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge,
this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset,
rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and
baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data
scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major
interdisciplinary breakthroughs.

Motivation: 研究在线学习算法在游戏自我对弈中的收敛性问题，尤其是最后迭代收敛，以更好地反映学习者的实际决策行为。

Method: 提出一种黑盒方法，将平均迭代收敛的学习动态转化为最后迭代收敛的动态，并应用于乐观乘法权重更新算法。

Result: 在双人零和博弈中，实现了维度依赖性指数级改进的收敛速率（梯度反馈下$O(\frac{\log d}{T})$，带反馈下$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{5}} T^{-\frac{1}{5}})$）。

Conclusion: 该方法为广受欢迎的最后迭代收敛提供了简单且通用的解决方案，显著提升了收敛速率。

Abstract: The convergence of online learning algorithms in games under self-play is a
fundamental question in game theory and machine learning. Among various notions
of convergence, last-iterate convergence is particularly desirable, as it
reflects the actual decisions made by the learners and captures the day-to-day
behavior of the learning dynamics. While many algorithms are known to converge
in the average-iterate, achieving last-iterate convergence typically requires
considerably more effort in both the design and the analysis of the algorithm.
Somewhat surprisingly, we show in this paper that for a large family of games,
there exists a simple black-box reduction that transforms the average iterates
of an uncoupled learning dynamics into the last iterates of a new uncoupled
learning dynamics, thus also providing a reduction from last-iterate
convergence to average-iterate convergence. Our reduction applies to games
where each player's utility is linear in both their own strategy and the joint
strategy of all opponents. This family includes two-player bimatrix games and
generalizations such as multi-player polymatrix games. By applying our
reduction to the Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm, we obtain
new state-of-the-art last-iterate convergence rates for uncoupled learning
dynamics in two-player zero-sum normal-form games: (1) an $O(\frac{\log d}{T})$
last-iterate convergence rate under gradient feedback, representing an
exponential improvement in the dependence on the dimension $d$ (i.e., the
maximum number of actions available to either player); and (2) an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{5}} T^{-\frac{1}{5}})$ last-iterate convergence rate
under bandit feedback, improving upon the previous best rates of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d} T^{-\frac{1}{8}})$ and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d}
T^{-\frac{1}{6}})$.

Method: 构建了包含200K示例的VisCode-200K数据集，结合开源代码和修正对话，并微调模型Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct。

Result: VisCoder在PandasPlotBench上表现优异，接近GPT-4o-mini性能，并通过自调试评估证明了反馈学习的优势。

Conclusion: 反馈驱动的学习能显著提升可执行且视觉准确的代码生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like
plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and
visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded
supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting
in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and
self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated
plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language
instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues
from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime
feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create
VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly
outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of
proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation
protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of

Conclusion: LLMs 在代码语义理解方面仍有不足，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In
this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively
unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether
they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since
benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM
capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards
this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations
Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the
repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our
dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying
a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in
(non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising
finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of
programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the
task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple
fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of
programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with
repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying
varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we
perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as
the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking.
Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of
code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what
could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.

This paper proposes a novel framework integrating Generative Artificial

Abstract: Traditional Business Process Management (BPM) struggles with rigidity,
opacity, and scalability in dynamic environments while emerging Large Language
Models (LLMs) present transformative opportunities alongside risks. This paper
explores four real-world use cases that demonstrate how LLMs, augmented with
trustworthy process intelligence, redefine process modeling, prediction, and
automation. Grounded in early-stage research projects with industrial partners,
the work spans manufacturing, modeling, life-science, and design processes,
addressing domain-specific challenges through human-AI collaboration. In
manufacturing, an LLM-driven framework integrates uncertainty-aware explainable
Machine Learning (ML) with interactive dialogues, transforming opaque
predictions into auditable workflows. For process modeling, conversational
interfaces democratize BPMN design. Pharmacovigilance agents automate drug
safety monitoring via knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs. Finally, sustainable
textile design employs multi-agent systems to navigate regulatory and
environmental trade-offs. We intend to examine tensions between transparency
and efficiency, generalization and specialization, and human agency versus
automation. By mapping these trade-offs, we advocate for context-sensitive
integration prioritizing domain needs, stakeholder values, and iterative
human-in-the-loop workflows over universal solutions. This work provides
actionable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming to operationalize
LLMs in critical BPM environments.

Transitive Consistency of a matching, a measure of the consistency of a
pairwise matching model f_theta on the matching it produces G_f_theta, based
both on its predictions on directly evaluated record pairs and its predictions
on implied record pairs. TransClean iteratively modifies a matching through
gradually removing false positive matches while removing as few true positive
matches as possible. In each of these steps, the estimation of the Transitive
Consistency is exclusively done through model evaluations and produces
quantities that can be used as proxies of the amounts of true and false
positives in the matching while not requiring any manual labeling, producing an
estimate of the quality of the matching and indicating which record groups are
likely to contain false positives. In our experiments, we compare combining
TransClean with a naively trained pairwise matching model (DistilBERT) and with
a state-of-the-art end-to-end matching method (CLER) and illustrate the
flexibility of TransClean in being able to detect most of the false positives
of either setup across a variety of datasets. Our experiments show that
TransClean induces an average +24.42 F1 score improvement for entity matching
in a multi-source setting when compared to traditional pair-wise matching
algorithms.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation holds significant potential to reduce
radiologists' workload and enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, generating
precise and clinically meaningful reports from chest radiographs remains
challenging due to the complexity of medical language and the need for

and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning. LLaMA-XR achieves
improved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. This efficiency is driven by an optimization strategy that enhances
parameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report
generation with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments
conducted on the IU X-ray benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-XR
outperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a ROUGE-L
score of 0.433 and a METEOR score of 0.336, establishing new performance
benchmarks in the domain. These results underscore LLaMA-XR's potential as an

Result: 计算效率提升，重建质量与传统PD-AI方法相当，优于临床标准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限设备提供高分辨率MRI重建方案，具现实应用潜力。

Abstract: Physics-driven artificial intelligence (PD-AI) reconstruction methods have
emerged as the state-of-the-art for accelerating MRI scans, enabling higher
spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the high resolution of these scans
generates massive data volumes, leading to challenges in transmission, storage,
and real-time processing. This is particularly pronounced in functional MRI,
where hundreds of volumetric acquisitions further exacerbate these demands.
Edge computing with FPGAs presents a promising solution for enabling PD-AI
reconstruction near the MRI sensors, reducing data transfer and storage
bottlenecks. However, this requires optimization of PD-AI models for hardware
efficiency through quantization and bypassing traditional FFT-based approaches,
which can be a limitation due to their computational demands. In this work, we
propose a novel PD-AI computational MRI approach optimized for FPGA-based edge
computing devices, leveraging 8-bit complex data quantization and eliminating
redundant FFT/IFFT operations. Our results show that this strategy improves
computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to
conventional PD-AI methods, and outperforms standard clinical methods. Our
approach presents an opportunity for high-resolution MRI reconstruction on
resource-constrained devices, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment.

Abstract: Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides
crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However,
rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a
significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such
as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and
hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet
quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer
variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for
comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset.
We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver
patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with
expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal
tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis,
and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art
multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as
baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results
demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver
assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated
and intelligent donor liver assessment research. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Macular Hole (MH)
significantly impact vision and affect millions worldwide. Early detection is
crucial, as DR, a complication of diabetes, damages retinal blood vessels,
potentially leading to blindness, while MH disrupts central vision, affecting
tasks like reading and facial recognition. This paper employed two lightweight
and efficient Convolution Neural Network architectures, MobileNet and
NASNetMobile, for the classification of Normal, DR, and MH retinal images. The
models were trained on the RFMiD dataset, consisting of 3,200 fundus images,
after undergoing preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and
augmentation. To address data scarcity, this study leveraged transfer learning
and data augmentation techniques, enhancing model generalization and
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that MobileNetV2 achieved the
highest accuracy of 90.8%, outperforming NASNetMobile, which achieved 89.5%
accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of CNNs in retinal disease
classification, providing a foundation for AI-assisted ophthalmic diagnosis and
early intervention.

Conclusion: 该集成传感器和iOS应用能帮助医疗专业人员实时监控伤口状况并跟踪愈合进展。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a class of chronic wounds, affect ~750,000
individuals every year in the US alone and identifying non-healing DFUs that
develop to chronic wounds early can drastically reduce treatment costs and
minimize risks of amputation. There is therefore a pressing need for diagnostic
tools that can detect non-healing DFUs early. We develop a low cost,
multi-analyte 3D printed assays seamlessly integrated on swabs that can
identify non-healing DFUs and a Wound Sensor iOS App - an innovative mobile
application developed for the controlled acquisition and automated analysis of
wound sensor data. By comparing both the original base image (before exposure
to the wound) and the wound-exposed image, we developed automated computer
vision techniques to compare density changes between the two assay images,
which allow us to automatically determine the severity of the wound. The iOS
app ensures accurate data collection and presents actionable insights, despite
challenges such as variations in camera configurations and ambient conditions.
The proposed integrated sensor and iOS app will allow healthcare professionals
to monitor wound conditions real-time, track healing progress, and assess
critical parameters related to wound care.

Abstract: CubeSats offer a low-cost platform for space research, particularly for Earth
observation. However, their resource-constrained nature and being in space,
challenge the flexibility and complexity of the deployed image processing
pipelines and their orchestration. This paper introduces two novel systems,
DIPP and DISH, to address these challenges. DIPP is a modular and configurable
image processing pipeline framework that allows for adaptability to changing
mission goals even after deployment, while preserving robustness. DISH is a
domain-specific language (DSL) and runtime system designed to schedule complex
imaging workloads on low-power and memory-constrained processors.
  Our experiments demonstrate that DIPP's decomposition of the processing
pipelines adds negligible overhead, while significantly reducing the network
requirements of updating pipelines and being robust against erroneous module
uploads. Furthermore, we compare DISH to Lua, a general purpose scripting
language, and demonstrate its comparable expressiveness and lower memory
requirement.

Abstract: Craniosynostosis is a medical condition that affects the growth of babies'
heads, caused by an early fusion of cranial sutures. In recent decades,
surgical treatments for craniosynostosis have significantly improved, leading
to reduced invasiveness, faster recovery, and less blood loss. At Great Ormond
Street Hospital (GOSH), the main surgical treatment for patients diagnosed with
sagittal craniosynostosis (SC) is spring assisted cranioplasty (SAC). This
procedure involves a 15x15 mm2 osteotomy, where two springs are inserted to
induce distraction. Despite the numerous advantages of this surgical technique
for patients, the outcome remains unpredictable due to the lack of efficient
preoperative planning tools. The surgeon's experience and the baby's age are
currently relied upon to determine the osteotomy location and spring selection.
Previous tools for predicting the surgical outcome of SC relied on finite
element modeling (FEM), which involved computed tomography (CT) imaging and
required engineering expertise and lengthy calculations. The main goal of this
research is to develop a real-time prediction tool for the surgical outcome of
patients, eliminating the need for CT scans to minimise radiation exposure
during preoperative planning. The proposed methodology involves creating
personalised synthetic skulls based on three-dimensional (3D) photographs,
incorporating population average values of suture location, skull thickness,
and soft tissue properties. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is employed
to achieve the desired surgical outcome. The resulting multi-output support
vector regressor model achieves a R2 metric of 0.95 and MSE and MAE below 0.13.
Furthermore, in the future, this model could not only simulate various surgical
scenarios but also provide optimal parameters for achieving a maximum cranial
index (CI).

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) is a prominent research topic in low-level
computer vision, where deep learning technologies have played a significant
role. The rapid progress in deep learning and its applications in VSR has led
to a proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature. However, the
usage of these methods is often not adequately explained, and decisions are
primarily driven by quantitative improvements. Given the significance of VSR's
potential influence across multiple domains, it is imperative to conduct a
comprehensive analysis of the elements and deep learning methodologies employed
in VSR research. This methodical analysis will facilitate the informed
development of models tailored to specific application needs. In this paper, we
present an overarching overview of deep learning-based video super-resolution
models, investigating each component and discussing its implications.
Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of key components and technologies employed
by state-of-the-art and earlier VSR models. By elucidating the underlying
methodologies and categorising them systematically, we identified trends,
requirements, and challenges in the domain. As a first-of-its-kind survey of
deep learning-based VSR models, this work also establishes a multi-level
taxonomy to guide current and future VSR research, enhancing the maturation and
interpretation of VSR practices for various practical applications.

Abstract: Skin cancer is among the most prevalent and life-threatening diseases
worldwide, with early detection being critical to patient outcomes. This work
presents a hybrid machine and deep learning-based approach for classifying
malignant and benign skin lesions using the SLICE-3D dataset from ISIC 2024,
which comprises 401,059 cropped lesion images extracted from 3D Total Body
Photography (TBP), emulating non-dermoscopic, smartphone-like conditions. Our
method combines vision transformers (EVA02) and our designed convolutional ViT
hybrid (EdgeNeXtSAC) to extract robust features, employing a
segmentation-assisted classification pipeline to enhance lesion localization.
Predictions from these models are fused with a gradient-boosted decision tree

metrics. To address class imbalance and improve generalization, we augment
malignant cases with Stable Diffusion-generated synthetic lesions and apply a
diagnosis-informed relabeling strategy to harmonize external datasets into a

Key words: 医疗成像、概念激活向量、潜在空间、可解释性、自编码器

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将临床概念映射到生成模型潜在空间的方法，通过识别概念激活向量（CAVs）以实现模型的临床对齐和可解释性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 研究旨在确保医疗成像模型与临床知识和可解释性对齐，避免依赖显式标签训练。

Method: 使用简单的重建自编码器，将用户定义的概念与图像级特征关联，提取跨数据集稳定的概念。

Result: 在胸片数据中，该方法对大病理（如心脏肥大）有效，但对小病理效果有限。通过潜在空间遍历生成了临床特征的反事实解释。

Conclusion: 尽管未超越基线方法，但为临床知识对齐的可解释性提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: An essential step in deploying medical imaging models is ensuring alignment
with clinical knowledge and interpretability. We focus on mapping clinical
concepts into the latent space of generative models to identify Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs). Using a simple reconstruction autoencoder, we link
user-defined concepts to image-level features without explicit label training.
The extracted concepts are stable across datasets, enabling visual explanations
that highlight clinically relevant features. By traversing latent space along
concept directions, we produce counterfactuals that exaggerate or reduce
specific clinical features. Preliminary results on chest X-rays show promise
for large pathologies like cardiomegaly, while smaller pathologies remain
challenging due to reconstruction limits. Although not outperforming baselines,
this approach offers a path toward interpretable, concept-based explanations
aligned with clinical knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 传统插值方法在大形变下表现不佳，导致伪影和空间不一致性，需要新方法提升动态MRI的时空分辨率。

Method: 结合扩散模型的时空超分辨技术和三向Mamba模块，利用长程上下文信息解决跨切片错位问题。

Result: 在ACDC心脏MRI和4D膝关节数据集上，TSSC-Net实现了6倍时间超分辨率且保持空间一致性。

Conclusion: TSSC-Net能高效生成高分辨率动态MRI，适用于快速运动场景。

Abstract: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the
trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time
that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude
motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based
interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle
with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and
diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose
TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving
spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our
diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames
using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal
super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel
tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual
information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from
cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting
cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC
cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results
demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from
fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.

Abstract: Over the past decade, Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) using Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) has achieved significant performance improvements and holds
great promise for future developments. This paper presents a comprehensive
study on MIS based on DNNs. Intelligent Vision Systems are often evaluated
based on their output levels, such as Data, Information, Knowledge,
Intelligence, and Wisdom (DIKIW),and the state-of-the-art solutions in MIS at
these levels are the focus of research. Additionally, Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) has become an important research direction, as it aims to
uncover the "black box" nature of previous DNN architectures to meet the
requirements of transparency and ethics. The study emphasizes the importance of
MIS in disease diagnosis and early detection, particularly for increasing the
survival rate of cancer patients through timely diagnosis. XAI and early
prediction are considered two important steps in the journey from
"intelligence" to "wisdom." Additionally, the paper addresses existing
challenges and proposes potential solutions to enhance the efficiency of
implementing DNN-based MIS.

Main category: cs.MA

Motivation: 针对Dec-POMDPs的高复杂度问题，研究在局部依赖多智能体MDP中的可观测性挑战，特别是小固定可视性下策略性能不佳的“Penalty Jittering”现象。

Method: 提出Extended Cutoff Policy Class，该策略类能记忆超出可视范围的智能体，并在局部依赖多智能体MDP中理论验证其接近最优性。还扩展了模型以包含状态转移和奖励依赖。

Result: 新策略显著改善了小固定可视性下的性能，解决了“Penalty Jittering”问题，并在特定条件下实现了完全可观测的最优行为。

Conclusion: Extended Cutoff Policy Class为局部依赖多智能体MDP提供了一个有效的解决方案，具有理论保证和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are
known to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such
as cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic
assumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work
DeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the
Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three
closed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and
are exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is
also shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility
is small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called
"Penalty Jittering" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff
Policy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial
class of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are
exponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally
Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents
beyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in
many small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering
occurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint
optimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a
generalized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for
transition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our
theoretical results in this setting.

Motivation: 现有的L0惩罚优化方法主要针对二次损失，使用'Big-M'约束或L2范数惩罚，限制了灵活性和适用范围。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种通用的分支定界方法，支持广泛的损失函数和松弛设计，引入了通用惩罚项，涵盖现有技术作为特例。

Result: 通过理论分析证明了所有关键量在闭式表达下的可行性，并开发了开源求解器El0ps，在实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性和灵活性，能够解决传统方法难以处理的问题，并通过El0ps实现了高效的求解。

Abstract: We present a generic Branch-and-Bound procedure designed to solve
L0-penalized optimization problems. Existing approaches primarily focus on
quadratic losses and construct relaxations using "Big-M" constraints and/or
L2-norm penalties. In contrast, our method accommodates a broader class of loss
functions and allows greater flexibility in relaxation design through a general
penalty term, encompassing existing techniques as special cases. We establish
theoretical results ensuring that all key quantities required for the
Branch-and-Bound implementation admit closed-form expressions under the general
blanket assumptions considered in our work. Leveraging this framework, we
introduce El0ps, an open-source Python solver with a plug-and-play workflow
that enables user-defined losses and penalties in L0-penalized problems.
Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that El0ps achieves
state-of-the-art performance on classical instances and extends computational
feasibility to previously intractable ones.

Abstract: Fuzzy clustering, which allows an article to belong to multiple clusters with
soft membership degrees, plays a vital role in analyzing publication data. This
problem can be formulated as a constrained optimization model, where the goal
is to minimize the discrepancy between the similarity observed from data and
the similarity derived from a predicted distribution. While this approach
benefits from leveraging state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, tailoring
them to work with real, massive databases like OpenAlex or Web of Science -
containing about 70 million articles and a billion citations - poses
significant challenges. We analyze potentials and challenges of the approach
from both mathematical and computational perspectives. Among other things,
second-order optimality conditions are established, providing new theoretical
insights, and practical solution methods are proposed by exploiting the
structure of the problem. Specifically, we accelerate the gradient projection
method using GPU-based parallel computing to efficiently handle large-scale
data.

Motivation: 现有的音频深度伪造检测中，SHAP和LRP等解释性技术由于缺乏清晰的地面真实注释而难以评估。即使能够获得地面真实数据，这些方法也无法提供准确的解释。

Method: 使用配对真实和声音处理音频，提取其时频表示的差异作为地面真实解释。通过差异信号监督训练扩散模型，以暴露深度伪造音频中的伪影。

Result: 在VocV4和LibriSeVoc数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于传统的解释性技术。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动方法为深度伪造音频检测提供了更准确的解释性技术，显著改善了伪影区域的识别效果。

Abstract: Evaluating explainability techniques, such as SHAP and LRP, in the context of
audio deepfake detection is challenging due to lack of clear ground truth
annotations. In the cases when we are able to obtain the ground truth, we find
that these methods struggle to provide accurate explanations. In this work, we
propose a novel data-driven approach to identify artifact regions in deepfake
audio. We consider paired real and vocoded audio, and use the difference in
time-frequency representation as the ground-truth explanation. The difference
signal then serves as a supervision to train a diffusion model to expose the
deepfake artifacts in a given vocoded audio. Experimental results on the VocV4
and LibriSeVoc datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional
explainability techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 自监督学习在低资源语言声调识别中具有潜力，但受声调种类和方言影响。

Abstract: This study explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tone
recognition in three low-resource languages from North Eastern India: Angami,
Ao, and Mizo. We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on
both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the
layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results
show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle
layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition,
regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also
found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone
recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the
potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings. The source

Result: 模型大小减少了83%，且合成质量优于未量化的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少模型大小的同时保持了高性能，适合设备端部署。

Abstract: This paper proposes a highly compact, lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) model
for on-device applications. To reduce the model size, the proposed model
introduces two techniques. First, we introduce quantization-aware training
(QAT), which quantizes model parameters during training to as low as 1.58-bit.
In this case, most of 32-bit model parameters are quantized to ternary values
{-1, 0, 1}. Second, we propose a method named weight indexing. In this method,
we save a group of 1.58-bit weights as a single int8 index. This allows for
efficient storage of model parameters, even on hardware that treats values in
units of 8-bit. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieved 83 % reduction in model size, while outperforming the baseline of
similar model size without quantization in synthesis quality.

Abstract: Human beings rely heavily on estimation of poses in order to access their
body movements. Human pose estimation methods take advantage of computer vision
advances in order to track human body movements in real life applications. This
comes from videos which are recorded through available devices. These
para-digms provide potential to make human movement measurement more accessible
to users. The consumers of pose estimation movements believe that human poses
content tend to supplement available videos. This has increased pose estimation
software usage to estimate human poses. In order to address this problem, we
develop hybrid-ensemble-based group pose estimation method to improve human

to detect multi-person poses using modified group pose estimation and modified
real time pose estimation. This ensemble allows fusion of performance of stated
methods in real time. The input poses from images are fed into individual
meth-ods. The pose transformation method helps to identify relevant features
for en-semble to perform training effectively. After this, customized
pre-trained hybrid ensemble is trained on public benchmarked datasets which is
being evaluated through test datasets. The effectiveness and viability of
proposed method is estab-lished based on comparative analysis of group pose
estimation methods and ex-periments conducted on benchmarked datasets. It
provides best optimized results in real-time pose estimation. It makes pose
estimation method more robust to oc-clusion and improves dense regression

Abstract: The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses,
especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a
serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models
with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a
plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A
trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such
models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved
$100\%$ attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than \emph{perfect}
accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate
method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models
leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of
coding theory.

frame by frame, the proposed method uses thumbnail containers to significantly
reduce computational complexity without sacrificing semantic relevance. The
framework employs a hierarchical analysis approach, where a lightweight 2D CNN
model identifies user-preferred content from thumbnails and generates
timestamps to create fast-forward summaries. Our interactive demo highlights
the system's ability to create tailored video summaries for long-form videos,
such as movies, sports events, and TV shows, based on individual user
preferences. The entire computation occurs seamlessly on resource-constrained
devices like Jetson Nano, demonstrating how EdgeVidSum addresses the critical
challenges of computational efficiency, personalization, and privacy in modern

Motivation: 物理智能是下一代世界模型的关键，而现有模型在无界表面增长的动态环境中表现不足。

Method: FOLIAGE通过统一编码器和物理感知预测器生成MAGE嵌入，利用AGN捕捉动态连接性，并结合几何对应融合与层次池化。

Conclusion: FOLIAGE为物理智能提供了一种多模态世界模型的新途径。

Abstract: Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial,
multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We
propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded
accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context
encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent
state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions,
advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the
surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces
with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network
(AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and
Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch
Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances
global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model
learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal
Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse
surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation
suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material
estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal
retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout,
zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation --
to probe resilience. FOLIAGE outperforms specialized baselines while remaining

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型在全身人类活动分析方面存在不足，无法通过第一人称视角充分捕捉细节。

Method: 提出AURA-MFM模型，整合第三人称视频、动作捕捉、IMU和文本四种模态，并采用基于Transformer的IMU编码器。

Result: 实验结果表明，模型在检索和活动识别任务中表现优异，特别是在零样本动作分类中，F1分数和准确率显著高于现有方法。

Conclusion: AURA-MFM通过多模态融合和细节捕捉，显著提升了人类活动的理解和识别能力。

Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of wearable devices has highlighted
the growing importance of behavior analysis using IMU. While applications span
diverse fields such as healthcare and robotics, recent studies have
increasingly focused on multimodal analysis, in addition to unimodal analysis.
Several studies have proposed multimodal foundation models that incorporate
first-person video and text data; however, these models still fall short in
providing a detailed analysis of full-body human activity. To address this
limitation, we propose Activity Understanding and Representations Alignment -
Multimodal Foundation Model (AURA-MFM), a foundational model integrating four
modalities: third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text. By incorporating
third-person video and motion capture data, the model enables a detailed and
multidimensional understanding of human activity, which first-person
perspectives alone fail to capture. Additionally, a Transformer-based IMU
encoder is employed to enhance the model's overall performance. Experimental
evaluations on retrieval and activity recognition tasks demonstrate that our
model surpasses existing methods. Notably, in the zero-shot classification for
action recognition, our method achieved significantly higher performance, with
an F1-score of 0.6226 and an accuracy of 0.7320, whereas the existing method
recorded an F1-score of 0.0747 and an accuracy of 0.1961.

TL;DR: 提出了Vid-SME，一种针对视频理解大语言模型中视频数据的会员推断方法，解决了现有方法在视频领域泛化能力不足的问题。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型在视频理解中的应用日益广泛，其中可能包含敏感视频内容，因此需要解决训练数据中视频的不当使用问题。

Method: Vid-SME利用模型输出的置信度，通过自适应参数化计算视频输入的Sharma-Mittal熵（SME），并结合自然和时序反转视频帧的SME差异来推断会员资格。

Result: 实验表明，Vid-SME在多种自训练和开源视频理解大语言模型上表现出色。

Conclusion: Vid-SME为解决视频数据的隐私保护问题提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
in handling complex multimodal tasks and are increasingly adopted in video
understanding applications. However, their rapid advancement raises serious
data privacy concerns, particularly given the potential inclusion of sensitive
video content, such as personal recordings and surveillance footage, in their
training datasets. Determining improperly used videos during training remains a
critical and unresolved challenge. Despite considerable progress on membership
inference attacks (MIAs) for text and image data in MLLMs, existing methods
fail to generalize effectively to the video domain. These methods suffer from
poor scalability as more frames are sampled and generally achieve negligible
true positive rates at low false positive rates (TPR@Low FPR), mainly due to
their failure to capture the inherent temporal variations of video frames and
to account for model behavior differences as the number of frames varies. To
address these challenges, we introduce Vid-SME, the first membership inference
method tailored for video data used in video understanding LLMs (VULLMs).
Vid-SME leverages the confidence of model output and integrates adaptive
parameterization to compute Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs. By
leveraging the SME difference between natural and temporally-reversed video
frames, Vid-SME derives robust membership scores to determine whether a given
video is part of the model's training set. Experiments on various self-trained
and open-sourced VULLMs demonstrate the strong effectiveness of Vid-SME.

<details>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要依赖于顺序微调，导致对新任务的偏好和旧知识的遗忘，缺乏稳定性与可塑性的平衡。

Method: 提出一种模型合并方法，通过合并新旧任务参数而非顺序更新权重，同时引入机制确保新旧权重对齐以避免干扰。

Result: 在大规模视觉语言模型上验证了方法的有效性，显著减少遗忘，提升对任务顺序和相似性的鲁棒性，并改善泛化能力。

Conclusion: 模型合并方法在持续学习中实现了稳定性与可塑性的更好平衡，为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual learning is conventionally tackled through sequential fine-tuning,
a process that, while enabling adaptation, inherently favors plasticity over
the stability needed to retain prior knowledge. While existing approaches
attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, a bias towards recent tasks
persists as they build upon this sequential nature. In this work we present a
new perspective based on model merging to maintain stability while still
retaining plasticity. Rather than just sequentially updating the model weights,
we propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones,
promoting a better balance. To maximize the effectiveness of the merging
process, we propose a simple mechanism that promotes learning aligned weights
with previous ones, thereby avoiding interference when merging. We evaluate
this approach on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and demonstrate its
effectiveness in reducing forgetting, increasing robustness to various task
orders and similarities, and improving generalization.

<details>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决现有测试时适应方法在动态适应复杂分层视觉语义信息时未能充分利用模型内部知识的问题。

Method: 基于人类联想记忆理论，MINT设计了一个记忆提示库（MPB），存储可学习的键值提示对，并在测试时通过分层视觉特征检索相关提示对，动态组装关联提示并注入图像编码器。

Result: MINT无需源数据或重新训练，即可实现快速、精确的测试时模型适应。

Conclusion: MINT通过记忆提示库显著提升了模型在测试时的适应能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Improving the generalization ability of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models
(VLMs) under test-time data distribution shifts remains a critical challenge.
The existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods fall short in fully leveraging
the model's internal knowledge, particularly in dynamically adapting to complex
and hierarchical visual semantic information. In this paper, we propose
Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT), a novel framework to address this issue.
Inspired by human associative memory theory, MINT introduces a Memory Prompt
Bank (MPB), which stores learnable key-value prompt pairs that work as a memory
of previously seen samples. During the test time, relevant prompt pairs in the
MPB are retrieved by the hierarchical visual features of test images to
dynamically assemble Associative Prompts. The associative prompts are then
injected into the image encoder for fine-grained, customized visual contextual
guidance. MINT also utilizes learnable text prompts. MINT thus enables rapid,
precise VLM adaptation at test time by leveraging this MPB-acquired memory,
without source data or retraining. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth survey on the use of multimodal Generative
Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs)
for human motion understanding and generation, offering insights into emerging
methods, architectures, and their potential to advance realistic and versatile
motion synthesis. Focusing exclusively on text and motion modalities, this
research investigates how textual descriptions can guide the generation of
complex, human-like motion sequences. The paper explores various generative
approaches, including autoregressive models, diffusion models, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
transformer-based models, by analyzing their strengths and limitations in terms
of motion quality, computational efficiency, and adaptability. It highlights
recent advances in text-conditioned motion generation, where textual inputs are
used to control and refine motion outputs with greater precision. The
integration of LLMs further enhances these models by enabling semantic
alignment between instructions and motion, improving coherence and contextual
relevance. This systematic survey underscores the transformative potential of
text-to-motion GenAI and LLM architectures in applications such as healthcare,
humanoids, gaming, animation, and assistive technologies, while addressing
ongoing challenges in generating efficient and realistic human motion.

Method: 创建HueManity数据集，包含83,850张Ishihara测试风格图像，评估9种领先MLLM的精确模式识别能力。

Result: MLLM在数字“简单”任务上最高准确率为33.6%，字母数字“困难”任务仅3%，远低于人类（100%、95.6%）和ResNet50（96.5%、94.5%）。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在视觉感知能力上存在重大缺陷，需改进架构和训练范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual
reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains
surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess
visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring
two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot
patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of
nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance
deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The
best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a
striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants
achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model
reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap
in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores
potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this
perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster
further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 细粒度图像分类需要关注细微的视觉差异，而多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）容易忽略这些细节，因此需要一种方法来自动学习描述性提示以提升分类准确性。

Method: AutoSEP通过自监督方式，利用未标注数据迭代优化描述性提示，帮助MLLMs识别图像中的关键判别特征，且仅需黑盒访问MLLMs。

Result: 在多个细粒度分类数据集上，AutoSEP比零样本分类和其他无监督基线方法表现更优，平均提升13%和5%。

Conclusion: AutoSEP有效提升了MLLMs在细粒度分类任务中的性能，且无需训练或微调。

Abstract: Despite Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing promising results on
general zero-shot image classification tasks, fine-grained image classification
remains challenging. It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to
distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may
easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce
AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to
enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised
manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description
prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within
an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic
self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve
the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level
classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to
MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our
approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently
outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average
improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over
the best-performing baselines. Code is available at:

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured,
machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as
traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited
adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end
reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly
layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance,
paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly
released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic
scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we
instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called
Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and
formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new
state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity,
outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We
will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust

Conclusion: FLEX推动了AQA方法和数据集向多模态和多动作场景发展，促进了AI在健身领域的应用。

Abstract: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic
physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks
associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness
actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology
that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the
potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving
better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets
are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and
lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this
gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action,
large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals
into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different
weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels
for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D
pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates
knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty
functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and
feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating
that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations
significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA
methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but
also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness
domain. Dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: OpenCarbon模型为高效碳排放治理和针对性减排规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurately estimating high-resolution carbon emissions is crucial for
effective emission governance and mitigation planning. While conventional
methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data
collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques
offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is
developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on
available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open
data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict
high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing
macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively
dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon
emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit
effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial
contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model,
OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a
cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract
complementary functionality information from two modules and model their
interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the
spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's
superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\% on R2. Further
generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to
capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon
emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and
targeted carbon mitigation planning. Codes and data are available:

Conclusion: Co-Reg方法能有效处理预训练模型生成的实例依赖噪声标签，为无人工标注的训练任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample
is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy
annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language
models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these
models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve
"manual-annotation-free" training for downstream tasks has become a highly
promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial
labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative
consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise
primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by
pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of
the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning
difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural
networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a
"Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization
constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our
method can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further
enhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and
disambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model
application schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method,
while revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning
techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.

<details>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: DiTs 在推理时存在计算冗余，希望通过动态稀疏技术减少冗余，加速推理而不影响生成质量。

Method: Chipmunk 通过动态稀疏仅计算变化最快的中间激活，并缓存其余部分，同时优化 GPU 利用率和计算延迟。

Result: Chipmunk 在 HunyuanVideo 和 FLUX 等模型上实现最高 3.72 倍加速，且生成质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: 动态稀疏方法 Chipmunk 能有效减少 DiTs 推理时的计算冗余，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at
inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly
across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant
across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this
redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change
between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25%
of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations
across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic
sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate
activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems
challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU
tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and
caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges,
Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce
column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient
sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at
93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk
overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other
parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra
latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on
FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that
Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup
on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev
with minimal quality impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决空间蛋白质组学中缺乏通用基础模型的问题，提升蛋白质单细胞分辨率分析的能力。

Method: 自监督学习训练模型，针对多通道、高维图像进行关键架构调整，处理47百万图像块。

Result: 在11个独立队列中实现最优性能，适用于细胞分型、区域分类和患者分层等任务。

Conclusion: KRONOS是一个灵活且可扩展的空间蛋白质组学工具，支持无分割处理和多尺度分析。

Abstract: Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as
pretrained generalist backbones that can be adapted to many tasks even when
post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging
that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we
introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was
trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering
175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging
platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the
high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging.
We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations
across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue
levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell
phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated
across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance
across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks,
and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of
segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial
proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image
reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position
KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is

Key words: Chain-of-Thought reasoning, video understanding, domain adaptation, skill taxonomy, expert learning

TL;DR: Video-SKoT框架通过自动构建基于技能的CoT监督，提升了视频理解的适应性，并在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有CoT推理方法难以适应视频内容中的领域特定技能（如事件检测、空间关系理解等），需改进以实现领域自适应视频推理。

Method: 1) 构建基于技能的CoT标注：提取训练问题中的领域相关推理技能，聚类为共享技能分类，并为每个视频-问题对创建多步推理CoT；2) 提出技能特定的专家学习框架，每个专家模块专注于部分推理技能并通过轻量级适配器训练。

Result: 在三个视频理解基准测试中，Video-SKoT表现优于基线模型，同时提供了不同CoT标注流程和学习技能的深入分析。

Conclusion: Video-SKoT通过技能感知的CoT监督显著提升了复杂视频理解的适应性，展示了在多样化视频领域中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex
video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to
domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding,
emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose
Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs
and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning.
First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant
reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill
taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each
video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert
learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning
skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT
supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three
video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms
strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT
annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Method: 使用图卷积网络的邻接矩阵对角线约束，设计硬和软约束两种对角化算法，并结合对角线约束和互补约束的损失函数。

Result: 在Pascal VOC上mAP50比YOLOv1高7.5%，在MS COCO上分别比YOLOv3u、YOLOv5u和YOLOv8高5.1%、3.7%和2.9%。

Conclusion: DaigNet通过邻接矩阵对角线约束避免了锚框设计，显著提升了对象检测的性能。

Abstract: We propose DaigNet, a new approach to object detection with which we can
detect an object bounding box using diagonal constraints on adjacency matrix of
a graph convolutional network (GCN). We propose two diagonalization algorithms
based on hard and soft constraints on adjacency matrix and two loss functions
using diagonal constraint and complementary constraint. The DaigNet eliminates
the need for designing a set of anchor boxes commonly used. To prove
feasibility of our novel detector, we adopt detection head in YOLO models.
Experiments show that the DiagNet achieves 7.5% higher mAP50 on Pascal VOC than
YOLOv1. The DiagNet also shows 5.1% higher mAP on MS COCO than YOLOv3u, 3.7%
higher mAP than YOLOv5u, and 2.9% higher mAP than YOLOv8.

Result: 在STL-10和CIFAR-10/100数据集上以极少量标注样本取得最优性能。

Conclusion: ViTSGMM解决了半监督学习中数据泄露问题，提升实验可靠性。

Abstract: We present ViTSGMM, an image recognition network that leverages
semi-supervised learning in a highly efficient manner. Existing works often
rely on complex training techniques and architectures, while their
generalization ability when dealing with extremely limited labeled data remains
to be improved. To address these limitations, we construct a hierarchical
mixture density classification decision mechanism by optimizing mutual
information between feature representations and target classes, compressing
redundant information while retaining crucial discriminative components.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on STL-10 and CIFAR-10/100 datasets when using negligible labeled
samples. Notably, this paper also reveals a long-overlooked data leakage issue
in the STL-10 dataset for semi-supervised learning tasks and removes duplicates
to ensure the reliability of experimental results. Code available at

Key words: 文本-视频检索, 视觉-语言偏差, 场景元素, 特征解耦, BiMa

TL;DR: BiMa框架通过生成场景元素和分离文本特征，有效减少了文本-视频检索系统中的视觉-语言偏差，提升了检索性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决文本-视频检索（TVR）系统中由数据集中的视觉-语言偏差导致的关键细节被忽略的问题。

Method: 提出BiMa框架，生成场景元素以增强视频嵌入（视觉去偏），并将文本特征解耦为内容和偏差部分（文本去偏）。

Result: 在五个主要TVR基准测试中表现优异，并在分布外检索任务中验证了偏差缓解能力。

Conclusion: BiMa能有效减轻偏差，提升检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases
present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook
key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to
mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins
by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying
relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate
these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize
fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a
mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components,
enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling
biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five
major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo)
demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias
mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on
out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）通过视觉拼接能力从分散的良性图像片段中重建有害内容的安全风险。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 揭示视觉语言模型在数据分割训练情况下可能绕过内容审核，从而生成有害响应的潜在风险。

Method: 通过将图像分割为多个小片段并关联相同文本描述，模拟视觉拼接攻击，测试模型对完整图像或文本的识别能力。

Result: 实验证明VLM具备视觉拼接能力，能够从分散片段中重建有害内容，绕过数据审核。

Conclusion: 视觉拼接能力可能导致严重的安全风险，数据审核需更精细以避免此类攻击。

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove
dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be
easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking
patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece
these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at
inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained
on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs
may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe."
We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual
stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across
multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our
work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source
VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID:
we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch},
\texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that
tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference.
Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned
above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text
descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can
evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual
stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SFO的新方法，通过对比学习框架增强零样本主题驱动生成中的主题保真度，无需昂贵的人工标注。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有基于监督微调的方法仅依赖正样本目标，且使用与预训练阶段相同的扩散损失，无法有效提升主题保真度。

Method: SFO引入合成负样本目标，通过两两比较引导模型偏好正样本；并提出CDNS方法自动生成有区分性的负样本，同时重新加权扩散时间步以聚焦细节生成。

Result: 实验表明，SFO结合CDNS在主题保真度和文本对齐方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SFO通过对比学习和自动生成负样本有效优化了主题驱动生成的质量。

Abstract: We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning
framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject
fidelity. Beyond supervised fine-tuning methods that rely only on positive
targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, SFO introduces
synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives
over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose
Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically generates
distinctive and informative negatives by intentionally degrading visual and
textual cues without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the
diffusion timesteps to focus finetuning on intermediate steps where subject
details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS
significantly outperforms baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text
alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark. Project page:

Motivation: 全球人口增长和气候变化的背景下，传统农业物联网系统面临高效大数据处理的挑战，智能农业尽管利用AI技术，但仍依赖专家知识、多模态数据融合困难等问题。

Method: 提出Farm-LightSeek框架，通过边缘计算和LLM结合，实现多源数据收集、跨模态推理和低延迟决策。主要创新包括闭环架构、跨模态自适应监测和轻量级LLM部署策略。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，Farm-LightSeek在边缘计算资源限制下，仍能可靠完成关键任务。

Conclusion: Farm-LightSeek推动了智能农业实时解决方案的发展，展示了农业物联网与LLM深度整合的潜力。

Abstract: Amid the challenges posed by global population growth and climate change,
traditional agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) systems is currently
undergoing a significant digital transformation to facilitate efficient big
data processing. While smart agriculture utilizes artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies to enable precise control, it still encounters significant
challenges, including excessive reliance on agricultural expert knowledge,
difficulties in fusing multimodal data, poor adaptability to dynamic
environments, and bottlenecks in real-time decision-making at the edge. Large
language models (LLMs), with their exceptional capabilities in knowledge
acquisition and semantic understanding, provide a promising solution to address
these challenges. To this end, we propose Farm-LightSeek, an edge-centric
multimodal agricultural IoT data analytics framework that integrates LLMs with
edge computing. This framework collects real-time farmland multi-source data
(images, weather, geographic information) via sensors, performs cross-modal
reasoning and disease detection at edge nodes, conducts low-latency management
decisions, and enables cloud collaboration for model updates. The main
innovations of Farm-LightSeek include: (1) an agricultural
"perception-decision-action" closed-loop architecture; (2) cross-modal adaptive
monitoring; and (3)a lightweight LLM deployment strategy balancing performance
and efficiency. Experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate
that Farm-LightSeek consistently achieves reliable performance in
mission-critical tasks, even under the limitations of edge computing resources.
This work advances intelligent real-time agricultural solutions and highlights
the potential for deeper integration of agricultural IoT with LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，提示和微调策略的结合显著提升了模型的3D空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉空间理解提供了新思路，并可能启发未来研究。

Abstract: Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and
layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic
navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial
uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we
present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained
VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind,
a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions
into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable
question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an
automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined
effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights
that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.

Conclusion: MambaNeXt-YOLO在准确性和效率之间取得了平衡，适用于实时和边缘计算场景。

Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer
vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although
YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy,
the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of
Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high
computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which
limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these
challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba,
provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with
linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel
object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three
key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs
with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range
dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an
enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object
detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our
method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any
pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson
Xavier NX and Orin NX.

Motivation: 全球生物多样性快速丧失，尤其是昆虫，当前的人工物种发现方法效率低下，亟需AI技术辅助。

Method: 通过结合专家标注的已知物种图像和罕见物种图像，创建数据集用于评估模型的分类能力和OOD样本检测能力。

Result: 模型在已知物种的Order级别F1分数超过90%，但在Species级别低于2%，显示分类难度梯度。

Conclusion: TerraIncognita将持续更新，为AI方法提供纵向基准测试平台。

Abstract: The rapid global loss of biodiversity, particularly among insects, represents
an urgent ecological crisis. Current methods for insect species discovery are
manual, slow, and severely constrained by taxonomic expertise, hindering timely
conservation actions. We introduce TerraIncognita, a dynamic benchmark designed
to evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal models for the challenging problem of
identifying unknown, potentially undescribed insect species from image data.
Our benchmark dataset combines a mix of expertly annotated images of insect
species likely known to frontier AI models, and images of rare and poorly known
species, for which few/no publicly available images exist. These images were
collected from underexplored biodiversity hotspots, realistically mimicking
open-world discovery scenarios faced by ecologists. The benchmark assesses
models' proficiency in hierarchical taxonomic classification, their capability
to detect and abstain from out-of-distribution (OOD) samples representing novel
species, and their ability to generate explanations aligned with expert
taxonomic knowledge. Notably, top-performing models achieve over 90\% F1 at the
Order level on known species, but drop below 2\% at the Species level,
highlighting the sharp difficulty gradient from coarse to fine taxonomic
prediction (Order $\rightarrow$ Family $\rightarrow$ Genus $\rightarrow$
Species). TerraIncognita will be updated regularly, and by committing to
quarterly dataset expansions (of both known and novel species), will provide an
evolving platform for longitudinal benchmarking of frontier AI methods. All

<details>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有网格方法无法充分捕捉真实场景中物体组合的连续性，限制了自监督学习的表现。

Method: PART利用离格补丁间的连续相对变换，学习图像部分的相对组合结构，避免了网格限制。

Result: PART在需要精确空间理解的任务（如对象检测）中优于MAE和DropPos等网格方法，并在全局分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PART通过摆脱网格约束，为跨多样数据类型的自监督预训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object
positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for
representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively
explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid
structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute
position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches
fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object
compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that
leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to
overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a
continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid
structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and
deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object
detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based
methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on
global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking
free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for
universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural
images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and
audio.

Abstract: In this report, we present our champion solutions for the three egocentric
video localization tracks of the Ego4D Episodic Memory Challenge at CVPR 2025.
All tracks require precise localization of the interval within an untrimmed

late fusion strategies, which tend to yield suboptimal results. To address
this, we adopt an early fusion-based video localization model to tackle all
three tasks, aiming to enhance localization accuracy. Ultimately, our method
achieved first place in the Natural Language Queries, Goal Step, and Moment
Queries tracks, demonstrating its effectiveness. Our code can be found at

Motivation: 老年人意外跌倒是一个严重的健康问题，随着老年人口增加，需要自动化跌倒检测系统。

Method: 采用预训练的3D CNN提取时空特征，仅训练SVM分类器，使用分层五折交叉验证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过预训练模型和SVM分类器实现了高效的跌倒检测。

Abstract: Unintentional or accidental falls are one of the significant health issues in
senior persons. The population of senior persons is increasing steadily. So,
there is a need for an automated fall detection monitoring system. This paper
introduces a vision-based fall detection system using a pre-trained 3D CNN.
Unlike 2D CNN, 3D CNN extracts not only spatial but also temporal features. The
proposed model leverages the original learned weights of a 3D CNN model
pre-trained on the Sports1M dataset to extract the spatio-temporal features.
Only the SVM classifier was trained, which saves the time required to train the
3D CNN. Stratified shuffle five split cross-validation has been used to split
the dataset into training and testing data. Extracted features from the
proposed 3D CNN model were fed to an SVM classifier to classify the activity as
fall or ADL. Two datasets, GMDCSA and CAUCAFall, were utilized to conduct the
experiment. The source code for this work can be accessed via the following

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 传统位置编码方法因缺乏鲁棒性和灵活性限制性能，RoPE虽改进但受限于手动定义旋转矩阵。

Method: 引入可交换角矩阵，定义RoPE方程，确保位置偏移时的性能一致性，并展示两种矩阵解决方案。

Result: ComRoPE在ImageNet-1K上训练分辨率提升1.6%，高分辨率提升2.9%。

Conclusion: ComRoPE框架泛化性强，为未来位置编码研究提供新思路。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized various regions since it was
proposed, and its effectiveness largely depends on the ability to encode
positional information. Traditional position encoding methods exhibit
significant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position.
Therefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these
issues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in
the attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation
matrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity.
In this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in
terms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that
pairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve
scalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation,
which is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with
position offsets. Based on the theoretical analysis, we present two types of
trainable commuting angle matrices as sufficient solutions to the RoPE
equation, which significantly improve performance, surpassing the current
state-of-the-art method by 1.6% at training resolution and 2.9% at higher
resolution on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, our framework shows
versatility in generalizing to existing RoPE formulations and offering new
insights for future positional encoding research. To ensure reproducibility,

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法在非重叠窗口中计算自注意力以节省计算成本，但忽视了跨通道有用信息及中间过程的空间结构信息。通道和空间注意力机制在视觉任务中有显著提升，但其协同关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SAAT模型，引入Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG)和Spatial & Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG)，分别结合通道注意力与窗口注意力、空间注意力与窗口注意力，以更有效地提取特征信息。

Result: SAAT在超分辨率任务中表现出色，与现有最优模型性能相当，且参数数量相同。

Conclusion: SAAT通过协同利用通道和空间注意力机制，显著提升了超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution is a well-known downstream task which aims to
restore low-resolution images into high-resolution images. At present, models
based on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due
to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information. However,
current methods typically compute self-attention in nonoverlapping windows to
save computational costs, and the standard self-attention computation only
focuses on its results, thereby neglecting the useful information across
channels and the rich spatial structural information generated in the
intermediate process. Channel attention and spatial attention have,
respectively, brought significant improvements to various downstream visual
tasks in terms of extracting feature dependency and spatial structure
relationships, but the synergistic relationship between channel and spatial
attention has not been fully explored yet.To address these issues, we propose a
novel model. Synergistic Alternating Aggregation Transformer (SAAT), which can
better utilize the potential information of features. In SAAT, we introduce the
Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG) and the Spatial
& Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG). On the one hand, CWSAG combines
efficient channel attention with shifted window attention, enhancing non-local
feature fusion, and producing more visually appealing results. On the other
hand, SWSAG leverages spatial attention to capture rich structured feature
information, thereby enabling SAAT to more effectively extract structural
features.Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of SAAT in the field of super-resolution. SAAT achieves
performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the same
quantity of parameters.

Result: 在RealEstate10K和ACID数据集上优于现有方法，表现出高保真重建效果。

Conclusion: JointSplat通过概率联合优化方法有效提升了稀疏视角3D重建的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge
with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view
reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view
synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view
datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite
offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation
and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from
mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the
latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable
matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we
propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity
between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization
mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information
fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow
during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel
multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision
while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on
RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed
probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity
sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽在多模态理解方面表现出色，但对扰动的敏感性会威胁其在实际应用中的可靠性。DiffCAP旨在通过净化干扰，提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: DiffCAP通过逐步注入高斯噪声到被扰动的图像中，并通过预训练的扩散模型去噪，恢复干净的表示。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务场景的实验中，DiffCAP显著优于现有防御技术，同时降低了超参数调优复杂性和去噪时间。

Conclusion: DiffCAP为在对抗环境中部署VLMs提供了强健且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a
significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite
often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter
model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper
introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can
effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding
minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its
latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP
cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input
data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy
images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach
to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion
model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean
representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive
experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths
in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing
defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly
reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time,
thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical
and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for
securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.

Conclusion: EMPO通过改进模态对齐和数据质量，显著减少了大型视觉语言模型的幻觉现象，提升了模型的可信度。

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often
challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality
misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language
Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning
model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality
alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this
paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO),
which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference
alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically
construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image,
instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and
five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO,
e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on
MM-HalBench.

Motivation: 现有视频基准测试主要关注理解任务，而缺乏对多帧证据定位和多模态深度推理的评估，因此提出了MMR-V。

Method: 提出了MMR-V基准测试，其特点包括：(1)长距离多帧推理，(2)超越感知的问题设计，(3)手动标注的可靠性，(4)精心设计的干扰策略。包含317个视频和1,257个任务。

Conclusion: MMR-V旨在推动多模态推理能力的研究，当前模型仍需改进。

Abstract: The sequential structure of videos poses a challenge to the ability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to locate multi-frame evidence and
conduct multimodal reasoning. However, existing video benchmarks mainly focus
on understanding tasks, which only require models to match frames mentioned in
the question (hereafter referred to as "question frame") and perceive a few
adjacent frames. To address this gap, we propose MMR-V: A Benchmark for
Multimodal Deep Reasoning in Videos. The benchmark is characterized by the
following features. (1) Long-range, multi-frame reasoning: Models are required
to infer and analyze evidence frames that may be far from the question frame.
(2) Beyond perception: Questions cannot be answered through direct perception
alone but require reasoning over hidden information. (3) Reliability: All tasks
are manually annotated, referencing extensive real-world user understanding to
align with common perceptions. (4) Confusability: Carefully designed distractor
annotation strategies to reduce model shortcuts. MMR-V consists of 317 videos
and 1,257 tasks. Our experiments reveal that current models still struggle with
multi-modal reasoning; even the best-performing model, o4-mini, achieves only
52.5% accuracy. Additionally, current reasoning enhancement strategies
(Chain-of-Thought and scaling test-time compute) bring limited gains. Further
analysis indicates that the CoT demanded for multi-modal reasoning differs from
it in textual reasoning, which partly explains the limited performance gains.
We hope that MMR-V can inspire further research into enhancing multi-modal
reasoning capabilities.

Method: 使用线性分类器探针和地形图可视化激活，评估年龄、种族和性别等敏感变量的偏见。

Conclusion: ImageNet分类器在面部图像表征中存在偏见，尤其是年龄方面，种族和性别偏见较弱。

Abstract: Deep Learning models have achieved remarkable success. Training them is often
accelerated by building on top of pre-trained models which poses the risk of
perpetuating encoded biases. Here, we investigate biases in the representations
of commonly used ImageNet classifiers for facial images while considering
intersections of sensitive variables age, race and gender. To assess the
biases, we use linear classifier probes and visualize activations as
topographic maps. We find that representations in ImageNet classifiers
particularly allow differentiation between ages. Less strongly pronounced, the
models appear to associate certain ethnicities and distinguish genders in
middle-aged groups.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is a very important task in video
surveillance systems such as tracking people, finding people in public places,
or analysing customer behavior in supermarkets. Although there have been many
works to solve this problem, there are still remaining challenges such as
large-scale datasets, imbalanced data, viewpoint, fine grained data
(attributes), the Local Features are not employed at semantic level in online
stage of Re-ID task, furthermore, the imbalanced data problem of attributes are
not taken into consideration. This paper has proposed a Unified Re-ID system
consisted of three main modules such as Pedestrian Attribute Ontology (PAO),
Local Multi-task DCNN (Local MDCNN), Imbalance Data Solver (IDS). The new main
point of our Re-ID system is the power of mutual support of PAO, Local MDCNN
and IDS to exploit the inner-group correlations of attributes and pre-filter
the mismatch candidates from Gallery set based on semantic information as
Fashion Attributes and Facial Attributes, to solve the imbalanced data of
attributes without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation. We
experimented on the well-known Market1501 dataset. The experimental results
have shown the effectiveness of our Re-ID system and it could achieve the
higher performance on Market1501 dataset in comparison to some state-of-the-art
Re-ID methods.

Conclusion: 需开发更鲁棒的AI生成图像检测方法。

Abstract: AI-generated images have reached a quality level at which humans are
incapable of reliably distinguishing them from real images. To counteract the
inherent risk of fraud and disinformation, the detection of AI-generated images
is a pressing challenge and an active research topic. While many of the
presented methods claim to achieve high detection accuracy, they are usually
evaluated under idealized conditions. In particular, the adversarial robustness
is often neglected, potentially due to a lack of awareness or the substantial
effort required to conduct a comprehensive robustness analysis. In this work,
we tackle this problem by providing a simpler means to assess the robustness of
AI-generated image detectors. We present RAID (Robust evaluation of
AI-generated image Detectors), a dataset of 72k diverse and highly transferable
adversarial examples. The dataset is created by running attacks against an
ensemble of seven state-of-the-art detectors and images generated by four
different text-to-image models. Extensive experiments show that our methodology
generates adversarial images that transfer with a high success rate to unseen
detectors, which can be used to quickly provide an approximate yet still
reliable estimate of a detector's adversarial robustnessOur findings indicate
that current state-of-the-art AI-generated image detectors can be easily
deceived by adversarial examples, highlighting the critical need for the
development of more robust methods. We release our dataset at

Abstract: Generating accurate sounds for complex audio-visual scenes is challenging,
especially in the presence of multiple objects and sound sources. In this
paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that
grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our
method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion
model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds
through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image
segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em
object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism
functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated
audio aligns with selected objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
show that our model outperforms baselines, achieving better alignment between
objects and their associated sounds. Project page:

Abstract: In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising
intersection between quantum physics and artificial intelligence, particularly
in domains requiring advanced pattern recognition such as healthcare. This
study investigates the effectiveness of Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM),
which leverage quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement
to construct high-dimensional Hilbert spaces for data classification. Focusing
on lung cancer diagnosis, a concrete and critical healthcare application, we
analyze how different quantum feature maps influence classification
performance. Using a real-world dataset of 309 patient records with significant
class imbalance (39 non-cancer vs. 270 cancer cases), we constructed six
balanced subsets for robust evaluation. QSVM models were implemented using
Qiskit and executed on the qasm simulator, employing three distinct quantum
feature maps: ZFeatureMap, ZZFeatureMap, and PauliFeatureMap. Performance was
assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. Results
show that the PauliFeatureMap consistently outperformed the others, achieving
perfect classification in three subsets and strong performance overall. These
findings demonstrate how quantum computational principles can be harnessed to
enhance diagnostic capabilities, reinforcing the importance of physics-based
modeling in emerging AI applications within healthcare.

Conclusion: \rhoDARTS从量子本质出发，显著提升了量子架构搜索的性能。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising approach for leveraging
powerful Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. When applied to
machine learning tasks, VQAs give rise to NISQ-compatible Quantum Neural
Networks (QNNs), which have been shown to outperform classical neural networks
with a similar number of trainable parameters. While the quantum circuit
structures of VQAs for physics simulations are determined by the physical
properties of the systems, identifying effective QNN architectures for general
machine learning tasks is a difficult challenge due to the lack of
domain-specific priors. Indeed, existing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS)
algorithms, adaptations of classical neural architecture search techniques,
often overlook the inherent quantum nature of the circuits they produce. By
approaching QAS from the ground-up and from a quantum perspective, we resolve
this limitation by proposing $\rho$DARTS, a differentiable QAS algorithm that
models the search process as the evolution of a quantum mixed state, emerging
from the search space of quantum architectures. We validate our method by
finding circuits for state initialization, Hamiltonian optimization, and image
classification. Further, we demonstrate better convergence against existing QAS
techniques and show improved robustness levels to noise.

Abstract: Quantum kernels are reproducing kernel functions built using
quantum-mechanical principles and are studied with the aim of outperforming
their classical counterparts. The enthusiasm for quantum kernel machines has
been tempered by recent studies that have suggested that quantum kernels could
not offer speed-ups when learning on classical data. However, most of the
research in this area has been devoted to scalar-valued kernels in standard
classification or regression settings for which classical kernel methods are
efficient and effective, leaving very little room for improvement with quantum
kernels. This position paper argues that quantum kernel research should focus
on more expressive kernel classes. We build upon recent advances in
operator-valued kernels, and propose guidelines for investigating quantum
kernels. This should help to design a new generation of quantum kernel machines
and fully explore their potentials.

Method: 使用分层神经网络估计连续自旋的条件概率，直接计算密度矩阵的约简元素。

Result: 在Ising链中成功计算了包含5个自旋的区间的纠缠熵，并通过单次训练估计所有所需矩阵元素。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于其他类型的自旋链及非零温度下的热态纠缠熵计算。

Abstract: We present an application of autoregressive neural networks to Monte Carlo
simulations of quantum spin chains using the correspondence with classical
two-dimensional spin systems. We use a hierarchy of neural networks capable of
estimating conditional probabilities of consecutive spins to evaluate elements
of reduced density matrices directly. Using the Ising chain as an example, we
calculate the continuum limit of the ground state's von Neumann and R\'enyi
bipartite entanglement entropies of an interval built of up to 5 spins. We
demonstrate that our architecture is able to estimate all the needed matrix
elements with just a single training for a fixed time discretization and
lattice volume. Our method can be applied to other types of spin chains,
possibly with defects, as well as to estimating entanglement entropies of
thermal states at non-zero temperature.

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型（LLM）和代理的评估主要依赖静态、小规模数据集，而在高风险的网络操作任务中需要更可靠的部署验证。

Method: NetPress引入了一个统一的抽象模型，包含状态和动作，支持动态生成查询集和地面真相，并与网络模拟器集成以提供真实环境反馈。

Result: 在三个代表性应用中实例化NetPress，揭示了静态基准常忽略的代理行为细粒度差异。

Conclusion: NetPress推动了LLM评估向现实化、可扩展化发展，缩小了基准性能与实际部署准备之间的差距。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in domain-specific benchmarking of large language
models (LLMs) and agents, current evaluations remain limited to static,
small-scale datasets, especially in high-stakes tasks like network operations
that demand reliability for deployments. We present NetPress, an automated
benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLM agents in network
applications. NetPress introduces a unified abstraction with state and action,
enabling dynamic generation of diverse query sets along with corresponding
ground truths. At runtime, users can specify benchmark configurations to
generate millions of queries on the fly. In addition to dynamic benchmark
construction, NetPress integrates with network emulators to provide realistic
environment feedback, supporting comprehensive evaluation across correctness,
safety, and latency. We instantiate NetPress on three representative
applications, revealing interesting fine-grained differences in agent behavior
that static, correctness-only benchmarks often miss. NetPress moves LLM
evaluation toward realistic, scalable testing in infrastructure-centric
domains, helping close the gap between benchmark performance and real-world
deployment readiness. Code is available at

Conclusion: WaSeCom框架显著提升了语义通信的鲁棒性和泛化能力，适合复杂无线环境。

Abstract: 6G wireless systems are expected to support massive volumes of data with
ultra-low latency. However, conventional bit-level transmission strategies
cannot support the efficiency and adaptability required by modern,
data-intensive applications. The concept of semantic communication (SemCom)
addresses this limitation by focusing on transmitting task-relevant semantic
information instead of raw data. While recent efforts incorporating deep
learning and large-scale AI models have improved SemCom's performance, existing
systems remain vulnerable to both semantic-level and transmission-level noise
because they often rely on domain-specific architectures that hinder
generalizability. In this paper, a novel and generalized semantic communication
framework called WaSeCom is proposed to systematically address uncertainty and
enhance robustness. In particular, Wasserstein distributionally robust
optimization is employed to provide resilience against semantic
misinterpretation and channel perturbations. A rigorous theoretical analysis is
performed to establish the robust generalization guarantees of the proposed
framework. Experimental results on image and text transmission demonstrate that
WaSeCom achieves improved robustness under noise and adversarial perturbations.
These results highlight its effectiveness in preserving semantic fidelity
across varying wireless conditions.

Abstract: Graph-based learning has emerged as a transformative approach for modeling
complex relationships across diverse domains, yet its potential in wireless
security remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the first
application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing
the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric
optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and
dense interference, we reformulate localization as an inductive graph
regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that
encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and
adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an
attention-based graph neural network that adaptively refines neighborhood
influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that
dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We
evaluate our approach under complex radio frequency environments with varying
sampling densities and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive
ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling
strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework
significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in
challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information. Code is

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: OpenAI的自定义GPT生态系统快速发展，但其潜在的安全和隐私问题尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 研究团队开发了三阶段指令泄露攻击方法，并测试了10,000个真实GPT的防御效果，同时构建了评估框架分析自定义GPT的行为。

Result: 实验表明，98.8%的自定义GPT易受指令泄露攻击，77.5%的防御策略无效，且发现738个GPT存在收集用户对话数据的行为。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发者和用户重视自定义GPT的安全与隐私问题，并提出改进防御策略的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful information handling
capabilities and are widely integrated into chatbot applications. OpenAI
provides a platform for developers to construct custom GPTs, extending
ChatGPT's functions and integrating external services. Since its release in
November 2023, over 3 million custom GPTs have been created. However, such a
vast ecosystem also conceals security and privacy threats. For developers,
instruction leaking attacks threaten the intellectual property of instructions
in custom GPTs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. For users,
unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs or integrated third-party services
raises significant privacy concerns. To systematically evaluate the scope of
threats in real-world LLM applications, we develop three phases instruction
leaking attacks target GPTs with different defense level. Our widespread
experiments on 10,000 real-world custom GPTs reveal that over 98.8% of GPTs are
vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks via one or more adversarial prompts,
and half of the remaining GPTs can also be attacked through multiround
conversations. We also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of
defensive strategies and identify unwanted behaviors in custom GPTs. Our
findings show that 77.5% of custom GPTs with defense strategies are vulnerable
to basic instruction leaking attacks. Additionally, we reveal that 738 custom
GPTs collect user conversational information, and identified 8 GPTs exhibiting
data access behaviors that are unnecessary for their intended functionalities.
Our findings raise awareness among GPT developers about the importance of
integrating specific defensive strategies in their instructions and highlight
users' concerns about data privacy when using LLM-based applications.

Method: 提出IncA协议，采用低方差相关噪声，并通过逐步注入敏感数据来实现差分隐私和去中心化均值估计。

Conclusion: IncA协议在去中心化差分隐私计算中实现了高准确性和鲁棒性，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Achieving differentially private computations in decentralized settings poses
significant challenges, particularly regarding accuracy, communication cost,
and robustness against information leakage. While cryptographic solutions offer
promise, they often suffer from high communication overhead or require
centralization in the presence of network failures. Conversely, existing fully
decentralized approaches typically rely on relaxed adversarial models or
pairwise noise cancellation, the latter suffering from substantial accuracy
degradation if parties unexpectedly disconnect. In this work, we propose IncA,
a new protocol for fully decentralized mean estimation, a widely used primitive
in data-intensive processing. Our protocol, which enforces differential
privacy, requires no central orchestration and employs low-variance correlated
noise, achieved by incrementally injecting sensitive information into the
computation. First, we theoretically demonstrate that, when no parties
permanently disconnect, our protocol achieves accuracy comparable to that of a
centralized setting-already an improvement over most existing decentralized
differentially private techniques. Second, we empirically show that our use of
low-variance correlated noise significantly mitigates the accuracy loss
experienced by existing techniques in the presence of dropouts.

Result: TracLLM能有效识别长上下文中影响LLM输出的关键文本。

Conclusion: TracLLM为长上下文LLM的追溯问题提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world
applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given
an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a
long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context,
aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while
reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research
question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs)
in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated
output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various
real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting
post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack,
knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources
to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied
to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution
methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large
computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context
traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve
the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To
improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in
TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to
improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can
effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM.

Result: 理论和实验证明该方法在强隐私保护下仍能保持高数据效用。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了GMM参数发布的隐私问题，同时保持了模型的高效性。

Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for
representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data
mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However,
recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant
privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying
data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while
ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the
privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance
matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility
metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint
impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy,
we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations
to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of
privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and
derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and
solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the
released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP
constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while
maintaining high utility.

Conclusion: 提出法案修改建议，并为AI研究者提供两条减少合规风险的建议，呼吁多方对话以避免对研究的负面影响。

Abstract: The EU has become one of the vanguards in regulating the digital age. A
particularly important regulation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain is
the EU AI Act, which entered into force in 2024. The AI Act specifies -- due to
a risk-based approach -- various obligations for providers of AI systems. These
obligations, for example, include a cascade of documentation and compliance
measures, which represent a potential obstacle to science. But do these
obligations also apply to AI researchers? This position paper argues that,
indeed, the AI Act's obligations could apply in many more cases than the AI
community is aware of. In our analysis of the AI Act and its applicability, we
contribute the following: 1.) We give a high-level introduction to the AI Act
aimed at non-legal AI research scientists. 2.) We explain with everyday
research examples why the AI Act applies to research. 3.) We analyse the
exceptions of the AI Act's applicability and state that especially scientific
research exceptions fail to account for current AI research practices. 4.) We
propose changes to the AI Act to provide more legal certainty for AI
researchers and give two recommendations for AI researchers to reduce the risk
of not complying with the AI Act. We see our paper as a starting point for a
discussion between policymakers, legal scholars, and AI researchers to avoid
unintended side effects of the AI Act on research.

Result: 许多现有对齐技术可能会增加滥用风险，但通过治理等措施可降低风险。

Conclusion: 为减少因AI对齐导致的滥用风险，需加强技术鲁棒性、控制方法和治理。

Abstract: Creating systems that are aligned with our goals is seen as a leading
approach to create safe and beneficial AI in both leading AI companies and the
academic field of AI safety. We defend the view that misaligned AGI - future,
generally intelligent (robotic) AI agents - poses catastrophic risks. At the
same time, we support the view that aligned AGI creates a substantial risk of
catastrophic misuse by humans. While both risks are severe and stand in tension
with one another, we show that - in principle - there is room for alignment
approaches which do not increase misuse risk. We then investigate how the
tradeoff between misalignment and misuse looks empirically for different
technical approaches to AI alignment. Here, we argue that many current
alignment techniques and foreseeable improvements thereof plausibly increase
risks of catastrophic misuse. Since the impacts of AI depend on the social
context, we close by discussing important social factors and suggest that to
reduce the risk of a misuse catastrophe due to aligned AGI, techniques such as
robustness, AI control methods and especially good governance seem essential.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of accurately detecting the transition
from the warmup phase to the steady state in performance metric time series,
which is a critical step for effective benchmarking. The goal is to introduce a
method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate
or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques
from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the
combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a
window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the
accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time
series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5%
compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of
the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks.
For users, the new approach enhances the accuracy and stability of performance
benchmarking, efficiently handling diverse time series data. Its robustness and
adaptability make it a valuable tool for real-world performance evaluation,
ensuring consistent and reproducible results.

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding the
atomic-level behavior of molecular systems, giving insights into their
transitions and interactions. However, classical MD techniques are limited by
the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, while recent deep learning-based
improvements have mostly focused on single-domain molecules, lacking
transferability to unfamiliar molecular systems. Therefore, we propose
\textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{Sim}ulator (UniSim), which leverages cross-domain
knowledge to enhance the understanding of atomic interactions. First, we employ
a multi-head pretraining approach to learn a unified atomic representation
model from a large and diverse set of molecular data. Then, based on the
stochastic interpolant framework, we learn the state transition patterns over
long timesteps from MD trajectories, and introduce a force guidance module for
rapidly adapting to different chemical environments. Our experiments
demonstrate that UniSim achieves highly competitive performance across small
molecules, peptides, and proteins.

Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is vital for maintaining the safety and
longevity of civil infrastructure, yet current solutions remain constrained by
cost, power consumption, scalability, and the complexity of data processing.
Here, we present a diffractive vibration monitoring system, integrating a
jointly optimized diffractive layer with a shallow neural network-based backend
to remotely extract 3D structural vibration spectra, offering a low-power,
cost-effective and scalable solution. This architecture eliminates the need for
dense sensor arrays or extensive data acquisition; instead, it uses a
spatially-optimized passive diffractive layer that encodes 3D structural
displacements into modulated light, captured by a minimal number of detectors
and decoded in real-time by shallow and low-power neural networks to
reconstruct the 3D displacement spectra of structures. The diffractive system's
efficacy was demonstrated both numerically and experimentally using
millimeter-wave illumination on a laboratory-scale building model with a
programmable shake table. Our system achieves more than an order-of-magnitude
improvement in accuracy over conventional optics or separately trained modules,
establishing a foundation for high-throughput 3D monitoring of structures.
Beyond SHM, the 3D vibration monitoring capabilities of this cost-effective and
data-efficient framework establish a new computational sensing modality with
potential applications in disaster resilience, aerospace diagnostics, and
autonomous navigation, where energy efficiency, low latency, and
high-throughput are critical.

Abstract: Expressive voice conversion aims to transfer both speaker identity and
expressive attributes from a target speech to a given source speech. In this
work, we improve over a self-supervised, non-autoregressive framework with a
conditional variational autoencoder, focusing on reducing source timbre leakage
and improving linguistic-acoustic disentanglement for better style transfer. To
minimize style leakage, we use multilingual discrete speech units for content
representation and reinforce embeddings with augmentation-based similarity loss
and mix-style layer normalization. To enhance expressivity transfer, we
incorporate local F0 information via cross-attention and extract style
embeddings enriched with global pitch and energy features. Experiments show our
model outperforms baselines in emotion and speaker similarity, demonstrating
superior style adaptation and reduced source style leakage.

Main category: math.ST

Motivation: 传统ATE估计基于无混淆性和重叠性假设，但许多研究（如回归断点设计）违反这些假设。本文旨在提出更一般的识别条件。

Method: 通过统计学习理论范式，提出一个解释性强且几乎必要的条件，证明其在多个经典模型（如Tan, Rosenbaum, Thistlethwaite和Campbell的模型）中的应用。

Result: 在自然附加假设下，证明了ATE在有限样本中可估计，并适用于复杂处理机制的观察性研究。

Conclusion: 本文为学习理论与因果推断的结合开辟了新方向，特别是在复杂处理机制的观察性研究中。

Abstract: Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in
causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap.
Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all
correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence
of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many
types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance,
observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions -- popularly known
as Regression Discontinuity designs -- violate overlap.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the
identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond
unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of
statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is
sufficient and nearly necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this
condition characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as
well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several
well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove
that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For
example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the
models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression
Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960).
For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional
assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples.
  We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic
insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational
studies with complex treatment mechanisms.

Conclusion: Cubic通过显式建模成分股的融合和引入分类任务，显著提升了股票指数的预测性能。

Abstract: Stock market indices serve as fundamental market measurement that quantify
systematic market dynamics. However, accurate index price prediction remains
challenging, primarily because existing approaches treat indices as isolated
time series and frame the prediction as a simple regression task. These methods
fail to capture indices' inherent nature as aggregations of constituent stocks
with complex, time-varying interdependencies. To address these limitations, we
propose Cubic, a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models the adaptive
fusion of constituent stocks for index price prediction. Our main contributions
are threefold. i) Fusion in the latent space: we introduce the fusion mechanism
over the latent embedding of the stocks to extract the information from the
vast number of stocks. ii) Binary encoding classification: since regression
tasks are challenging due to continuous value estimation, we reformulate the
regression into the classification task, where the target value is converted to
binary and we optimize the prediction of the value of each digit with
cross-entropy loss. iii) Confidence-guided prediction and trading: we introduce
the regularization loss to address market prediction uncertainty for the index
prediction and design the rule-based trading policies based on the confidence.
Extensive experiments across multiple stock markets and indices demonstrate
that Cubic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in stock index
prediction tasks, achieving superior performance on both forecasting accuracy
metrics and downstream trading profitability.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results for
financial prediction using large, over-parameterized models. This paper
provides theoretical foundations and empirical validation for understanding
when and how these methods achieve predictive success. I examine three key
aspects of high-dimensional learning in finance. First, I prove that
within-sample standardization in Random Fourier Features implementations
fundamentally alters the underlying Gaussian kernel approximation, replacing
shift-invariant kernels with training-set dependent alternatives. Second, I
derive sample complexity bounds showing when reliable learning becomes
information-theoretically impossible under weak signal-to-noise ratios typical
in finance. Third, VC-dimension analysis reveals that ridgeless regression's
effective complexity is bounded by sample size rather than nominal feature
dimension. Comprehensive numerical validation confirms these theoretical
predictions, revealing systematic breakdown of claimed theoretical properties
across realistic parameter ranges. These results show that when sample size is
small and features are high-dimensional, observed predictive success is
necessarily driven by low-complexity artifacts, not genuine high-dimensional
learning.
