However, current DL methods apply RBA rules\nfor the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information\nfrom Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly\nwhen the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each\nother. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with\nByzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training\nbegins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During\ntraining, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the\nserver computed from the allocated training data, and the server then\naggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices\nusing RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately\nrecovered at the server to update the global model.

A widely adopted\nstrategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the\nmodel's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers.\nHowever, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely\nreflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As\nbias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from\nthe underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable\nsignal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific\nPrompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing\nperturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These\nrepresentations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful\nview of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically\ngenerates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to\namplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A\ncontrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and\nseparate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic\nbehavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more\nreliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP\nsignificantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination\ndetection benchmarks."}

The semantic\nspace of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional\nvector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and\nbehavioral drift.

The standard\nnext-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment\nrequired for robust, scalable agent coordination.

These units\ninformation are fused into an unified graph structure with a cyclic training\nstrategy, dynamically integrating spatial, functional, and lateral correlations\nto facilitate a holistic, user-invariant representation. Information fusion\nmechanism of GNN-ADG occurs by iteratively cycling through edge topologies\nduring training, allowing the model to refine its understanding of inter-sensor\nrelationships across diverse perspectives. By representing the spatial\nconfiguration of sensors as an unified graph and incorporating adversarial\nlearning, Information Fusion GNN-ADG effectively learns features that\ngeneralize well to unseen users without requiring target user data during\ntraining, making it practical for real-world applications."}

Drawing inspiration from phase-based motion magnification, we first\ndecompose images using invertible transforms-specifically the Complex Steerable\nPyramid-then compute class-conditional gradients in the transformed space.\nRather than iteratively integrating the gradient to trace a full path, we\namplify the one-step gradient to the input and perform a linear extrapolation\nto expose how the model moves from source to target class. By operating in the\nsteerable pyramid domain, these amplified gradients produce semantically\nmeaningful, spatially coherent morphs that highlight the classifier's most\nsensitive directions, giving insight into the geometry of its decision\nboundaries. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat our phase-focused extrapolation yields perceptually aligned, semantically\nmeaningful transformations, offering a novel, interpretable lens into neural\nclassifiers' internal representations."}

However, the very existence of databands and\ntolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We\npropose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a\nhigh-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to\ngenerate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a\nreduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can\ngenerate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second,\nif the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can\nbe updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM\nat whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the\nhigh-fidelity model.

In this work,\nwe present a device-aware inference engine named SpecMemo that can smartly\ncontrol memory allocations at finer levels to enable multi-turn chatbots with\nspeculative decoding on such limited memory devices. Our methodology stems from\ntheoretically modeling memory footprint of speculative decoding to determine a\nlower bound on the required memory budget while retaining speedup. SpecMemo\nempirically acquires a careful balance between minimizing redundant memory\nallocations for rejected candidate tokens and maintaining competitive\nperformance gains from speculation. Notably, with SpecMemo's memory management,\nwe maintain 96% of overall throughput from speculative decoding on MT-Bench,\nwith reduced generation-memory by 65% on single Nvidia Titan RTX. Given\nmultiple constrained GPUs, we build on top of previous speculative decoding\narchitectures to facilitate big-model inference by distributing\nLlama-2-70B-Chat model, on which we provide novel batched speculative decoding\nto increase usability of multiple small server GPUs. This novel framework\ndemonstrates 2x speedup over distributed and batched vanilla decoding with the\nbase model on eight AMD MI250 GPUs. Moreover, inference throughput increases\nremarkably 8x with batch size 10. Our work contributes to democratized LLM\napplications in resource-constrained environments, providing a pathway for\nfaster and cheaper deployment of real-world LLM applications with robust\nperformance."}

However, current DL methods apply RBA rules\nfor the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information\nfrom Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly\nwhen the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each\nother. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with\nByzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training\nbegins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During\ntraining, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the\nserver computed from the allocated training data, and the server then\naggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices\nusing RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately\nrecovered at the server to update the global model.

The performance will\nsurpass the existing baselines after about ten steps of training under six\nbenchmarks."}

Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards\nachieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context\nswitching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic\nforgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned\ntask when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task\ncontexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the\ninterference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper\nintroduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context\nswitching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an\nadditional network that generates the weights of the primary network\ndynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is\ninput-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer\nvision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of\npreviously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks,\nConvolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient\nDescent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding\ndynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in\nenabling continual learning for improved performance."}

For\ninstance, the hyperbolic implicit bias induced by the overparameterization $m\n\\odot w$--though effective in promoting sparsity--can result in a small\neffective learning rate, which slows down convergence. To overcome this\nobstacle, we propose HAM (Hyperbolic Aware Minimization), which alternates\nbetween an optimizer step and a new hyperbolic mirror step. We derive the\nRiemannian gradient flow for its combination with gradient descent, leading to\nimproved convergence and a similar beneficial hyperbolic geometry as $m \\odot\nw$ for feature learning. We provide an interpretation of the the algorithm by\nrelating it to natural gradient descent, and an exact characterization of its\nimplicit bias for underdetermined linear regression. HAM's implicit bias\nconsistently boosts performance--even of dense training, as we demonstrate in\nexperiments across diverse tasks, including vision, graph and node\nclassification, and large language model fine-tuning.

In addition, we introduce a\nflexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C),\nwhich is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the\nperformance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10\nunseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method\nconsistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world\nbenchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities."}

Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may\nincrease its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting\ntokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling."}

To answer these questions, we take a construction-based\napproach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from\nsparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a\nsequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and\nnonlinearly accessible features.

We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for\nLRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building\non these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's\nreasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall,\nour work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and\noffers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities.

Consequently, we propose\nCoral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by\nintegrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional\nelements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics.\nExperiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement\nover conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities\nvalidated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our\ncontributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in\nexisting approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a\nfoundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic\nretrieval."}

We introduce the Trajectory Policy\nGradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown\ntoken-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level\nreward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not,\nfor algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals\nthat widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess\nthe capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical\njustification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way\nfor more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat\ntraining algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level\nreward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of\npopular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and\npractical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new\nalgorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically\ngrounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency,\nand holds promise for broad applicability."}

Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables\nmodels to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize\nRL training and improve model performance.

Through deliberate experimentation with improper\nevaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve\ndeceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are\nviolated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current\napproaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences,\n(2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal\nvalidation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall\noptimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a\nminimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many\nsophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\\% recall despite\nfundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation\nmethodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The\nstudy serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede\narchitectural sophistication, with implications for improving research\npractices across machine learning applications."}

However, optimizing\nthese systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt\nengineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and\nlimited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent\npolicies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL\nalgorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on\nCritic networks, which can cause training instability and increase\ncomputational burden.

MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability\nand reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group\nrollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and\neffectiveness.

RACE-Align systematically\nconstructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support\nand explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO\nalgorithm.

A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively\ngenerates these preference pairs.

We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward\ncoauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio.

We retrofit seven prevailing\ndocument-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we\nevaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection\ntasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct\nfine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models\nshow superior performance and better generalization across domains.

We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers.

This is an important\ndimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that\nthe optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal\nstandalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem\nis not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial,\nand illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the\nproperties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show\nthat finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However,\nwe are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in\nseveral broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be\ndecomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm.\nFinally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an\nalgorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted\nby users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal\ndelegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well."}

We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting\nperformance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed\nproblems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that\nintegrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy\noptimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and\ncritique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration.\nExtensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that\nCritique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based\nfine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general\nreasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%,\nrespectively.

Most existing work\nformulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these\napproaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment,\ninability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the\ndense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of\nvisual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we\npropose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its\ncore, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align\na dedicated <ACTOR> token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the\nmodel to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line\nwith this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the\nmost plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution.\nExtensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art\nmethods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved\ngeneralization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts.

Ideally, the choice of\nthe tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect\nthe probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it\ndoes. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify\none particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a\nsubword (e.g., $\\langle hello \\rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the\nprobability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e.,\n\\textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model\nis trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation\nbias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity\ndesign. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank\nsubwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an\narbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing\nsimilar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation\nconsistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and\ntokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may\nincrease its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting\ntokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling."}
