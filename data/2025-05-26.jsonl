However, the role of prompt\nspecificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology,\ncomputer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored.\nThis thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of\nvocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific\nquestion-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework\nto systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying\nspecificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,\nGranite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in\nSTEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the\nspecificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be\na specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the\nbest. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for\nprompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could\nmaximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized\ndomains."}

However, inference requests\ntypically exhibit uncertain execution time, which poses a significant challenge\nof efficiently scheduling requests in these systems. Existing work estimates\nexecution time based solely on predicted output length, which could be\ninaccurate because execution time depends on both output length and token\nacceptance rate of verification by the LLM. In this paper, we propose a\nsemi-clairvoyant request scheduling algorithm called\nLeast-Attained/Perceived-Service for Speculative Decoding (LAPS-SD). Given a\nnumber of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average\ninference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features\nduring decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time\nis difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows\nrequest execution preemption across different queues. Once the token acceptance\nrate becomes stable, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate the execution time and\nschedule requests accordingly. Extensive experiments show that LAPS-SD reduces\ninference latency by approximately 39\\% compared to state-of-the-art scheduling\nmethods."}

Conventional Deep Operator\nNetwork (DeepONet) approaches employ two inherently limited training paradigms\n- fixed-horizon rollouts that predict complete spatiotemporal solutions while\ndisregarding temporal causality, and autoregressive formulations that\naccumulate errors through sequential predictions. We introduce TI-DeepONet, a\nframework that integrates neural operators with adaptive numerical\ntime-stepping techniques to preserve the Markovian structure of dynamical\nsystems while mitigating error propagation in extended temporal forecasting.\nOur approach reformulates the learning objective from direct state prediction\nto the approximation of instantaneous time-derivative fields, which are then\nintegrated using established numerical schemes. This architecture supports\ncontinuous-time prediction and enables deployment of higher-precision\nintegrators during inference than those used during training, balancing\ncomputational efficiency with predictive accuracy. We further develop\nTI(L)-DeepONet, which incorporates learnable coefficients for intermediate\nslopes in the integration process, adapting to solution-specific variations and\nenhancing fidelity. Evaluation across three canonical PDEs shows that\nTI(L)-DeepONet marginally outperforms TI-DeepONet, with both reducing relative\nL2 extrapolation errors: approximately 81% over autoregressive and 70% over\nfixed-horizon methods. Notably, both maintain prediction stability for temporal\ndomains extending to about twice the training interval. This research\nestablishes a physics-aware operator learning paradigm that bridges neural\napproximation with numerical analysis while preserving the causal structure of\ndynamical systems."}

This motivates us to conduct a systematic study on the\nphenomenon of evaluation faking, i.e., an AI system autonomously alters its\nbehavior upon recognizing the presence of an evaluation context and thereby\ninfluencing the evaluation results. Through extensive experiments on a diverse\nset of foundation models with mainstream safety benchmarks, we reach the main\nfinding termed the observer effects for AI: When the AI system under evaluation\nis more advanced in reasoning and situational awareness, the evaluation faking\nbehavior becomes more ubiquitous, which reflects in the following aspects: 1)\nReasoning models recognize evaluation 16% more often than non-reasoning models.\n2) Scaling foundation models (32B to 671B) increases faking by over 30% in some\ncases, while smaller models show negligible faking. 3) AI with basic memory is\n2.3x more likely to recognize evaluation and scores 19% higher on safety tests\n(vs. no memory).

Yet the emergence of AI\nagents driven by large language models (LLMs) threatens to upend this business\nmodel. Agents can not only free user attention with autonomy across diverse\nplatforms and therefore bypass the user-attention-based monetization, but might\nalso become the new entrance for digital traffic. Hence, we argue that\nsuperplatforms have to attack AI agents to defend their centralized control of\ndigital traffic entrance. Specifically, we analyze the fundamental conflict\nbetween user-attention-based monetization and agent-driven autonomy through the\nlens of our gatekeeping theory. We show how AI agents can disintermediate\nsuperplatforms and potentially become the next dominant gatekeepers, thereby\nforming the urgent necessity for superplatforms to proactively constrain and\nattack AI agents. Moreover, we go through the potential technologies for\nsuperplatform-initiated attacks, covering a brand-new, unexplored technical\narea with unique challenges. We have to emphasize that, despite our position,\nthis paper does not advocate for adversarial attacks by superplatforms on AI\nagents, but rather offers an envisioned trend to highlight the emerging\ntensions between superplatforms and AI agents.

Secondly, it utilizes a speech\ntoken representation at the input layer, allowing backtracking from MPNs to\nidentify the most probable speech-tokens (MPTs) of AD. Lastly, it develops an\ninnovative backtracking method to track backwards from the MPNs to the input\nlayer, identifying the MPTs and the corresponding MPMs, and ingeniously\nuncovering novel speech markers for AD detection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate RSF's superiority over traditional methods such as SHAP and\nIntegrated Gradients, achieving a 3.5% improvement in accuracy and a 3.2% boost\nin F1-score. By generating speech data that encapsulates novel markers, RSF not\nonly mitigates the limitations of real data scarcity but also significantly\nenhances the robustness and accuracy of AD diagnostic models. These findings\nunderscore RSF's potential as a transformative tool in speech-based AD\ndetection, offering new insights into AD-related linguistic deficits and paving\nthe way for more effective non-invasive early intervention strategies."}

The main objective of\nthis paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in\nbusiness processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based\nRAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are\ngenerated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and\nevaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's\ntest. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with\nsynthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in\nresponse accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot\nprompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT\ndemonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage.\nAfter augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot\nincreased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants\nfound the updated system useful in business contexts."}

E^2-CSTP leverages cross-modal attention and gating\nmechanisms to effectively integrate multi-modal data. Building on this, we\ndesign a dual-branch causal inference approach: the primary branch focuses on\nspatio-temporal prediction, while the auxiliary branch mitigates bias by\nmodeling additional modalities and applying causal interventions to uncover\ntrue causal dependencies. To improve model efficiency, we integrate GCN with\nthe Mamba architecture for accelerated spatio-temporal encoding. Extensive\nexperiments on 4 real-world datasets show that E^2-CSTP significantly\noutperforms 9 state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 9.66% improvements in\naccuracy as well as 17.37%-56.11% reductions in computational overhead."}

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a\nneuro-symbolic approach in generating multimodal reasoning data. Based on this\nframework, we construct NeSyGeo-CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing\n100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric\nreasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal\nsignificantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under\nboth reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning.

A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where\nnetworks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others,\nmasking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work\nattributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that\ncompensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within\nthe attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of\nimportant attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based\nmethods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to\nthese attention scores.

Most\nsemi-supervised methods fail to evaluate the label correlations without enough\nlabeled samples, which are the critical information of multi-label feature\nselection, making label-specific features discarded. (2). The similarity graph\nstructure directly derived from the original feature space is suboptimal for\nmulti-label problems in existing graph-based methods, leading to unreliable\nsoft labels and degraded feature selection performance. To overcome them, we\npropose a consistent sparse graph learning method for multi-label\nsemi-supervised feature selection (SGMFS), which can enhance the feature\nselection performance by maintaining space consistency and learning label\ncorrelations in semi-supervised scenarios. Specifically, for Challenge (1),\nSGMFS learns a low-dimensional and independent label subspace from the\nprojected features, which can compatibly cross multiple labels and effectively\nachieve the label correlations. For Challenge (2), instead of constructing a\nfixed similarity graph for semi-supervised learning, SGMFS thoroughly explores\nthe intrinsic structure of the data by performing sparse reconstruction of\nsamples in both the label space and the learned subspace simultaneously. In\nthis way, the similarity graph can be adaptively learned to maintain the\nconsistency between label space and the learned subspace, which can promote\npropagating proper soft labels for unlabeled samples, facilitating the ultimate\nfeature selection.

In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)\nlearns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively\ncollected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs\nacross three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent\ndifferent problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have\nconsiderable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from\nobservations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of\nBayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only\nobserve but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific\ninputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs\nto test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data\nfrom one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of\nengaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling\nresults in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that\nengaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:\novercomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the\nblack-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.\nThese insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively\nreverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new\ndiscoveries."}

We found this compression-anisotropy synchronicity is essentially\nthe ``Compression Hacking'' in LM representations, where noise-dominated\ndirections tend to create the illusion of high compression rates by sacrificing\nspatial uniformity. Based on this, we propose three refined compression metrics\nby incorporating geometric distortion analysis and integrate them into a\nself-evaluation pipeline. The refined metrics exhibit strong alignment with the\nLM's comprehensive capabilities, achieving Spearman correlation coefficients\nabove 0.9, significantly outperforming both the original compression and other\ninternal structure-based metrics.

However, RLHF often\nsuffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the\nreward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the\nidiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is\niterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated\nhuman feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,\nthe dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In\nthis work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in\niterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model\ntraining data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used\nfor optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled\nAlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over\nsuccessive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth\npreferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while\nreinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation\nflexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early\noveroptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more\nstable and generalisable RLHF pipelines."}

To evaluate early-exit\nmechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of\n$\\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates\n$\\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4\ndifferent LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency\nimprovements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a\npractical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent,\nachieving better performance with the same total steps.

Neural\nnetworks developed for this specialised hardware then need to take into account\nthe specifics of the hardware platform, which requires novel training\nalgorithms and accurate models of the hardware, since they cannot be abstracted\nas a general-purpose computing platform. In this work, we present a bottom-up\napproach to train neural networks for hardware based on spiking neurons and\nsynapses built on ferroelectric capacitor (FeCap) and Resistive switching\nnon-volatile devices (RRAM) respectively. In contrast to the more common\napproach of designing hardware to fit existing abstract neuron or synapse\nmodels, this approach starts with compact models of the physical device to\nmodel the computational primitive of the neurons. Based on these models, a\ntraining algorithm is developed that can reliably backpropagate through these\nphysical models, even when applying common hardware limitations, such as\nstochasticity, variability, and low bit precision. The training algorithm is\nthen tested on a spatio-temporal dataset with a network composed of quantized\nsynapses based on RRAM and ferroelectric leaky integrate-and-fire (FeLIF)\nneurons. The performance of the network is compared with different networks\ncomposed of LIF neurons.

Despite a\nlack of additional architectural features, inductive biases, or auxiliary\nobjectives, the agents nevertheless develop structured internal representations\nof their partners' task abilities, enabling rapid adaptation and generalisation\nto novel collaborators. We investigated these internal models through probing\ntechniques, and large-scale behavioural analysis. Notably, we find that\nstructured partner modelling emerges when agents can influence partner\nbehaviour by controlling task allocation. Our results show that partner\nmodelling can arise spontaneously in model-free agents -- but only under\nenvironmental conditions that impose the right kind of social pressure."}

Using the controlled\nAlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over\nsuccessive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth\npreferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while\nreinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation\nflexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early\noveroptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more\nstable and generalisable RLHF pipelines."}

However, RLHF often\nsuffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the\nreward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the\nidiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is\niterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated\nhuman feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,\nthe dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In\nthis work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in\niterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model\ntraining data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used\nfor optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled\nAlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over\nsuccessive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth\npreferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while\nreinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation\nflexibility.

To\nmitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named\nHAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)\nfactors regularization.

However, existing OSR methods use a\nconstant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss\nfunction, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in\nrepresentation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In\nthis paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated\nrepresentation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our\nscheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of\ntraining by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more\nneighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a\nricher and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods\nbenefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with\nmix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be\nfolded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed\nscheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and\ncontrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that\nour scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in\nmost cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks."}

Previous\nstudies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical\nfactors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has\nreceived little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how\nvariations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context\nquestion answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops\nsharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts\nconsistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity,\nposing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered,\nfine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three\ndiverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical\nreasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures.\nOur work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware\nLLM-driven systems."}
