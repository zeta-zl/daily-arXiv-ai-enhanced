These\nlimitations hamper their application to the open-ended landscape of real-world\nlanguage tasks.\n  This thesis proposes a series of methods to better adapt LMs to downstream\napplications. First, we explore strategies for extracting task-relevant\nknowledge from unlabelled data, introducing a novel continued pre-training\ntechnique that outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches. Next,\nwe present a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that substantially reduces\nmemory and compute costs while maintaining competitive performance. We also\nintroduce improved supervised fine-tuning methods that enable LMs to better\nfollow instructions, especially when labelled data is scarce, enhancing their\nperformance across a range of NLP tasks, including open-ended generation.\nFinally, we develop new evaluation methods and benchmarks, such as multi-hop\nspatial reasoning tasks, to assess LM capabilities and adaptation more\ncomprehensively.\n  Through extensive empirical studies across diverse NLP tasks, our results\ndemonstrate that these approaches substantially improve LM robustness,\nefficiency, and generalization, making them more adaptable to a broad range of\napplications.

There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation.

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback\n(RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization\n(DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate\neither individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with\na broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and\ndistribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct\nnovel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples\nto create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP\nare used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text\nversus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores\nthem to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and\nleverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For\nevaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20\ndifferent reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP\nscore, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare\ninstance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple\nFAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an\n81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets\nindeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards.

However, it cannot directly\nmeasure functional parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection\nfraction, which are crucial for assessing cardiac function. Cardiac magnetic\nresonance (CMR) is the gold standard for these measurements, providing detailed\nstructural and functional insights, but is expensive and less accessible. To\nbridge this gap, we propose PTACL (Patient and Temporal Alignment Contrastive\nLearning), a multimodal contrastive learning framework that enhances ECG\nrepresentations by integrating spatio-temporal information from CMR. PTACL uses\nglobal patient-level contrastive loss and local temporal-level contrastive\nloss. The global loss aligns patient-level representations by pulling ECG and\nCMR embeddings from the same patient closer together, while pushing apart\nembeddings from different patients. Local loss enforces fine-grained temporal\nalignment within each patient by contrasting encoded ECG segments with\ncorresponding encoded CMR frames. This approach enriches ECG representations\nwith diagnostic information beyond electrical activity and transfers more\ninsights between modalities than global alignment alone, all without\nintroducing new learnable weights. We evaluate PTACL on paired ECG-CMR data\nfrom 27,951 subjects in the UK Biobank. Compared to baseline approaches, PTACL\nachieves better performance in two clinically relevant tasks: (1) retrieving\npatients with similar cardiac phenotypes and (2) predicting CMR-derived cardiac\nfunction parameters, such as ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Our\nresults highlight the potential of PTACL to enhance non-invasive cardiac\ndiagnostics using ECG.

To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,\na benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The\nbenchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and\nreal-world agent scenarios evaluation.

Recently, there has also been growing interest in the reverse\ndirection-humans help chatbots-due to a wide range of benefits including better\nchatbot performance, human well-being, and collaborative outcomes. However,\nlittle research has explored the factors that motivate people to help chatbots.\nTo address this gap, we draw on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA)\nframework to examine how chatbot anthropomorphism-including human-like\nidentity, emotional expression, and non-verbal expression-influences human\nempathy toward chatbots and their subsequent prosocial behaviors and\nintentions. We also explore people's own interpretations of their prosocial\nbehaviors toward chatbots. We conducted an online experiment (N = 244) in which\nchatbots made mistakes in a collaborative image labeling task and explained the\nreasons to participants. We then measured participants' prosocial behaviors and\nintentions toward the chatbots. Our findings revealed that human identity and\nemotional expression of chatbots increased participants' prosocial behavior and\nintention toward chatbots, with empathy mediating these effects.

Since SAEs are trained post-hoc, it is unclear if the\nfailure to discover a particular concept is a failure on the SAE's side or due\nto the underlying LM not representing this concept. This problem is exacerbated\nby training conditions and architecture choices affecting which features an SAE\nlearns. When tracing how LMs learn concepts during training, the lack of\nfeature stability also makes it difficult to compare SAEs features across\ndifferent checkpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce a\nmodification to the transformer architecture that incorporates a TopK\nactivation function at chosen layers, making the model's hidden states\nequivalent to the latent features of a TopK SAE. This approach eliminates the\nneed for post-hoc training while providing interpretability comparable to SAEs.\nThe resulting TopK LMs offer a favorable trade-off between model size,\ncomputational efficiency, and interpretability. Despite this simple\narchitectural change, TopK LMs maintain their original capabilities while\nproviding robust interpretability benefits. Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe sparse representations learned by TopK LMs enable successful steering\nthrough targeted neuron interventions and facilitate detailed analysis of\nneuron formation processes across checkpoints and layers.

Existing LoRA-based\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches mitigate forgetting by assigning and\nfreezing task-specific adapters, but suffer from interference, redundancy, and\nambiguous routing due to coarse adapter-level selection. However, this design\nintroduces three key challenges: 1) Interference: Activating full LoRA experts\nper input leads to subspace interference and prevents selective reuse of useful\ncomponents across tasks. 2) Redundancy: Newly added experts often duplicate or\ncontradict existing knowledge due to unnecessary activation of unrelated ranks\nand insufficient reuse of relevant ones. 3) Ambiguity: Overlapping features\nacross tasks confuse the router, resulting in unstable expert assignments. As\nmore experts accumulate, earlier task routing degrades, accelerating\nforgetting. We propose MoRA, a Mixture-of-Rank Adaptive learning approach with\nself-activated and sparse rank activation for CL. Unlike mixing multiple\nlow-rank matrices, MoRA decomposes each rank-r update into r rank-1 components,\neach treated as an independent expert, enabling fine-grained mixture of rank-1\nexpert utilization while mitigating interference and redundancy. To avoid\nambiguous routing, we propose that each rank-1 expert can infer its own\nrelevance via intermediate activations. Coupled with our proposed rank pruning\nand activation budgets, MoRA adaptively selects a sparse mixture of ranks per\ninput. We validate MoRA on continual learning tasks with CLIP and large\nlanguage models (LLMs), analyzing both in-domain learning and out-of-domain\nforgetting/generalization during fine-tuning.

Recent research\nhas been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by\nselecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data\nfiltering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To\ncomplement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance\nby optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively\nunderexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering\ndata efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training\ndata organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data\nSelection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design\nLearnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which\nconsiders both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the\ngradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a\nnovel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model\nforgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the\ndata efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,\nvarious instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying\ndegrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these\ninstances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for\ndata ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy\ncan be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.\nTherefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM\ntraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "keywords": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

On one hand, regressive\nSR models aim to balance fidelity and perceptual quality to yield a single\nsolution, but this trade-off often introduces artifacts that create ambiguity\nin information-critical applications such as recognizing digits or letters. On\nthe other hand, diffusion models generate a diverse set of SR images, but\nselecting the most trustworthy solution from this set remains a challenge. This\npaper introduces a robust, automated framework for identifying the most\ntrustworthy SR sample from a diffusion-generated set by leveraging the semantic\nreasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, VLMs\nsuch as BLIP-2, GPT-4o, and their variants are prompted with structured queries\nto assess semantic correctness, visual quality, and artifact presence. The\ntop-ranked SR candidates are then ensembled to yield a single trustworthy\noutput in a cost-effective manner. To rigorously assess the validity of\nVLM-selected samples, we propose a novel Trustworthiness Score (TWS) a hybrid\nmetric that quantifies SR reliability based on three complementary components:\nsemantic similarity via CLIP embeddings, structural integrity using SSIM on\nedge maps, and artifact sensitivity through multi-level wavelet decomposition.\nWe empirically show that TWS correlates strongly with human preference in both\nambiguous and natural images, and that VLM-guided selections consistently yield\nhigh TWS values. Compared to conventional metrics like PSNR, LPIPS, which fail\nto reflect information fidelity, our approach offers a principled, scalable,\nand generalizable solution for navigating the uncertainty of the diffusion SR\nspace.

Data heterogeneity arises from three drift sources: real drift\n(a shift in the conditional distribution P(y|x)), virtual drift (a shift in the\ninput distribution P(x)), and label drift (a shift in the label distribution\nP(y)). However, most existing FL methods addressing concept drift primarily\nfocus on real drift. When clients experience virtual or label drift, these\nmethods often fail to selectively retain useful historical knowledge, leading\nto catastrophic forgetting. A key challenge lies in distinguishing different\nsources of drift, as they require distinct adaptation strategies: real drift\ncalls for discarding outdated data, while virtual or label drift benefits from\nretaining historical data. Without explicitly identifying the drift sources, a\ngeneral adaptation strategy is suboptimal and may harm generalization. To\naddress this challenge, we propose FedDAA, a dynamic clustered FL framework\ndesigned to adapt to multi-source concept drift while preserving valuable\nhistorical knowledge. Specifically, FedDAA integrates three modules: a cluster\nnumber determination module to find the optimal number of clusters; a real\ndrift detection module to distinguish real drift from virtual/label drift; and\na concept drift adaptation module to adapt to new data while retaining useful\nhistorical information. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees, and\nexperiments show that FedDAA achieves 7.84% to 8.52% accuracy improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "keywords": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although existing\nrobust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value\ndistribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To\naddress this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that\nenhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a\nswitching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism\ndynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially\ninduced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first\nderives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range\nof perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a\nmultiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in\nresponse to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving\nadversarial strategies.

In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods.

While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remain the mainstream\nbackbone for EEG decoding, their inherently short receptive field makes it\ndifficult to capture long-range temporal dependencies and global inter-channel\nrelationships. Recent CNN-Transformer (Conformers) hybrids partially address\nthis issue, but most adopt a serial design, resulting in suboptimal integration\nof local and global features, and often overlook explicit channel-wise\nmodeling. To address these limitations, we propose DBConformer, a dual-branch\nconvolutional Transformer network tailored for EEG decoding.

A lightweight channel attention\nmodule further refines spatial representations by assigning data-driven\nimportance to EEG channels. Extensive experiments on five motor imagery (MI)\ndatasets and two seizure detection datasets under three evaluation settings\ndemonstrate that DBConformer consistently outperforms 10 competitive baseline\nmodels, with over eight times fewer parameters than the high-capacity EEG\nConformer baseline. Further, the visualization results confirm that the\nfeatures extracted by DBConformer are physiologically interpretable and aligned\nwith sensorimotor priors in MI.

To detect such perturbations, we implement a conditional variational\nautoencoder (CVAE), leveraging negative log-likelihood to separate adversarial\ninputs from authentic OOD samples.

This makes the\nuncertainty quantification of these models of critical importance, especially\nin high-stakes domains, such as autonomy and healthcare. Prior work has made\nBayesian deep learning-based approaches to this problem more tractable by\nperforming inference over the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) parameters of a\nfine-tuned model. While effective, these approaches struggle to scale to larger\nLLMs due to requiring further additional parameters compared to LoRA. In this\nwork we present $\\textbf{Scala}$ble $\\textbf{B}$ayesian $\\textbf{L}$ow-Rank\nAdaptation via Stochastic Variational Subspace Inference (ScalaBL). We perform\nBayesian inference in an $r$-dimensional subspace, for LoRA rank $r$. By\nrepurposing the LoRA parameters as projection matrices, we are able to map\nsamples from this subspace into the full weight space of the LLM. This allows\nus to learn all the parameters of our approach using stochastic variational\ninference. Despite the low dimensionality of our subspace, we are able to\nachieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches while only\nrequiring ${\\sim}1000$ additional parameters.

However, existing methods struggle\nwith achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire\nlifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The\ncore challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what\nwe refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age\ntransformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this\nwork, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named\nCradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first\npass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection\n(AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of\nage and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by\nadjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing\nmore flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is\nweakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second\npass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features\nby conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace\nand Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the\nfirst pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the\naging accuracy.

Capturing node heterophily in heterogeneous graphs is very\nchallenging since both node/edge heterogeneity and node heterophily should be\ncarefully taken into consideration. Existing methods typically convert\nheterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones to learn node heterophily, which\nwill inevitably lose the potential heterophily conveyed by heterogeneous\nrelations.

Clinicians routinely\nencounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited\nexamples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or\nconsidering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question\nanswering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is\nlargely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL\nbenchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each\nincluding a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task\ndemonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer\ntriplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further\nintroduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A\ncomprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit\nmoderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended\nevaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on\nSMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++.

While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or\nhighly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of\ngrokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language\nmodel (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between samples\nduring grokking. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization conversion,\nproviding a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In the study, we\ndevelop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the complexity of a\nsingle pathway.

These properties make spCauchy a compelling\nalternative for VAEs, offering both theoretical advantages and practical\nefficiency in high-dimensional generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7403\u9762\u67ef\u897f\uff08spCauchy\uff09\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u6216von Mises-Fisher\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8d85\u7403\u9762\u8868\u793a\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5229\u7528\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u548cvMF\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faspCauchy\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528spCauchy\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7M\u00f6bius\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u5e42\u7ea7\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97KL\u6563\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "spCauchy\u5728VAE\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5982\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "spCauchy\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u9002\u5408VAE\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "keywords": "\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668, \u7403\u9762\u67ef\u897f\u5206\u5e03, \u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6570\u636e, M\u00f6bius\u53d8\u6362, KL\u6563\u5ea6"}}

Our system employs Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical\narchitectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,\nQASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline\nextracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent\nmodel input across all configurations.
