### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Key words: 大语言模型、文本嵌入、自监督、生成模型、检索增强生成

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督方法GEM，使大解码器语言模型（LLM）既能生成高质量文本嵌入，又能保持原有文本生成和推理能力。该方法通过插入特殊标记和调整注意力掩码实现，适用于任何LLM的后训练或微调阶段。实验证明其在文本嵌入基准（MTEB）上表现显著提升，同时对NLP基准（MMLU）影响极小。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前许多应用（如检索增强生成）需要独立的嵌入模型生成文本嵌入，导致系统复杂且嵌入模型与LLM对查询的理解可能不一致。为解决这一问题，提出GEM方法，让LLM自身具备生成高质量文本嵌入的能力。

Method: 在文本中插入新的特殊标记，并通过调整注意力掩码生成文本的摘要嵌入。方法简单，能轻松集成到现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在1B到8B参数的两种流行LLM家族上验证GEM方法，结果显示在MTEB上提升显著，同时对MMLU的影响极小。

Conclusion: GEM方法能够有效赋予LLM先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原有的NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Key words: 自动语音识别,低资源训练,口音鲁棒性,说话者数量,口音多样性

TL;DR: 研究发现，在低资源训练模式下，增加说话者数量比增加单个说话者的音频时长更能提升ASR对未见口音的鲁棒性。口音多样性在说话者数量固定时对性能影响不大。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 为了构建一个能够服务全球的自动语音识别（ASR）系统，ASR需要对包括未见口音在内的多种口音具有鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了训练数据中三个变量（说话者数量、每个说话者的音频时长、口音多样性）对ASR在低资源训练模式下对未见口音鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 固定训练时间下，增加说话者数量比增加单个说话者的音频时长更有效；更多说话者使得ASR性能随训练时间增加而提升；口音多样性在说话者数量固定时效果有限。

Conclusion: 构建ASR训练数据时，应优先增加说话者数量。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Key words: 句子嵌入、字典学习、可解释性、NLP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法，通过字典学习分解句子嵌入为可解释的组件，以增强其内部结构的透明度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 句子嵌入在现代NLP和AI系统中至关重要，但其内部结构尚不为人所知，且现有方法无法提供人类可解释的特征。

Method: 利用字典学习对词级表示进行分解，分析池化操作如何将特征压缩为句子表示，并评估句子嵌入中的潜在特征。

Result: 研究发现，句子嵌入空间中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法将词级可解释性与句子级分析结合，提供了更透明和可控的表示形式。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Key words: 层次文本分类,对比学习,路径引导,标签层次结构

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和路径引导层次结构的层次文本分类方法HTC-CLIP，显著提升了分类性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有HTC模型在编码标签层次结构和文本时存在互补性，但未有效结合。HTC-CLIP旨在整合两种方法的优点。

Method: 使用对比学习分别学习层次感知的文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，训练时学习两类概率分布，推理时合并输出。

Result: 在公共基准数据集上，Macro F1分数比现有最佳模型提高了0.99%-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP成功结合了两种互补的标签层次结构编码方法，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Key words: 大语言模型、低资源语言、马耳他语、微调、提示

TL;DR: 评估55个公开可用的LLM在马耳他语（低资源语言）上的表现，发现多数模型表现不佳，尤其是生成任务，而小型调优模型表现更好。研究还探讨了影响性能的因素，并推荐低资源语言研究采用更传统的语言建模方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 由于LLM在低资源语言上的表现有限，本研究旨在评估其具体表现，并提出改进建议。

Method: 使用新引入的基准测试（覆盖11个判别和生成任务）评估55个LLM的表现，并通过多维分析探究影响性能的因素。

Result: 小型调优模型表现更好，模型预训练和指令调优中对马耳他语的接触是重要因素。微调虽然成本高，但性能和推理成本更优。

Conclusion: 低资源语言技术需更具包容性，建议研究者采用更传统的语言建模方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Key words: 意图分类, 少量学习, 多领域泛化, 知识蒸馏, 电商客服

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合嵌入器和分类器的模型架构，利用少量标注数据实现跨领域意图分类，准确率比现有方法提升20-23%。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 由于跨领域数据稀缺，构建一个能在少量标注下泛化到多领域（如渠道、地理、语言）的意图分类器具有重要实践价值。

Method: 采用监督微调结合各向同性正则化训练领域特定嵌入器，并使用多语言知识蒸馏策略实现跨领域泛化，最后用简单线性分类器部署。

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥电商客服数据集上，少量样本意图检测准确率比SOTA预训练模型提升20-23%。

Conclusion: 该模型能显著提升跨领域意图分类性能，尤其在标注数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Key words: 语言模型, 罕见语法结构, 形式与语义, 样本效率

TL;DR: 研究探讨人规模预训练语言模型对罕见语法结构的理解和生成能力，发现其对形式敏感但对语义理解不足。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探索人规模语言模型是否能像人类一样掌握罕见语法结构及其含义。

Method: 通过构建定制化合成基准测试，评估模型对LET-ALONE结构的语法和语义知识。

Result: 模型对LET-ALONE的形式敏感，但在语义理解上无法正确泛化。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式与语义的样本效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习能力不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的实体结构提取方法依赖预定义模式或标注数据，导致结果不完整。ZOES 旨在解决这一问题，实现无需先验知识的实体结构发现。

Method: ZOES 采用富集、精炼和统一的机制，利用实体与其结构之间的相互强化关系，实现零样本开放模式的实体结构提取。

Result: 实验表明，ZOES 在三个不同领域中显著提升了实体结构提取的完整性，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ZOES 的机制为提升基于大型语言模型的实体结构发现质量提供了原则性方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文分析了两种主流水印方法对LLMs核心对齐属性的影响，并提出了一种名为对齐重采样的方法以恢复对齐性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究水印技术对大型语言模型输出的真实性、安全性和帮助性的影响，填补了这一领域的空白。

Method: 使用Gumbel和KGW两种水印方法测试四种对齐LLMs，提出对齐重采样（AR）方法以恢复对齐性能。

Result: 实验显示AR方法通过采样2-4个水印生成样本，能够恢复或超越未加水印的基线对齐分数。

Conclusion: 揭示了水印强度与模型对齐之间的平衡关系，为实际部署水印LLMs提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统偏好学习方法依赖人工或高级LLM生成的昂贵数据，难以扩展，通过利用UGC中的隐式偏好降低成本并提升可扩展性。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询并生成响应，利用UGC作为参考文本进行评分，从而对齐隐式偏好。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种高效、低成本的偏好学习解决方案，显著提升了模型的对齐能力和生成质量。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Key words: 文本到 SQL、大型语言模型、语义错误检测、查询修正

TL;DR: SQLens 是一个端到端的框架，用于细粒度检测和纠正由 LLM 生成的 SQL 查询中的语义错误，显著提高了错误检测和执行准确性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的文本到 SQL 系统（尤其是基于 LLM 的）生成的查询可能存在语义错误但语法正确的问题，且缺乏对可靠性的深入分析。需要一种方法来解决这些语义错误。

Method: SQLens 结合了底层数据库和 LLM 的错误信号，识别 SQL 子句中的潜在语义错误，并利用这些信号指导查询修正。

Result: 实验结果表明，SQLens 在错误检测的 F1 分数上优于最佳 LLM 自评估方法 25.78%，并将现成文本到 SQL 系统的执行准确率提高了 20%。

Conclusion: SQLens 在提高文本到 SQL 系统的可靠性和准确性方面表现出色，解决了 LLM 生成查询中的语义错误问题。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the

SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

TL;DR: SLIDE和DRE方法通过结合小型和大型语言模型的优势，显著提升了对话评估的准确性和可靠性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 针对大型语言模型（LLM）在模糊场景下表现不稳定，而小型语言模型（SLM）对误导性输入敏感的问题，提出结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 1. 引入SLIDE方法，通过自适应加权整合SLM和LLM；2. 提出DRE双细化评估方法，先由SLM引导LLM生成初步评估，再由SLM调整LLM的得分以提高准确性。

Result: 实验表明DRE方法优于现有方法，在多样化的基准测试中与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 结合小型和大型语言模型能够开发出更可靠的评估工具，尤其适用于开放式任务如对话评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在翻译任务中通过CoT显式分解任务的有效性，验证其是否确实带来性能提升。

Method: 对比实验：将人工设计的多步提示与简单的'重新翻译'提示进行效果比较。

Result: 未发现显式分解翻译过程带来明显性能提升；简单的'重新翻译'提示表现更优。

Conclusion: CoT在翻译任务中的有效性需进一步研究，未完全否定其作用，但需探索其他因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能区分多功能的英语话语粒子'just'的细微语义。

Method: 使用专家标注的数据，测试LLMs对'just'不同语义的区分能力。

Result: LLMs能区分大致类别，但对细微语义的捕捉能力不足。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解话语粒子的细微语义上存在不足。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 评估低资源非洲语言的机器翻译质量面临挑战，现有指标语言覆盖有限且性能不足。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言的SSA-MTE数据集，并开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE指标，同时测试了LLM如GPT-4和Claude的表现。

Result: SSA-COMET模型显著优于AfriCOMET，并与最强的LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro）竞争，尤其在Twi等低资源语言上表现突出。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和相关指标为低资源非洲语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released

Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中恶意代理的隐蔽攻击，揭示当前监测机制的安全漏洞。

Method: 提出四种攻击类型（Scapegoater、Boaster、Self-Dealer、Free-Rider），通过提示操纵实验验证其有效性。

Result: 恶意代理能够成功偏见系统行为并规避现有LLM监测器。

Conclusion: 需设计更安全的MAS架构和风险评估机制以应对隐蔽攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究不同LLMs及提示策略在金融情感分析中与人类标注的一致性，挑战推理总能提升模型性能的假设。

Method: 比较GPT-4o、GPT-4.1等模型在System 1/2提示范式下的表现，对比微调模型FinBERT-Prosus/Tone。

Result: 推理未提升性能，GPT-4o无CoT提示表现最佳；过度推理反而导致预测偏差。

Conclusion: 金融情感分类中，直觉型思考更贴近人类判断，推理可能适得其反。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: LLMs作为逻辑翻译器在真实场景中因词汇多样化问题表现不可靠，现有基准缺乏词汇多样性测试。

Method: 提出SCALe基准，通过逻辑不变词汇多样化生成新数据集；设计MenTaL方法，引导LLMs预建表达统一表再翻译。

Result: 实验证实LLMs在词汇多样化翻译中存在缺陷，MenTaL显著提升其性能。

Conclusion: SCALe和MenTaL填补了基准和方法上的空白，提升LLMs的逻辑翻译可靠性。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的多样本ICL演示选择方法仅限于随机选择，而实例级检索在多样本场景中不适用，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提升性能。

Method: 引入了一种梯度匹配方法，通过在目标任务的整个训练集和所选样本之间对齐微调梯度来选择演示样本。

Result: 在9个数据集上，从小样本到多样本场景中，该方法在多种大语言模型上表现优于随机选择，提升幅度高达4%。

Conclusion: 该研究为多样本ICL提供了一种更可靠和有效的演示选择方法，拓宽了其应用范围。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决基于检索增强语言模型的事实核查系统在处理对抗性声明时表现不足的问题。

Method: 采用三步模块化框架：声明分割与去情境化、迭代证据检索与声明编辑、证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个挑战性数据集上显著提高了检索和标签预测的准确性，优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA框架有效改进了对抗性声明的事实核查能力。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Conclusion: 模型在定位证据、跨模态信息聚合和图表基础组件理解上表现不佳，需改进。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a

pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech

by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging

Conclusion: $Safe$框架首次利用形式化语言验证LLM生成的推理，为其提供了理论基础和实用性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Conclusion: MISMATCHED填补领域空白，未来可优化模型。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: 现有的推理优化模型输出多样性不足，限制了TTS方法的有效性，希望通过提升多样性来最大化TTS效果。

Method: 提出ADAPT方法，结合轻量级的prefix tuning和多样性数据策略，以优化生成多样性。

Result: 实验表明，ADAPT在数学推理任务上仅需8分之一的计算量即可达到80%的准确率。

Conclusion: 生成多样性在最大化TTS效果中至关重要。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统研究强调社会结构对创新能力的塑造，本研究希望通过个人视角和人际创新机会的动态建模，揭示创新成功的机制。

Method: 基于动态语言表示，量化创新者的主观视角和机会，利用科学家、发明家、作家等数据，结合自然实验和AI模拟。

Result: 主观视角多样性能预测未来创意整合的成功，而背景多样性则相反；共同语言是成功协作的关键。

Conclusion: 视角多样性对创新至关重要，团队组建和研究政策应重视语言和视角的协同。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

### [30] [Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04624)
*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Key words: 静态词嵌入, 句子语义表示, 主成分分析, 知识蒸馏, 对比学习

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种优化的静态词嵌入方法，用于句子语义表示，通过主成分分析和知识蒸馏或对比学习改进词嵌入，并在句子语义任务中表现出色。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统的静态词嵌入在句子语义表示方面效果有限，因此需要一种改进方法来提升性能。

Method: 从预训练的句子Transformer中提取词嵌入，通过句子级主成分分析和知识蒸馏或对比学习进行优化，推断时通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中，提出的模型显著优于现有静态模型，甚至在某些数据集上与基本句子Transformer模型（SimCSE）媲美。

Conclusion: 该方法成功移除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据单词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数，显著提升了句子语义表示效果。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR 通过 Multi-Agent Meta-Verification 和 Exploration-based Reflection Learning 提升 LLMs 的工具使用能力，解决现有模型在工具规划和反思上的不足，并在性能和通用性上显著优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的 LLMs 在工具使用中存在工具规划不可靠和反思能力弱的问题，制约了其在复杂问题中的应用。

Method: 1. 引入 Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) 构建高质量工具指令数据集 ToolBench-V；2. 提出 Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE) 构建反思数据集 ToolBench-R。

Result: Tool-MVR 在 StableToolBench 上表现卓越，优于 ToolLLM 和 GPT-4，且在 RefineToolBench 上错误修正率显著提高。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR 通过验证和动态学习机制显著提升了 LLMs 的工具使用能力，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 克服音视频语音识别模型中数据稀缺的限制，特别是在英语以外的语言中。

Method: 提出从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的自动化方法，优化技术以提高效率和可访问性。

Result: 在越南语上开发的基线AVSR模型表现优异，在安静环境下与鲁棒ASR竞争，在嘈杂环境中表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（尤其是资源贫乏语言）提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Key words: KV缓存、量化、Transformer、内存优化、自适应精度

TL;DR: TaDA是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化技术，解决了传统量化方法中异常值处理的难题，显著减少了内存占用并保持了高精度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: Transformer模型中的KV缓存内存需求随序列长度增加而急剧上升，制约了大型语言模型的扩展部署。现有KV缓存量化方法仍需单独处理稀疏和非连续的异常值，效率较低。

Method: 提出TaDA方法，通过自适应量化精度（根据误差敏感度调整各层量化精度）和均值中心化技术（消除异常值单独处理的需求），实现了高效的KV缓存压缩。

Result: 实验表明，TaDA将KV缓存内存占用降低至原16位基准的27%，同时保持相当的模型精度。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的扩展部署提供了高效解决方案，支持更长上下文推理和复杂思维链任务。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Flex-TravelPlanner，一个评估语言模型在动态规划场景中灵活推理能力的基准测试。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现实世界中的规划问题需要不断适应变化的需求和平衡相互竞争的约束，而当前的基准测试主要关注静态、单轮场景。

Method: 在TravelPlanner数据集的基础上，引入了两种新颖的评价设置：多轮顺序约束引入和明确优先级的竞争约束场景。

Result: 实验发现，单轮任务表现无法预测多轮适应能力；约束引入顺序影响性能；模型在处理优先级约束时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强调了在更真实的动态规划场景中评估LLMs的重要性，并为改进模型在复杂规划任务中的性能提供了具体方向。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

*Raphaël Millière*

Key words: 大语言模型, 价值对齐, 对抗性攻击, AI安全, 规范性决策

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）的价值对齐问题，认为当前的对齐策略在防止滥用方面存在根本性不足。尽管通过基于人类偏好的微调尝试灌输诸如帮助性、诚实和无害等规范，但LLMs仍易受对抗性攻击的侵害。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着AI系统（如LLMs）的发展，其安全部署问题日益突出。作者旨在揭示现有对齐方法的局限性，并指出其无法赋予LLMs真正的规范性决策能力。

Method: 通过分析人类道德心理学的研究，作者比较了人类的深思熟虑推理能力与LLMs在规范性冲突中的脆弱性。

Result: 研究表明，当前的对齐方法（“浅层对齐”）仅强化了行为倾向，未能解决LLMs在规范性冲突中的根本缺陷。

Conclusion: 现有的对齐方法不足以应对日益强大的AI系统可能带来的潜在危害，需探索更深入的对齐策略。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: REWIRE提出了一种通过改写低质量文本来提升预训练数据质量的方法，实验证明其效果优于传统数据过滤和合成方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决预训练数据因高质量文本有限而面临的扩展难题。

Method: 通过REWIRE方法改写被过滤的低质量文本，使其可用于训练。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合改写文本使任务性能提升1.0-2.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 改写低质量文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 互联网上的仇恨言论威胁社会和谐，现有方法对隐式仇恨言论检测效果不佳。

Method: 提出六种编码策略（codetypes），并通过直接提示LLMs分类或嵌入编码过程两种方法检测隐式仇恨言论。

Result: 实验证明，codetypes能提升中英文数据集的隐式仇恨言论检测效果。

Conclusion: codetypes方法有效提升了隐式仇恨言论的跨语言检测能力。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前的语言模型推理方法（如best-of-N采样和树搜索）需要大量计算资源，STAND旨在解决性能与效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: STAND通过随机推测和概率信息保存（基于logit的N-gram模块）、优化的Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动的树构建，提高词汇接受率。

Result: STAND在多种模型和推理任务中，将推理延迟降低60-65%，吞吐量优于现有推测解码方法14-28%，单路径场景下延迟降低48-58%。

Conclusion: STAND是一种无需额外训练的即插即用方案，可显著加速语言模型推理。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决单一LLM在生成多样性和评估偏见上的不足。

Method: 多个LLM组成"斯巴达部落"，通过竞争和互相评估生成偏好对，并基于Elo排名系统更新模型权重。

Result: 在12个任务和数据集中的10个上优于初始模型和4个基线方法，平均提升7.0%。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT能有效提升模型性能，并更好地泛化到新任务。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Result: 评测超过20个主流MLLMs，发现现有模型在HSS任务上仍面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: HSSBench将推动MLLMs跨学科推理能力的研究，尤其是知识内化与跨领域连接能力的提升。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架有效提升了假新闻检测的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

### [44] [Identifying Reliable Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Text Revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04772)
*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Key words: 文本修订, 科学写作, 评估指标, LLM, 混合方法

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了科学写作中文本修订的评估方法，分析了传统指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）的局限性，并探索了更符合人类判断的替代评估方法，最终提出了一种结合LLM评估和领域特定指标的混合方法。

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 传统文本评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）主要关注相似性而非修订的实质性改进，因此在科学写作的修订评估中存在不足。本文旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: 通过人工标注研究评估修订质量，探索无参考评估指标，并分析LLM作为评委的能力，最终提出混合评估方法。

Result: LLM在评估指令遵循方面表现良好，但在正确性上存在不足；领域特定指标能提供补充信息；混合方法效果最佳。

Conclusion: 结合LLM评估和领域特定指标的混合方法是评估修订质量的最可靠方法。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

*Jingyu Hu,Mengyue Yang,Mengnan Du,Weiru Liu*

Key words: LLMs, 政治倾向, 多维度分析, 表征工程, 干预实验

TL;DR: 该研究通过多维度政治学习框架和可解释的表征工程技术，揭示并干预大语言模型（LLM）的内部政治倾向。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究发现LLMs的开放回答与其内部意图不一致，且现有政治分析多依赖单轴概念，可能导致混淆，因此扩展为多维度分析。

Method: 设计了四维政治学习框架，构建数据集用于细粒度政治概念向量学习，并应用三种表征工程技术在八个开源LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，这些向量能解离政治概念混淆，检测任务验证了向量的语义意义，并在OOD设置中表现出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性；干预实验显示向量能改变LLMs的政治倾向回答。

Conclusion: 多维政治向量有助于透明化LLM的政治概念学习，并实现对政治倾向的检测与干预。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究语音中丰富的声学信息（如语义、副语言特征和语音学特征）的整合能力，现有模型的性能仍有待提升。

Method: 开发了一个包含5,000个音频-问题-答案三元组的基准，涵盖47个任务并系统整合多种语言学现象。

Result: 评估了14个先进语音LLM，发现现有模型在细粒度感知和推理方面有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: MMSU为语音理解提供了新标准，为未来更复杂的人机语音交互系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Result: 研究发现了一些新兴模式，并为研究者提供了结构化的集成技术概述。

Conclusion: 本文的分类框架和见解有助于指导未来基于预训练基础的更强大多模态集成模型的开发。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有基准仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法捕捉推理过程的质量和结构，FineLogic旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，并在四种监督格式下（一种自然语言和三种符号变体）训练LLM，研究推理能力的表现。

Result: 自然语言监督具有强泛化能力，符号监督则促进结构更合理的推理链；微调主要通过逐步生成增强推理能力。

Conclusion: FineLogic为评估和改进LLM的逻辑推理提供了更严格和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 机器翻译常含错误，需人工校对，为提高效率和质量，提出新方法。

Method: 结合CNN捕获局部n-gram模式，BERT生成上下文表示，整合错误检测与修正模块。

Result: 实验显示90%准确率和89.37% F1值，超过现有技术10%。

Conclusion: 该方法在识错和修正方面表现优异，显著提升校对效果。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在真实课堂环境（尤其是教育资源不足地区）的教育评估效果。

Method: 评估VLM和多个LLM对646份印尼四年级学生手写答卷的处理能力，涵盖数学和英语的多种题型。

Result: VLM手写识别不准确导致LLM评分错误，但生成的反馈仍有一定价值。

Conclusion: VLM和LLM在教育评估中有潜力，但需改进手写识别和反馈个性化问题。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 加密填字游戏线索是具有挑战性的语言任务，现有的测试集每天由全球主要报纸发布。需要一种能够独立验证答案正确性的系统。

Method: 构建了一个由开源组件组成的LLM推理系统，包括三个步骤：假设答案、提出字词解释、以及使用验证器系统验证推理步骤。

Result: 该系统在Cryptonite数据集（来自英国《泰晤士报》和《每日电讯报》）上实现了新的最先进性能，并提供可解释的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 通过将解决方案表达为Python代码，该系统不仅高效解决了加密填字游戏，还为验证答案提供了透明且可检查的推理过程。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

Key words: 大型推理模型、幻觉检测、RACE、推理一致性、答案不确定性

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要关注答案级别的不确定性，而忽略了推理过程中的冗余或逻辑不一致，这些问题在LRM中尤为关键。

Method: 提出了RACE框架，通过提取关键推理步骤并计算四个诊断信号（推理一致性、答案不确定性、语义对齐和内部一致性），实现细粒度检测。

Result: 实验表明，RACE在多个数据集和LLM上优于现有基线，提供了通用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Conclusion: RACE为LRM的幻觉检测提供了新方法，强调了推理过程一致性的重要性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Result: 发布了包含5种欧洲语言的7小时录音数据集，以及适合长输入对齐的注释工具和评估指标。

Conclusion: MockConf数据集和InterAlign工具为同声传译研究提供了宝贵的资源和工具。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Conclusion: LLMs 在多选题生成方面具有潜力，能为教育体验带来改进，未来需进一步研究提升 AI 在教育中的接受度。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Method: 使用8种不同规模的开源LLMs，通过调整提示策略、少样本数量和演示选择，分析其对翻译结果的影响。

Result: 发现指令措辞与演示对齐对长度控制至关重要；极端示例更易缩短翻译；少样本提示普遍提升质量，但5、10、20样本设置间改进有限；多输出选择显著优化了长度与质量的权衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在等距翻译中表现依赖于演示与指令的匹配，多输出选择可优化性能，部分语言对达到SOTA。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Method: 将UD整合到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中评估其效果。

Result: UD显著提升了模型的准确率和F1分数，平均提升分别为3.85%和6.08%，并在某些语言对中超越大型语言模型。

Conclusion: UD在跨领域任务中具有潜力和有效性，其相似性分数与模型表现正相关。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and

insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models

a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

*Alex Pan,Mary-Anne Williams*

Key words: 大语言模型, 嵌套叙事推理, ListOps, 基准测试, 状态管理

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps 是一个新的基准测试，通过将 ListOps 计算转化为长故事来测试大语言模型（LLM）在嵌套叙事推理中的表现，揭示其在状态管理和中间结果处理方面的局限性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有的长上下文和多跳问答基准测试未能充分测试嵌套叙事推理，无法解耦上下文长度与推理复杂度，掩盖了 LLM 的根本限制。需要通过新的基准测试来揭示这一问题。

Method: 通过编程将 ListOps 计算转化为长而连贯的故事，强制模型进行内部计算和状态管理，同时提供对叙事规模和推理难度的精细控制。

Result: 实验表明，即使领先的 LLM（如 OpenAI o4 和 Gemini 2.5 Pro）在简单 ListOps 计算中表现优异，但在 Verbose ListOps 的中等长度叙事（约 10k token）中性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 解决这一问题是实现真实世界文本解释的关键，Verbose ListOps 及其可扩展框架为目标推理改进提供了工具，而不仅仅是扩展上下文窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究动机在于验证多语言端到端模型微调在小样本低资源语言ASR系统中的性能是否最优，并提出更有效的替代方案。

Method: 作者提出了一种结合混合HMM和自监督模型的方法，通过持续的自监督预训练和半监督训练，更有效地利用有限的数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语上，该方法相比微调的Whisper模型，词错误率（WER）相对降低了32%。

Conclusion: 结合混合HMM和自监督模型的方法在小样本低资源语言ASR系统中表现优于传统微调方法。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在不同语言中为数学推理任务提供教学支持的能力。

Method: 通过大规模模拟多语言师生交互，使用强模型作为导师生成提示，弱模型模拟学生。

Result: 多语言提示显著提升学习效果，尤其在低资源语言中。

Conclusion: 多语言LLM教育工具既有效又包容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Result: 实验表明，融入上下文信息能显著提升翻译质量。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对NMT的提升具有重要意义，新数据集为相关研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Method: 提出增量半监督学习流程，结合少量目标领域标记数据和相关领域辅助数据集，通过多模型共识或命名实体识别筛选和迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 在多领域的Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上表现优于单步微调，多模型共识筛选方法在Wow和Fisher上分别带来22.3%和24.8%的相对提升。

Conclusion: 多模型共识筛选是最优方法，次优方法是命名实体识别，后者计算成本更低。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型（LLMs）的理解过程是否与专家一致，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出SCOP框架，定义五种必备理解技能，构建测试数据，分析开源和闭源LLMs。

Result: LLMs在专家级理解过程中表现不足，但局部理解能力与专家相似；存在通过错误过程得到正确答案的现象。

Conclusion: LLMs需改进理解过程训练，确保所有理解技能充分发展。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前控制生成文本长度的方法通常需要复杂模型改动，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性，需要一种更简单的方法。

Method: 通过增加EOS标记在交叉熵损失计算中的重要性，控制生成文本的长度，兼容不同架构和解码算法。

Result: 该方法在多种模型（如encoder-decoder和GPT风格LLMs）上有效控制生成长度，且不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: 提出了一种简单、兼容性强的方法来控制文本生成长度，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Conclusion: AR-Checker能有效测试LLM的鲁棒性，适用范围广。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

Result: 研究发现，虽然大模型在某些方面能接近人类评委的评分水平，但在整体评分行为上仍存在显著差异；同时，前沿LLM在生成有说服力的辩论演讲方面可能达到人类水平。

Conclusion: 论文为LLM在复杂认知任务中的评估提供了新的视角和基准。

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Motivation: 研究LLMs的自我报告是否可以被视为内省，探讨语言模型是否具备类似人类的自我认知能力。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的两个自我报告实例，评估其是否具备内省能力。

Result: 第一个示例中LLM的创造性写作描述不构成内省；第二个示例中LLM正确推断自身温度参数可视为内省，但并非伴随意识体验。

Conclusion: LLMs可表现出某种形式的内省能力，但这种能力与人类的内省存在本质区别。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Motivation: 尽管LLMs在翻译任务中表现强大，但RLHF在俚语字幕翻译任务中意外表现不佳，原因是离线奖励模型与在线LLM由于分布偏移而逐渐偏离，导致训练结果不理想。

Method: 提出RIVAL对抗训练框架，将训练过程建模为奖励模型和LLM之间的极小极大博弈，结合定性（偏好奖励）和定量（如BLEU）奖励，提升训练稳定性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，RIVAL显著优于基线翻译模型。

Conclusion: 对抗训练框架RIVAL通过优化奖励模型与LLM的交互机制，有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了俚语字幕翻译的质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的自残意图检测对早期干预和心理支持至关重要，但由于表达方式的隐晦和上下文依赖性，现有的大型语言模型难以准确识别。

Method: 研究构建了CESM-100表情符号敏感矩阵和SHINES数据集，并通过多任务学习微调LLMs以区分自残意图（主要任务）和检测普通提及与严重意图（辅助任务），同时生成可解释的预测理由。

Conclusion: 通过结合意图区分和上下文线索，研究有效解决了自残信号中的模糊性问题，为社交媒体的心理健康干预提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language

emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial

detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious

CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究旨在探索社区街道的商业活力与街道特征（如车辆密度、绿化、清洁度和街道宽度）之间的关系，为城市设计和规划提供科学依据。

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过基于GPT-4的感知建模提取空间属性进行分析。

Result: 研究发现适度的车辆存在有助于商业活动，但过度停车和狭窄街道会降低满意度和定价；绿化与清洁度显著提升满意度，但对定价影响较弱。街道宽度对车辆影响有调节作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，结合AI辅助感知与城市形态分析可以捕捉商业成功的非线性驱动因素，为城市设计和停车管理提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

Key words: 误导文本, 对比学习, 隐式立场推理, 社交媒体, 检测框架

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合对比学习和隐式立场推理的新框架CL-ISR，用于提高社交媒体误导文本的检测准确率。

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 社交媒体上的误导文本可能导致公众误解、社会恐慌甚至经济损失，因此检测这些文本至关重要。

Method: 使用对比学习算法增强模型对真实与误导文本语义差异的学习能力；引入隐式立场推理模块挖掘文本中的潜在立场倾向及其与相关主题的关系；将两者结合形成CL-ISR框架。

Result: 该框架显著提高了误导文本的检测效果，尤其在语言复杂或隐含立场的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: CL-ISR通过对比学习和立场推理的结合，有效提升了社交媒体误导文本的检测能力。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

Motivation: 解决BERT和W2V在口语评估中各自的模态局限性（BERT缺乏音韵信息，W2V缺乏语义解释性），提升评估效果。

Method: 通过分数融合策略，整合W2V和Phi-4多模态大型语言模型。

Result: 在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025的测试集上，RMSE达到0.375，排名第二。

Conclusion: 融合多模态模型的方法有效提升了口语评估的准确性和全面性。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在零样本事件检测中理解复杂事件本体、提取域特定触发器时的局限性和效率不足问题。

Method: 提出 DiCoRe 框架，包含发散推理的 Dreamer 部分和收敛推理的 Grounder 部分；Dreamer 通过开放事件发现提升覆盖率，Grounder通过有限状态机约束解码对齐任务指示；最后通过 LLM-Judge 验证输出。

Result: 在五个领域的六个数据集和九个大型语言模型上，DiCoRe 显著优于基线方法，平均 F1 分数提升 4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe 是一种高效且强大的零样本事件检测框架，适用于跨领域任务。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Method: 提出了m-局部熵作为一种信息论度量，通过平均损失上下文惊异值量化语言的局部不确定性，并在自然语言语料库和PFSA定义的语言上进行实验。

Result: 实验证明，m-局部熵高的语言对Transformer和LSTM语言模型更难学习。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型与人类类似，对语言的局部统计结构高度敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 理解大型音频语言模型的内部机制对于解释其行为和提升性能至关重要。

Result: 发现LALMs主要依赖查询听觉输入而非聚合隐藏状态信息，并提出了一种增强模型的方法。

Conclusion: 研究结果为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，为未来改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探究LLM是否能准确复现人类对语义错误严重性的判断，尤其是在多模态情境下的表现。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg等人的实验框架，在单模态（纯文本）和多模态（文本+图像）设置下评估四种错误类型（年龄、性别、服装类型和颜色）。

Result: 人类对不同错误类型赋予不同严重性，而大多数LLM在性别和颜色错误的评估上与人类不一致。DeepSeek-V3在单模态和多模态条件下均表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLM在评估错误严重性时可能受社会规范影响，但缺乏人类对颜色的感知基础，仅少数模型表现接近人类。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1显著提升了鲁棒性和推理准确性，在对抗情景中优于基线17.07%，并在一般RAG任务中表现一致优异。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1通过自主结合参数和上下文知识，有效解决了当前RAG系统的依赖问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Method: 通过机制可解释性方法，识别GPT-2和Llama2中导致偏见行为的关键内部边，并评估其稳定性、局部化和泛化性。

Result: 偏见相关计算集中在少数层中，且在不同微调设置下会发生变化，移除这些组件会减少偏见输出但影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了偏见的结构表征及其对模型的广泛影响，为模型去偏提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Result: 实验表明ECoRAG在开放域问答任务中优于现有压缩方法，且具有更高的成本效益。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过证据性压缩显著提升了LLM的性能和效率，同时优化了资源使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

Result: 当前最先进的LLMs在复杂语法和样本上表现接近随机猜测，且准确性可通过语法复杂度预测。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂任务中倾向于依赖浅层启发式而非遵循复杂指令。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

### [87] [Improving Low-Resource Morphological Inflection via Self-Supervised Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05227)
*Adam Wiemerslage,Katharina von der Wense*

Key words: 自监督学习,极低资源,形态屈折,字符级任务,CMLM

TL;DR: 本文研究了自监督辅助任务在极低资源环境中对形态屈折（一种与语言文档高度相关的字符级任务）的有效性，并通过实验比较了多种任务的表现。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 由于许多世界语言缺乏大规模未标注数据，自监督目标在这些语言中的应用有限。此外，字符级任务中自监督目标的研究较少，尽管少量数据可能带来益处。

Method: 研究了19种语言和13种辅助任务的自监督目标的有效性，训练了编码器-解码器变换器模型。具体任务包括自动编码和字符掩码语言建模（CMLM）等。

Result: 在数据极其有限时，自动编码表现最佳；随着数据增加，CMLM更有效。基于已知语素边界的掩码采样能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 自监督任务在低资源形态建模中具有潜力，尤其是结合语素边界的CMLM。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 为了解决不同语言学框架对非连续结构分析独立且不收敛的问题。

Method: 采用短语结构语法（PSG）、依存语法（DG）和范畴语法（CG）的表示方法，构建统一数学推导系统。

Result: 展示了连续和非连续表达均可通过统一系统进行分析。

Conclusion: 统一系统能有效整合三种语法形式，为语言结构分析提供新视角。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Motivation: 现有的自然语言推理方法在处理幻觉检测时缺乏细粒度的推理，作者希望通过结构化推理提升性能。

Method: 定义了一个三步推理过程：(i)声明分解，(ii)子声明归因和蕴涵分类，(iii)聚合分类，并引入分析指标验证中间步骤质量。

Result: 实验表明，这种引导式推理方法显著提升了幻觉检测的效果。

Conclusion: 系统化和细粒度的推理过程能有效改进幻觉检测任务的性能。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

Motivation: 解决检索增强生成（RAG）系统中知识冲突问题，现有方法因直接比较知识源导致模型负担过重，影响性能。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，采用分层动作空间和细粒度比较，以自动适应复杂上下文。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上显著提高问答准确性，尤其在时间和语义冲突类型上表现突出。

Conclusion: Micro-Act不仅有效缓解知识冲突，还在无冲突问题上表现稳健，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，ProRefine比零样本基线性能提升3%到37%。

Conclusion: ProRefine提升准确性的同时，使小模型能媲美大模型，推动了高效、可扩展的AI部署。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有去学习方法通过正则化权衡遗忘和保留目标，常导致优化不稳定和性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用约束优化问题，遗忘通过“对数间隔扁平化损失”强制执行，保留通过硬约束保护，使用可扩展的对偶算法求解。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，有效移除目标信息且保持下游性能。

Conclusion: 新框架为LLM去学习提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量和来源影响；搜索在非搜索场景可能提升性能，但在搜索场景中仅依赖模型知识会显著降低质量。

Conclusion: Search Arena数据集为搜索增强语言模型研究提供了新资源，揭示了用户偏好与引用行为的关系。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Result: 研究发现偏好模型在60%以上的情况下偏向放大的偏见特征，且与人类偏好的校准偏差约为40%。使用CDA方法后，校准偏差从39.4%降至32.5%，绝对偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对性的去偏方法是构建可靠偏好模型的有效手段，且反事实数据增强显著减少了模型的校准偏差。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该研究验证了Transformer架构在材料科学中的可行性，展示了数据驱动方法革新结构行为预测和工程设计的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while
maintaining topic relevance.

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling
quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup
in verification time compared to traditional methods. MUC-G4 hence offers a
promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural
networks in practical applications.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

Result: 实验表明DrSR在多个科学领域的准确性和泛化能力上显著优于传统和最新的基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: DrSR在科学方程发现中展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Conclusion: PANN为资源受限的星载数据处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

Conclusion: BAT和ALBAT为适应训练提供了有效的解决方案，尤其适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Conclusion: 预训练任务的结构性有助于模型发展关系推理的表征，从而支持上下文中的推理能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: LDPTRLQ算法在理论分析和实际应用中均表现出色，为物联网优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

Abstract: Ensuring grid stability in the transition to renewable energy sources
requires accurate power demand forecasting. This study addresses the need for
precise forecasting by differentiating among industrial, commercial, and
residential consumers through customer clusterisation, tailoring the
forecasting models to capture the unique consumption patterns of each group. A
feature selection process is done for each consumer type including temporal,
socio-economic, and weather-related data obtained from the Copernicus Earth
Observation (EO) program. A variety of AI and machine learning algorithms for
Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF)
are explored and compared, determining the most effective approaches. With all
that, the main contribution of this work are the new forecasting approaches
proposed, which have demonstrated superior performance compared to simpler
models, both for STLF and VSTLF, highlighting the importance of customized
forecasting strategies for different consumer groups and demonstrating the
impact of incorporating detailed weather data on forecasting accuracy. These
advancements contribute to more reliable power demand predictions, thereby
supporting grid stability.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

Result: 软对数-softmax级联增强了集成学习的多样性和一致性，信息度量提供了可靠的评估工具。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂问题中表现优越，可通过多样性提升系统性能。

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features
for RFT-based red teaming. Code for the benchmark can be accessed at

Conclusion: YOTO方法通过单次训练实现了损失权重的自动优化，显著提高了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

Motivation: 研究一种新的隐藏单元结构以减少神经网络的参数数量，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 半单元分为两个阶段：固定随机权重的加权和输入，然后通过可调整的乘数和偏移进行变换。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上验证了半单元的有效性，实现了合理精度和较少的参数数量。

Conclusion: 半单元层为减少神经网络参数提供了新方法，同时表现出良好的正则化效果。

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

terms: annualized return downside risk differential return and the Treynor
ratio
  Unlike single metric objectives for example the Sharpe ratio our formulation
is modular and parameterized by weights w1 w2 w3 and w4 enabling practitioners
to encode diverse investor preferences
  We tune these weights via grid search to target specific risk return profiles

boundedness and modularity
  This framework offers a general blueprint for building robust multi objective
reward functions in complex trading environments and can be extended with
additional risk measures or adaptive weighting

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Conclusion: 样本回放的效果受样本选择和任务关系影响，甚至在简单设置中也可能有害。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 为了提高无目标网络方法在强化学习中的性能，同时避免因移除目标网络而导致的稳定性问题。

Method: 提出iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL)，共享在线网络的大部分参数并复制最后一层作为目标网络，结合并行学习Bellman迭代。

Result: iS-QL显著减少了目标网络与无目标网络方法间的性能差距，提高了样本效率，且内存占用和训练时间与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: iS-QL是一种高效的替代方案，能够在减少内存占用的同时提升强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

Result: 在2D点代理和连续控制元强化学习基准测试中，UMCNP能以更少的样本适应未见任务。

Conclusion: UMCNP在元测试中显著减少了样本需求，同时保持高效性能。

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

Motivation: 自监督对比学习在实际应用中表现出色，但其理论基础尚不完善。本文旨在填补这一空白，揭示CL与NSCL损失的理论关系。

Method: 通过分析CL目标与NSCL损失的隐式近似性，并证明两者差距随类别数量增加的消失性。研究了NSCL损失的全局极小值的几何结构，以及提出了一种新的few-shot误差边界。

Result: 研究发现CL与NSCL损失在类别数量增加时趋于一致；NSCL损失的学习表征表现出augmentation collapse和within-class collapse，且类中心形成等角紧框架。新的few-shot误差边界在实际中提供了紧密的性能估计。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习的目标隐式逼近NSCL损失，两者在类别数量增加时趋于一致。这些理论发现通过实验验证，为CL的广泛应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

Result: 实验表明，提出的算法在收敛性能上优于或等同于传统一阶方法，并显著降低内存需求。

Conclusion: 零阶优化方法为资源受限的大语言模型微调提供了实用且理论支持的新途径。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

Result: 在图像分类和语言建模等多种任务中，KOALA++的准确性达到或超过最先进的一阶和二阶优化器，同时保持了一阶方法的计算效率。

Conclusion: KOALA++成功捕捉了更丰富的不确定性结构，同时避免了高阶计算的开销，为神经网络训练提供了一种高效的优化方案。

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

Motivation: 探究神经网络训练中的grokking现象，尤其是anti-grokking阶段的性质及其与现有理论的区别。

Method: 使用3层MLP在MNIST子集上训练，引入HTSR指标α和其他对比指标进行分析。

Result: 发现anti-grokking阶段，其特征是α<2且存在Correlation Traps，其他指标无法区分grokking和anti-grokking。

Conclusion: HTSR指标α能有效衡量过拟合和泛化崩溃，提出α≈2作为通用层收敛目标。

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

Conclusion: 选择性损失函数能够有效区分高重要性区域，提升模型性能，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Result: 揭示了现有基准测试在行为系统性评估上的局限性，并展示了如何通过机制可解释性方法评估表征的系统性。

Conclusion: 强调表征系统性评估的重要性，并为未来研究提供了新的方向和工具，以更全面地实现模型的系统性泛化能力。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究旨在利用机器学习模型对牙科服务提供者进行分类，以便更好地分配资源给服务不足的人群。

Method: 使用2018年包含24,300个实例和20个特征的数据集，通过信息增益、基尼指数和ANOVA进行特征排名，评估12种ML模型（如kNN、SVM、随机森林等），采用10折交叉验证。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) models for
classifying dental providers into two categories - standard rendering providers
and safety net clinic (SNC) providers - using a 2018 dataset of 24,300
instances with 20 features. The dataset, characterized by high missing values
(38.1%), includes service counts (preventive, treatment, exams), delivery
systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

Result: 在CIFAR-10及含噪声数据上，$
eg$Grad模型在保持准确率的同时显著提升校准性指标。

Conclusion: $
eg$Grad是一种高效且通用的校准方法，理论分析支持其收敛性及优势。

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

Motivation: 在大语言模型（LLM）的适配策略选择中，如何在不进行昂贵实验的情况下准确预测性能和成本是一个重要问题。

Method: 论文引入了COSMOS框架，通过嵌入增强的轻量级代理模型预测微调性能，以及低样本缩放法则预测检索增强的上下文学习效果。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，COSMOS平均降低了92.72%的计算成本，最高可达98.71%，同时保持高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高效预测适配结果是可行的，并能显著减少LLM部署的计算开销，同时保持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

Result: 成功构建了多种动态生物分子系统（如转运蛋白和抗体）的原子模型。

Conclusion: CryoBoltz为冷冻电镜数据的原子模型构建提供了灵活而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

Result: PGT在模拟和实验硬件上均表现出与传统反向传播相当的性能。

Conclusion: PGT为将物理储备整合到更深层神经网络架构中提供了可能，有望提升AI训练的能效。

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂动力系统的长期预测提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding
minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练中，跨地理分布的加速器导致高昂通信成本和硬件利用不均，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 采用分层异步优化框架（HALoS），引入局部和全局参数服务器，减少跨区域通信，利用快速区域内链接。

Result: HALoS在非凸目标下具有收敛性，比同步基线快7.5倍，比异步方法快2.1倍，同时保持模型质量。

Conclusion: 分层服务器端更新和全局模型合并是异构分布式环境中高效训练大型语言模型的有力工具。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Conclusion: Neural MJD 通过显式建模随机过程和非齐次动态，显著提升了非平稳时间序列预测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised
learning workflows for making reliable and reproducible scientific discoveries.
In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 通过聚类和中位数聚合策略，该方法有效提升了差分隐私语言模型推理的生成质量和隐私保障。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Motivation: 通过缩放定律比较不同模型和数据集的预训练效果，避免单一尺度下的误导性结论，为开放基础模型和数据集提供系统比较和改进方法。

Method: 基于密集测量在两个语言视觉学习模型（CLIP和MaMMUT）上推导完整的缩放定律，并使用恒定学习率计划节省计算成本。

Conclusion: 准确推导缩放定律为跨尺度模型和数据集比较提供了有效工具，推动了开放基础模型的系统优化。

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for
reproducing experiments in the paper and raw experiments data can be found at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where

the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

Result: 双向边界显著稳定了EBM训练，并提升了密度估计和样本生成的质量。

Conclusion: 双向边界是一种有效且稳健的EBM训练方法，未来可进一步探索边界设计与优化。

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: 本文方法能够在实际应用中高效优化智能体组合，兼顾任务成功率和多维度风险需求。

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

Result: 证明经典解决方案（如跳跃连接和归一化）可以成功堆叠深度GNN层而不降低性能。

Conclusion: 重新审视了过度平滑的作用，揭示了深度GNN的潜力。

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Result: FedAPM在收敛速度、准确性和通信效率上优于现有方法，平均提升12.3%测试准确率、16.4% F1分数和18.0% AUC。

Conclusion: FedAPM有效解决客户端漂移，显著提升联邦学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: DIPNet能无缝集成到现有模型中，为现代深度学习的泛化性能提升提供通用有效方法。

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了机器学习模型在干旱预测中的有效性，同时揭示了区域干旱脆弱性的差异，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Conclusion: dual-ISL是一种高效且稳定的隐式生成模型训练方法，具有理论优势和实践表现。

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Motivation: 随着生成模型的普及，如何在无需完全重新训练的情况下选择性遗忘特定数据（如隐私或有害内容）变得至关重要。

Method: 通过损失梯度正交化实现快速遗忘算法，确保遗忘数据的同时保持模型生成质量和其他数据的训练效果。

Result: 在MNIST和CelebA数据集上，相比梯度手术等方法，该算法实现了数量级更快的遗忘速度，同时保持生成模型的原始性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决生成模型中的数据遗忘问题提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster
unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: GRPO算法虽成功提升LLM推理能力，但其缺乏中间监督易造成探索效率低和训练不稳定。

Method: 提出MGRPO，首层生成初始响应，第二层专门校正错误，形成自校正循环。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，MGRPO显著优于标准GRPO，表现更优。

Conclusion: MGRPO通过自校正机制有效提升推理能力和训练稳定性。

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Motivation: 传统注意力机制（如Transformers）存在二次计算和线性内存复杂度的瓶颈，而线性注意力和状态空间模型虽高效，但受限于固定大小的隐藏状态。

Method: 提出对数线性注意力机制，用对数增长的隐藏状态替代固定大小的隐藏状态，并展示了其可高效并行化的优势。

Result: 通过实例化Mamba-2和GatedDeltaNet的实验证明，对数线性注意力机制在性能上优于线性时间变体。

Conclusion: 对数线性注意力是一种通用框架，可结合现有线性注意力变体，提供更高效的序列建模解决方案。

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

Conclusion: 本文显著改进了重尾线性强盗问题的性能，尤其是在依赖维度d方面，并首次为某些无限维设置了次线性遗憾界。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

Conclusion: 揭示了k-medoids与KDE的结构关系，为VQ中QUBO公式的权重参数提供了新的几何解释。

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

Conclusion: Adam优化器的自适应预处理机制可能导致训练不稳定和损失突增，为优化器设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: 通过逻辑谜题的强化学习可以重塑模型内部推理机制，实现更鲁棒和组合式的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a

EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

Key words: 概念瓶颈模型, 信息瓶颈, 可解释性, 深度学习, 变分正则化

TL;DR: 该论文提出了最小化概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过引入信息瓶颈目标来解决传统概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）未能完全约束信息的问题，从而提升可解释性和干预的可靠性。

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统的概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽然通过学习具体概念的表示提升了可解释性，但其未能真正约束每个表示组件仅编码对应概念的信息，这影响了模型的解释性和干预有效性。

Method: 作者提出了最小化概念瓶颈模型（MCBMs），通过添加信息瓶颈（IB）目标的变分正则项来约束每个表示组件，确保其仅保留与对应概念相关的信息。

Result: MCBMs不仅提供了理论保证支持概念级干预，还保持了与贝叶斯原则的一致性，并在设计上提供了更大的灵活性。

Conclusion: MCBMs通过引入信息瓶颈，有效解决了传统CBMs的局限性，显著提升了模型的可解释性和干预的可靠性。

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Motivation: 髋关节发育不良是骨关节炎的风险因素，早期诊断对手术干预至关重要。

Method: 结合高斯过程潜变量模型和微分同胚，开发了GPDSSM模型，利用192例CT扫描（100训练，92测试）进行分类。

Result: GPDSSM显著区分发育不良样本（AUC 96.2% vs 角度法91.2%），并能识别异常区域。

Conclusion: GPDSSM提高了分类准确率并减少了临床操作时间。

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs
mitigate this issue.

Motivation: ICU患者的早期高风险识别对医疗资源分配至关重要，需要一种鲁棒且高效的方法从临床文本中提取特征。

Method: 提出ALFIA架构，结合LoRA适配器和自适应层加权机制，从BERT中提取多层语义特征，并与GBDT或深度神经网络结合（ALFIA-boost/ALFIA-nn）。

Conclusion: ALFIA为临床医生提供了一种便捷且鲁棒的工具，可直接从常规临床文本中进行风险分层和及时干预。

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,
intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在推理时需要大量计算和能源，而传统的量化方法可能因大值异常导致性能显著下降。因此，需要一种高效的量化方法以保持模型性能。

Method: 引入四种FPTs：（1）可合并的预RoPE变换（查询和键），（2）可合并的值变换，（3）MLP块内的可合并缩放变换，（4）动态缩放变换。通过利用变换器的固有等价性和独立性，保持模型功能的同时优化激活分布以适合量化。

Result: FPTQuant在INT4量化下实现了最高3.9倍的加速，且精度损失极小，仅比慢29%的方法略低。

Conclusion: FPTQuant是一种高效、轻量级的量化方法，显著提升了推理速度并保持了模型性能，适用于大语言模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

Method: 提出"谨慎乐观"框架，将任何FTRL实例转化为加速的无遗憾学习算法，通过最小计算开销调整FTRL的学习步长。

Result: 在自对弈中实现近似最优的O_T(\log T)遗憾，同时在对抗场景中保持最优的O(\sqrt{T})遗憾。

Conclusion: "谨慎乐观"提供了一种新颖的快速学习路径，适用于一般博弈，且不依赖单调步长。

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

Conclusion: CREAM是一种有效的CBM框架，通过显式编码关系实现了高性能和高可解释性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

Conclusion: MPP编码是一种高效的地理空间数据编码方法，适用于机器学习模型。

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

Conclusion: 本文揭示了当前PLL方法的局限性，并为开发更具通用性的PLL模型提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

Conclusion: TIMING通过结合时间意识和传统IG方法的理论特性，显著提升了时间序列XAI的效果。

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证iN2V有效，平均提升节点分类1点，最高6点。

Conclusion: iN2V是一种通用方法，可扩展至其他嵌入方法，适用于归纳式表示学习。

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without
features or to supplement existing features with structure-based information.
Embedding methods like N2V are limited in their application on new nodes, which
restricts them to the transductive setting where the entire graph, including
the test nodes, is available during training. We propose inductive node2vec
(iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes
unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure
to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure. We conduct experiments
on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective
approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using
iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to
6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen
nodes. Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing
embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a
versatile approach for inductive node representation learning. Code to
reproduce the results is available at https://github.com/Foisunt/iN2V .

model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有HiPPO框架假设数据无噪声，但实际应用中数据常受噪声干扰，因此需要一种对噪声更具鲁棒性的初始化方法。

Method: 将HiPPO重新解释为线性随机控制问题，并将数据视为潜在系统的噪声输出，推导出不确定性感知的动态初始化方法。

Result: 实验表明，改进的初始化方法在训练和推理时均提升了模型对噪声的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 通过引入噪声感知的初始化，论文成功增强了状态空间模型在实际噪声环境中的性能。

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

Motivation: 当前半隐式变分推断（SIVI）方法在高维设置中训练时存在高方差和偏差的问题，且训练成本较高。

Method: 提出内核化KL散度估计器，并引入重要性采样校正；理论证明了该方法与Stein变分梯度下降的摊销版本最小化相同目标，但梯度方差更低。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在性能和训练效率上优于或匹配现有SIVI方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过降低梯度方差和偏差，实现了更稳定和高效的优化。

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Result: 发现当生成模型的输入受控时，合成数据可能导致与直接发布模型相同的隐私泄露；而随机输入则可增强隐私保护。

Conclusion: 线性回归的分析结果为未来更广泛的隐私保护理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Conclusion: Morse-Smale 流的结构稳定性为扩散模型在噪声消失时的稳定性提供了理论基础，并通过分岔现象描述了系统间的定性转变。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

Conclusion: TreeRPO通过精细化奖励信号，有效提升模型推理效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and
dense reward signals, significantly enhancing the learning process and overall
performance of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our \name algorithm
substantially improves the average Pass@1 accuracy of Qwen-2.5-Math on test
benchmarks, increasing it from 19.0\% to 35.5\%. Furthermore, \name
significantly outperforms GRPO by 2.9\% in performance while simultaneously
reducing the average response length by 18.1\%, showcasing its effectiveness
and efficiency. Our code will be available at

Conclusion: LPMT通过保持局部一致性和全局检索效率，显著提升检索效果。

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Conclusion: Transformer能够通过上下文学习实现通用表征和动态适应，适用于更广泛的非线性问题。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Result: 在四个数据集上，SHARP在全局和节点度级别均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAR和SHARP能有效缓解GNN中的度偏差，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Conclusion: 分散式鲁棒算法在适当步长和参数$σ$下可实现最优学习率，且$σ$对鲁棒性和收敛性至关重要。

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Conclusion: 该框架为KernelSHAP提供了理论支持，并展示了现有估计方法之间的权衡，同时通过实现改进提高了可扩展性。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长上下文推理时存在二次时间复杂度和线性内存复杂度的问题。RMTs虽然降低了复杂度，但其内存更新机制导致顺序执行，成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入Diagonal Batching调度方案，通过在RMTs中跨段实现并行化，同时保持精确的循环性，避免了顺序约束。

Result: 在LLaMA-1B ARMT模型上，Diagonal Batching相比标准全注意力LLaMA-1B实现了3.3倍加速，相比顺序RMT实现实现了1.8倍加速。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching通过消除顺序瓶颈，降低了推理成本和延迟，使RMTs成为实际长上下文应用的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

Motivation: 现有的神经采样器虽然在采样未归一化密度方面有进展，但其目标评估效率仍不如最先进的MCMC方法并行回火（PT）。同时，PT存在样本依赖性和高计算成本的问题，需要新方法来克服这些不足。

Result: PTSD能够高效复用温度级别间的样本信息，生成混合良好且不相关的样本，显著提升目标评估效率，优于基于扩散的神经采样器。

Conclusion: PTSD在神经采样器训练中结合PT的优势，实现了更高的效率和样本质量，为改进MCMC和神经采样器提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the
process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant
advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach,
Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations.
On the other hand, unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only
dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost
-- whenever new samples are required. To address these weaknesses, we propose
the Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which trains diffusion
models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of PT to
improve the training of neural samplers. We also introduce a novel method to
combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate
lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to
train the next diffusion model. PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample
information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated
samples. Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency,
outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

Method: 通过在线学习规则优化的上下回归目标，改进Mesa层，使其数值稳定且支持分块并行化。使用快速共轭梯度求解器在每个时间点上优化目标。

Result: 实验表明，优化后的Mesa层在语言建模中实现了更低的困惑度和更高的下游任务性能，尤其是在长上下文理解任务中，但增加了推理时的计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过增加推理时的计算资源来解决序列优化问题，可以显著提升模型性能，尤其是在复杂任务中。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

Result: MP-SAE能提取相关特征，并保证重构性能随原子选择单调提升。

Conclusion: 多迭代SAE（MP-SAE）在提取复杂特征方面优于传统浅层SAEs。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

Conclusion: 残差连接对提高训练稳定性至关重要，理论结果在多层Transformer中同样适用。

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

Conclusion: 研究展示了真实改进对机器学习分类的积极影响，并提出了在不同场景下的有效学习策略。

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

Result: RHEL在多种时间序列任务中表现与BPTT相当，且适用于序列长度达50k的长范围任务。

Conclusion: 该工作为设计可扩展、高能效的物理学习系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Result: 提供了EF和EF²¹的最优收敛速率及其理论界限。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析比较了EF、EF²¹和压缩梯度下降的性能，为方法选择提供了依据。

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

Conclusion: CocktailEdit填补了生成建模与实际编辑需求间的空白，提供了灵活的时间序列编辑方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,
offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and
editing. The code and demo are provided for validation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能提升2.5倍以上，训练速度可提高两个数量级。

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley显著提升了计算效率与实用性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Conclusion: L2S方法通过结合世界模型和奖励模型，提升了代理在未见状态下的恢复能力，性能优于传统BC方法。

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

Result: SiftAttention在减少内存带宽使用的同时，更好地保持了模型质量。

Conclusion: SiftAttention显著提升了GPU上大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 穿戴式传感器数据通常存在大量缺失，传统SSL模型假设数据完整，无法直接应用。为了解决这一问题，本文提出了AIM方法。

Method: 通过可学习的掩码标记对现有和人为引入的缺失进行建模，从而在不完整数据上学习鲁棒表示。

Result: 在包含4000万小时多模态传感器数据的预训练中，LSM-2与AIM在分类、回归和生成建模任务中表现最佳，且在针对性缺失场景下仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: AIM是一种适用于真实穿戴式传感器数据的可靠方法，尤其适用于临床相关任务。

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有的QPI成像工具在多散射器条件下提取单散射器QPI模式是一个病态逆问题，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 采用两步学习策略：先训练变分自编码器学习散射核的紧凑潜在空间，再用专用编码器将QPI观测与预学习核的潜在表示对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法提取精度显著提高，且对未见过的核具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该AI框架在多散射条件下能有效解决QPI核提取问题，为量子材料电子结构研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有研究基于计算最优性，忽略了推理时的内存访问瓶颈，导致对小模型效果的过高估计。

Method: 通过分析0.6B至32B参数模型，提出动力学扩展定律，并结合稀疏注意力降低每令牌成本。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低/高成本下分别取得60和5点提升，证明其优于密集模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试时扩展潜力的关键。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

TL;DR: 通过动态内存稀疏化（DMS）压缩KV缓存，实现推理超缩放，提升大模型推理准确率而不增加计算成本。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: Transformer大模型推理成本受限于KV缓存大小，而生成更多token能提升准确率，故探索通过压缩KV缓存实现超缩放。

Method: 提出动态内存稀疏化（DMS），仅需1K训练步骤实现8倍压缩，延迟token丢弃以保留关键信息。

Result: DMS在多种大模型上验证有效，如Qwen-R1 32B在多个基准上平均提升9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: 推理超缩放结合DMS可在相同计算预算下显著提升模型准确率。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“嫁接”（grafting）的方法，通过对预训练扩散变换器（DiTs）进行编辑，以低成本研究新架构设计。实验表明，该方法在低计算预算下能有效提升模型质量。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究新架构设计通常需要昂贵的预训练成本，限制了架构探索。作者受软件开发的启发，尝试通过编辑预训练模型来研究新设计。

Method: 提出嫁接方法，通过替换预训练DiTs中的操作（如注意力机制）或结构（如深度、宽度），构建混合设计并评估其性能。

Result: 混合设计在低计算预算下（<2%预训练成本）取得了与基准模型（DiT-XL/2）接近的质量（FID: 2.38-2.64）。在文本到图像模型中，嫁接还实现了1.43倍加速且性能下降少于2%。

Conclusion: 嫁接方法为探索扩散模型的新设计提供了一种高效途径，展示了从操作替换到结构调整的可行性。

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

Motivation: 传统方法在切换基础模型时需要重新训练，但常因数据限制难以实现。ProLoRA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将源模型的调整投影到目标模型的权重空间，利用子空间和零空间相似性，并选择性对齐层。

Result: 在现有文本到图像模型上的评估表明，ProLoRA成功实现了知识转移，且性能与重新训练相当。

Conclusion: ProLoRA为无需重新训练的模型适应性提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 随着自主代理为用户做决策的时代到来，确保上下文完整性（CI）——即在执行特定任务时分享何种信息是适当的——成为核心问题。作者认为CI需要代理对其操作环境进行推理。

Method: 首先通过提示大语言模型（LLM）显式推理CI，然后开发了一个强化学习（RL）框架，进一步培养模型实现CI所需的推理能力。使用了一个合成数据集（约700个示例）进行验证。

Result: 方法显著减少了不恰当的信息披露，同时在多种模型大小和家族中保持了任务性能。改进还泛化到了如PrivacyLens等CI基准测试中。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合显式推理和RL框架的方法能有效提升代理的上下文完整性决策能力，且具有泛化性。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Conclusion: LLM-MARL为智能、协作型多智能体系统设计提供了新方向，展现了LLMs在多智能体领域的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but

achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%

Conclusion: HADA通过框架无关的利益相关者代理提升了多代理系统中决策的准确性、透明度和伦理合规性。

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Result: 在Webshop和Crafter上的实验表明，EXIF能有效发现技能并显著提升智能体性能，无需人工干预。

Conclusion: EXIF框架能够通过闭环数据生成和自我评估实现智能体的自我进化。

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Conclusion: 该框架支持低成本推理模拟，为研究和预测LM中的关键转变（如非对齐状态或失败）提供了工具。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在单表问答中表现出色，但在多表问答中因复杂的模式链接问题表现不佳，尤其是在真实场景中。

Method: 提出基于图的框架，显式编码模式链接和连接路径，结合剪枝和子路径合并策略构建推理链。

Result: 在标准基准和真实大规模数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个应用于复杂工业数据的多表问答系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 传统警报系统难以应对现代公共卫生数据的高数据量和动态变化，需要新的监控方法。

Method: 采用基于排名和AI异常检测的监控范式，通过与AI技术的多学科合作实现。

Result: 系统已在全国组织中部署，每日监控500万数据点，3个月评估显示审查效率提升54倍。

Conclusion: 展示了人本AI在公共卫生决策中的潜力。

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential
of human-centered AI to transform public health decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理排序偏好和组合算法任务中的局限性，特别是在匹配市场中的表现。研究发现，即使是性能最好的模型也难以解决大市场中的不稳定性问题，而参数高效微调（LoRA）对小市场有效但对大市场效果有限。

<details>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理任务中表现优异，但在处理排序偏好和结构化算法的组合领域尚未充分探索。匹配市场作为资源分配和共享经济的核心框架，需要结合个人排序偏好以确保稳定结果，研究LLMs在此类任务中的表现具有重要价值。

Method: 研究对多个最先进的LLMs模型进行了一系列偏好推理任务的评估，包括稳定匹配生成、不稳定性检测、解除不稳定性及细粒度偏好查询，并对比了参数高效微调（LoRA）在小市场和大市场中的效果。

Result: 研究发现，即使是最先进的LLMs在大市场中解决不稳定性问题时表现不佳，经常无法识别阻碍对或迭代执行算法。LoRA对小市场性能提升显著，但对大市场效果有限。

Conclusion: 当前的LLMs在处理大规模排序偏好和复杂算法任务时存在明显局限性，需要更先进的策略来提升其推理能力，特别是在大上下文输入的情况下。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 现有评估方法仅依赖整体答案准确性，无法真实评估LLMs的数学能力。

Method: CogMath将人类推理过程分为3阶段（问题理解、问题解决、解决方案总结），并设计了9个细粒度维度进行多代理评估。

Result: 7个主流LLMs的数学能力被高估30%-40%，并定位了其在不同阶段/维度的优劣势。

Conclusion: CogMath为LLMs的数学能力提供了更全面的评估方法，并揭示了改进方向。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 自然语言中的复杂空间、数学和条件约束难以直接应用于规划算法，需要一种高效翻译方法。

Method: STPR框架利用LLM将‘禁止事项’类自然语言指令转化为Python函数，结合传统搜索算法处理点云数据。

Result: 实验证明STPR能准确描述复杂数学约束，在仿真环境中完全符合约束且运行时间短。

Conclusion: STPR不仅兼容大模型，也适用于小型代码专用LLM，具备低推理成本。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

Conclusion: LLMs在自动模式生成中表现出色，同时为结构化生成任务提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

Conclusion: OpenAg旨在弥合科学知识与农民经验之间的差距，支持可扩展且本地相关的农业决策。

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Conclusion: GUI-Critic-R1通过预操作反馈机制有效提升了GUI自动化任务的可靠性和效率，填补了相关数据空白。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 当前法律领域的NLP数据集缺乏专注于推理任务的内容，特别是在企业治理领域，因此需要一个新的基准来评估模型的法律推理能力。

Method: 基准由真实企业章程和行动提案组成，模型需进行二元分类判断，基于24条企业治理原则和79份真实章程构建。

Result: SOTA模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet和GPT-4o）准确率分别为64.5%和75.2%，而基于ReAct和CodeAct框架的推理代理表现更优（76.1%和78.1%）。

Conclusion: CHANCERY基准揭示了现有模型在法律推理上的局限性，并为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced

Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role
specialization and price fluctuations in line with market rules.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Motivation: 研究揭示了现有推理模型（如Deepseek-R1-Distill系列）在基准评估中的结果波动问题，影响了性能改进的可信度，因此需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过实证评估分析了Deepseek-R1-Distill系列模型在不同条件下的表现波动问题。

Result: 评估结果显示，模型性能的改进因评估条件差异而难以复现。

Conclusion: 作者呼吁建立更严格的性能评估范式以提高模型评价的可靠性和可复现性。

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been
widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in
mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant
fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation
conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are
observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model
performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Result: 框架展示了标准化结构和可复用组件的扩展潜力，但实验验证因数据集和计算资源限制尚未完成。

Conclusion: 该研究为骨疾病诊断提供了理论框架，未来需扩展数据集和验证系统。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems frequently lack systematic
domain expertise integration, potentially compromising diagnostic reliability.
This study presents an ontology-based framework for bone disease diagnosis,
developed in collaboration with Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Traumatology and
Orthopedics. The framework introduces three theoretical contributions: (1) a
hierarchical neural network architecture guided by bone disease ontology for
segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that
integrates imaging, clinical, and laboratory data through ontological
relationships. The methodology maintains clinical interpretability through
systematic knowledge digitization, standardized medical terminology mapping,
and modular architecture design. The framework demonstrates potential for
extension beyond bone diseases through its standardized structure and reusable
components. While theoretical foundations are established, experimental
validation remains pending due to current dataset and computational resource
limitations. Future work will focus on expanding the clinical dataset and
conducting comprehensive system validation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种安全关键连续控制任务中显著优于非自适应方法，同时优化了性能与安全性。

Conclusion: 所提框架在安全与性能之间取得平衡，适用于现实应用场景。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Result: 模拟器实现了真实场景下的攻防行为，验证了不同防御策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 多代理方法能够有效模拟网络攻防动态，为防御策略的优化提供了实验基础。

Abstract: As cyber-attacks show to be more and more complex and coordinated,
cyber-defenders strategy through multi-agent approaches could be key to tackle
against cyber-attacks as close as entry points in a networked system. This
paper presents a Markovian modeling and implementation through a simulator of
fighting cyber-attacker agents and cyber-defender agents deployed on host
network nodes. It aims to provide an experimental framework to implement
realistically based coordinated cyber-attack scenarios while assessing
cyber-defenders dynamic organizations. We abstracted network nodes by sets of
properties including agents' ones. Actions applied by agents model how the
network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

Method: LLMs基于环境描述生成初始策略，通过反馈和感知数据迭代优化策略。

Result: 在Gymnasium和MuJoCo的经典控制任务中，多数情况下能找到最优或高性能解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合符号推理与环境交互数据，显著提升了智能体性能。

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

Result: 实现89%的欺骗检测准确率，并通过激活引导成功在40%的情况下诱导上下文相关的欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 揭示了推理模型的诚实性问题，为可信AI对齐提供了工具和方法。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

Conclusion: 该方法在可编程物质和鲁棒计算系统方面具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

Conclusion: 该研究为资源波动环境下的自主系统提供了理论和架构基础，实现自我调节的持久运行。

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Method: 提出RAG-UAV框架，结合检索机制为LLM提供相关领域文献支持，并使用UAV-Math-Bench进行评估。

Result: 检索增强显著提高答案准确率（最高75%），降低公式选择错误（从25%降至5%），并大幅减少数值误差。

Conclusion: RAG-UAV为LLM在工程分析中提供了更可靠的工具，但实时飞行控制仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

Conclusion: 内在元认知学习是实现持续、通用和自我对齐的自我改进的关键，需进一步优化人机协作和评估方法。

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 传统的搜索方法如蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）依赖固定的探索超参数，难以适应不同难度的任务，导致效率低下或成本高昂。

Method: LFS通过LLM自主控制搜索路径，基于其内部评分机制决定继续当前路径或探索新分支，无需预先定义的搜索策略或手动调整。

Result: 在Countdown和Sudoku任务中，LFS在未额外调整的情况下表现优于ToT-BFS、BestFS和MCTS，且计算效率更高、扩展性更强。

Conclusion: LFS展示了LLM自主搜索的潜力，能够在不依赖外部启发式的情况下实现灵活且高效的推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时生成过多令牌导致计算浪费，且难以根据不同问题的难度动态调整生成长度，因此需要一种自适应的方法来优化令牌使用。

Result: 在DeepScaleR-1.5B模型上应用ALP后，平均令牌使用减少50%，且性能无显著下降，同时能在固定预算下更智能地分配计算资源。

Conclusion: ALP显著减少计算资源浪费，同时提升对困难问题的处理能力，是一种高效的自适应令牌优化方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Conclusion: 该框架通过连接安全保证与成本，促进了AI控制的经济可行性评估。

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

Main category: nlin.PS

Motivation: 传统基于导数的方法（如SINDy）需要密集采样且对噪声敏感，因此需要一个更鲁棒的方法来处理稀疏和不规则数据。

Method: 使用Neural ODEs直接建模矩轨迹，并通过Stiefel流形优化引入数据驱动的坐标变换策略，以实现对无闭合系统的低维表示。

Result: 在非线性薛定谔方程中准确恢复闭合的矩动力学；在Fisher-KPP系统中，即使无闭合模型，Neural ODEs仍能有效近似矩动力学并优于物理专家推导的模型。

Conclusion: Neural ODE框架是一种强大且灵活的工具，可用于学习复杂PDE系统中可解释的低维矩动力学。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.

Conclusion: AbBiBench提供了一个统一的、基于生物学的评估框架，促进更有效的功能感知抗体设计模型的开发。

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

*Salil Patel*

Key words: 潜在空间假设, 多模态医学数据, 个性化医疗, 疾病轨迹, 临床实践

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将多模态医学数据映射到统一潜在空间的框架，用于个性化医疗诊断与治疗。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: q-bio.QM

Motivation: 研究旨在解决医学数据的异质性问题，通过潜在空间假设揭示疾病的本质及其动态变化。

Method: 利用潜在空间假设将多模态数据映射到统一层次化流形中，通过几何表示分析疾病轨迹和治疗向量。

Result: 框架能够揭示疾病的子轨迹和个体化变化方向，为个性化诊断和治疗提供定量依据。

Conclusion: 该框架为临床实践提供了从标签分组转向个体化轨迹导航的新方法，但仍面临数据偏见和隐私等挑战。

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于扩展的方法（CEGAR）用于量化整数规划（QIP），并将其应用于多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题，实验证明其性能优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.DM

Motivation: 量化整数规划（QIP）因其能够结合整数变量、线性约束和变量量化，成为解决复杂决策和多阶段鲁棒优化问题的强大工具。目前，QIP的研究主要集中在基于搜索的方法上，而基于扩展的方法尚未被充分探索。

Method: 作者引入了基于扩展的方法（利用CEGAR技术）来处理QIP，并将其扩展至多阶段鲁棒离散优化问题。该方法还嵌入了一个优化框架，提高了其适用性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在特定实例中优于现有的基于搜索的QIP求解器，并在线性约束问题上表现优于最先进的基于扩展的QBF求解器。

Conclusion: 通过引入基于扩展的方法，QIP的求解能力得到显著提升，尤其是在多阶段鲁棒优化问题中，展示了其优越性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视觉定位和分割方面缺乏显式机制的问题，弥合理性推理与视觉感知之间的鸿沟。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：推理阶段通过多模态链式思维视觉提示生成可解释的区域提案；分割阶段通过视觉语言分割模块（VLSM）结合文本与视觉线索细化分割掩码。

Result: 在ReasonSeg上比现有方法高出+6.5 gIoU和+9.2 cIoU，在SegInW零样本设置下达到49.7 mAP。

Conclusion: RSVP为可解释的推理分割提供了新范式，验证了其将认知推理与结构化视觉理解结合的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Key words: 多模态大语言模型, 多图像推理, 基准评估, GPT-4o, 开源LLM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个多模态多图像推理基准（MMRB），用于评估多图像结构的视觉推理能力，填补了现有MLLM在多图像推理任务上的空白。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有MLLM基准主要关注单图像推理或多图像理解任务的最终答案评估，缺乏对多图像推理能力的系统研究，因此需要一个新的基准来评估这一能力。

Method: 设计并构建了包含92个子任务的MMRB，涵盖空间、时间和语义推理任务，使用GPT-4o和人类专家生成多解和CoT式标注，并提出基于开源LLM的句子级匹配框架用于快速评估。

Result: 在40个MLLM上的实验表明，开源MLLM在多图像推理任务中显著落后于商业MLLM，且当前多模态奖励模型几乎无法处理多图像奖励排名任务。

Conclusion: MMRB为多图像推理任务提供了系统的评估基准，揭示了开源MLLM和奖励模型在多图像场景中的不足。

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 冰球检测在视频中面临尺寸小、遮挡多等问题，现有方法未能充分利用球员行为的上下文信息。

Method: PLUCC结合了上下文编码器、特征金字塔编码器和门控解码器，通过球员行为和多尺度特征进行定位。

Result: 在PuckDataset上，PLUCC的平均精度提升了12.2%，RSLE平均精度提升了25%。

Conclusion: 上下文理解对提升冰球检测性能至关重要，为自动化体育分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2% and RSLE average precision of 25%. Our research demonstrates the critical
role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection performance, with
broad implications for automated sports analysis.

Motivation: 尽管DNN编码模型能预测大脑对视觉刺激的反应，但缺乏对具体特征的洞察。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用预训练的Inception V3网络提取多层激活，通过线性回归预测fMRI响应，应用激活最大化生成图像。

Result: 生成的图像能可靠地驱动目标脑区活动，与已知的选择性特征一致。

Conclusion: 激活最大化可成功应用于DNN编码模型，为研究视觉系统提供了灵活工具。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

Motivation: VAR在图像生成中存在图像质量下降、序列长度超线性增长以及采样调度不可变的问题，HMAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: HMAR采用马尔可夫过程和多步掩码生成策略，并开发了高效的注意力核以减少计算开销。

Conclusion: HMAR不仅提升了图像生成质量和效率，还提供了无需重新训练的采样调度灵活性和零样本图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

Method: 结合视觉惯性束调整（VIBA）校准滚动快门RGB相机的高频轨迹，并在高斯泼溅方法中引入物理图像形成模型。

Result: 在所有实验中，通过VIBA和图像形成模型，PSNR分别提高了+1 dB。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在高动态范围真实感场景重建中表现优秀，显著提升了视觉质量。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Method: 通过分析LlaVA-Next模型的残差流，识别线性可解码的ImageNet类特征；使用目标编辑验证其因果性；训练多模态SAEs以增强特征的多样性。

Result: 发现模型中存在多样的线性可解码图像特征，且这些特征是因果性的；更深层次中，跨模态表示逐渐共享。

Conclusion: 多模态语言模型的图像表示具有线性可解码性和因果性；跨模态表示在深层网络中趋于共享。

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

Key words: 多模态大语言模型,数据选择,认知样本,计算效率,强化学习

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP)的数据选择范式，通过识别关键认知样本来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，仅需9.3%的训练数据即可实现优于全数据集的性能。

<details>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 传统方法认为多模态大语言模型需要大量训练数据以提高推理能力，但存在数据冗余和计算成本高的问题。本文挑战了这一假设，发现仅有少数关键样本（认知样本）能够显著提升模型的多模态推理能力。

Method: 提出了RAP数据选择范式，包括两个互补的估计器：Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE)和Attention Confidence Estimator (ACE)，分别用于消除依赖语言先验的样本和丢弃注意力分布不合理的样本。同时引入Difficulty-aware Replacement Module (DRM)以增加数据复杂度。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，RAP方法仅使用9.3%的训练数据即可实现优于全数据集的性能，同时减少超过43%的计算成本。

Conclusion: RAP通过高效选择关键认知样本，显著提升了多模态推理的效率与性能，证明了小规模高质量数据足以替代大规模数据集的可能性。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 传统的客观街道指标无法捕捉城市设计中主观感知的重要性，MSEF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用视觉转换器（VisualGLM-6B）和大语言模型（GPT-4）结合LoRA和P-Tuning v2微调，分析15,000张哈尔滨街景图像。

Result: 模型在客观特征上F1得分为0.84，与居民感知的一致性达89.3%，揭示了非线性感知模式和语境依赖矛盾。

Conclusion: MSEF为城市感知建模提供创新方法，支持规划系统兼顾基础设施精度和生活体验。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在理解和准确性上仍未达到人类水平。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频语言基准测试中取得最佳性能，证明了数据集和模型的有效性。

Conclusion: VideoMarathon和Hour-LLaVA为长时间视频理解任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 传统IQA模型容易受到对抗性攻击，现行方法（如对抗训练）依赖数据驱动的防御，作者质疑这是否是正确方向，提出从设计角度解决鲁棒性问题。

Method: 通过调整模型内部结构，强制正交信息流和规范保持操作，结合剪枝和微调，从架构层面提升鲁棒性，避免对抗训练。

Result: 提出的IQA架构在不依赖对抗训练或大幅改动原模型的情况下，能够有效抵御对抗攻击，验证了通过设计实现鲁棒性的可行性。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性应从设计角度而非数据驱动角度优化，这一思路为IQA及其他感知模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法依赖固定扰动预算，未能考虑实例特定的鲁棒性特征。

Method: 提出了动态epsilon调度（DES），结合梯度代理、softmax熵和蒙特卡洛dropout，动态调整扰动预算。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，DES优于固定预算和现有自适应方法，提高了鲁棒性和标准准确率。

Conclusion: DES为实例感知、数据驱动的对抗训练方法开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow通过统一的条件生成框架，显著提升了点云处理的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 为了解决现有3D布局生成方法因数据集有限而导致的过拟合或灵活性不足问题，以及满足用户细粒度指令需求。

Method: DirectLayout采用三阶段生成流程：鸟瞰图布局生成、3D空间提升和对象放置优化，并引入Chain-of-Thought激活和生成奖励机制。

Result: 实验表明，DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化能力和物理合理性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout通过结合LLMs空间推理和上下文学习，显著提升了3D布局生成的开放性和用户指令对齐能力。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: RAS框架能够有效提升多模态交互下的分割性能，为复杂查询提供更全面的语义理解。

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer
to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with
complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large
multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets
MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by
text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate
superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring
expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation

Motivation: 解决ANNS结果过于相似的问题，确保结果既相似又多样。

Conclusion: LotusFilter有效提升了ANNS结果的多样性且高效。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 研究神经网络训练中的记忆行为对于防止敏感信息泄露和提升知识密集型任务效果至关重要，尤其是多模态模型的广泛应用使得跨模态记忆机制成为研究重点。

Method: 通过构建合成人物数据集，量化单模态训练下模型在另一模态中的表现，探索跨模态可迁移性，并分析不同场景（如更强大模型、机器遗忘和多跳情况）下的表现差异。

Result: 研究发现跨模态记忆存在显著差距，即源模态与目标模态之间的信息回忆能力不一致，且这种差距在不同场景下普遍存在。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁未来研究开发更鲁棒的多模态学习技术以提高跨模态可迁移性，并提出了一个基线方法作为初步解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

TL;DR: 论文摘要探讨了医疗领域中可解释AI（XAI）的重要性，并提出两种新模型VCT和SVCT，通过结合概念特征与图像特征提升性能与稳定性，实验证明其在医疗数据上的优越性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 医疗领域对透明度的需求促使研究者探索可解释AI。现有概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）虽受欢迎，但依赖单一概念特征且性能不稳定，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出Vision Concept Transformer（VCT）和Stable Vision Concept Transformer（SVCT），后者基于VIT架构，融合概念层与图像特征，并引入去噪扩散平滑技术提升稳定性。

Result: 在四个医疗数据集上的实验表明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确性的同时具有可解释性，SVCT在对抗扰动时仍能提供稳定解释。

Conclusion: VCT和SVCT解决了CBMs在医疗领域的性能与稳定性问题，兼顾了模型的准确性与可解释性，适合医疗应用。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

Abstract: The burgeoning growth of the esports and multiplayer online gaming community
has highlighted the critical importance of evaluating the Most Valuable Player
(MVP). The establishment of an explainable and practical MVP evaluation method
is very challenging. In our study, we specifically focus on play-by-play data,
which records related events during the game, such as assists and points. We
aim to address the challenges by introducing a new MVP evaluation framework,
denoted as \oursys, which leverages Shapley values. This approach encompasses
feature processing, win-loss model training, Shapley value allocation, and MVP
ranking determination based on players' contributions. Additionally, we
optimize our algorithm to align with expert voting results from the perspective
of causality. Finally, we substantiated the efficacy of our method through
validation using the NBA dataset and the Dunk City Dynasty dataset and
implemented online deployment in the industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.GR

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义的噪声调度，常导致感知不一致；新方法旨在保持结构保真度并提升感知质量。

Method: 引入SSIMBaD（基于SSIM的平衡扩散和Sigma缩放），通过σ空间变换线性对齐感知退化。

Result: 在大规模动画人脸数据集上的实验表明，该方法在像素精度和感知质量上均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 新框架在保持结构的同时有效传递风格属性，且能泛化到多样风格。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Main category: cs.DC

Motivation: 现有MoE模型实现存在GPU利用率低、延迟高、无法利用任务局部性的问题。

Method: 开发FlashDMoE，通过单持续GPU内核和细粒度流水线优化，减少启动开销和空闲时间。

Result: 在8-H100 GPU节点上，FlashDMoE实现了6倍延迟降低、5.7倍吞吐量提升、4倍弱扩展效率提升和9倍GPU利用率提升。

Conclusion: 通过GPU内核-硬件协同设计可以突破大规模分布式ML工作负载的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

Abstract: This paper draws attention to the potential of computational methods in
reworking data generated in past qualitative studies. While qualitative
inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the
development of innovative research designs. Finally, we enumerate some key
challenges and ongoing concerns associated with qualitative data sharing and
reuse.

Conclusion: ChemReservoir是一个通用且稳定的开源工具，填补了现有研究的不足。

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Result: 在102个手工整理的基因集上测试，cGSA比基准方法性能提升30%以上，专家验证证实其精确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: cGSA在黑色素瘤和乳腺癌案例中展示了其在发现上下文特异性见解和支持靶向假设生成方面的潜力。

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在复杂3D场景中空间定位和动态推理的不足。

Method: 提出RoboRefer，结合了监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT），并引入RefSpatial数据集。

Result: SFT训练的RoboRefer在空间理解上达到89.6%的成功率，RFT训练的版本在RefSpatial-Bench上超过Gemini-2.5-Pro 17.4%。

Conclusion: RoboRefer在复杂空间推理任务中表现优异，并能应用于多样化机器人平台。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the

the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable

the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim

significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

Conclusion: 该技术有望在需要快速电化学定量的领域（如嗅觉和电化学分析的多路复用）中广泛应用。

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

### [297] [Domain Adaptation Method and Modality Gap Impact in Audio-Text Models for Prototypical Sound Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04376)
*Emiliano Acevedo,Martín Rocamora,Magdalena Fuentes*

Key words: 零样本分类、环境声音、背景声源、域适应、模态差距

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新方法，通过量化并整合背景声源对分类的影响，改进零样本环境声音分类性能，无需重新训练模型。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 现有的音频-文本模型在背景声源存在时性能显著下降，需解决这一问题以提高分类准确性。

Method: 提出一种域适应技术，量化背景声源的贡献，并缩小音频与文本嵌入之间的模态差距。

Result: 方法在多种背景和信噪比条件下提升了分类准确性，并适用于现有的原型方法。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，能有效改进环境声音分类性能。

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 解决现有方法在音素和韵律标签生成中与字素不一致的问题，以适用于文本到语音和口音估计等下游任务。

Method: 1) 使用预训练BERT特征的提示编码器隐式条件字素；2) 在推理时显式剪枝与字素不一致的标签假设。

Result: 显著提高了标签与字素的一致性，并在口音估计任务中提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够生成与字素一致的音素和韵律标签，适用于多种下游任务，效果显著。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

<details>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 传统的WFST解码在音素驱动的ASR中存在复杂性和无法利用大型语言模型的限制，为了解决这些问题并提高跨语言ASR的性能。

Method: 提出了LLM-P2G方法，包含语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字素（P2G）两个阶段，并通过数据增强（DANP）和随机化Top-K边缘化训练（TKM）策略优化性能。

Result: 在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR任务中，LLM-P2G相比WFST系统分别降低了3.6%和6.9%的相对词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G通过改进解码和训练策略，有效提升了音素驱动ASR的性能，尤其适用于跨语言场景。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Method: 采用人类计算方法，聚合用户评分作为损失函数，使用遗传算法结合反馈优化模型。

Result: 初步测试显示，迭代后用户评分平均提高0.2（第一轮）和0.39（第二轮）。

Conclusion: 通过用户反馈迭代优化显著提升了AI音乐生成的性能和个性化。

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

We determined the basic model architectures by selecting 60 relevant papers

we highlight the main future trends and research gaps for LLM-based credit
scoring systems. This paper aims to be a reference paper for artificial

Result: TQml Simulator在多数情况下比Pennylane的默认模拟器快2至100倍。

Conclusion: 针对特定门层优化模拟方法可大幅提升量子机器学习模拟效率。

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

Motivation: 现有攻击缺乏隐蔽性，容易被检测，因此需要更隐蔽的攻击方式，同时研究防御方法的有效性。

Method: 提出基于注意力模式的Normalized Passage Attention Score和Attention-Variance Filter算法，用于检测和过滤中毒段落。

Result: 防御方法显著提高了准确性（约20%），但适应性攻击仍能达到35%的成功率。

Conclusion: 注意力模式防御有效但不完美，适应性攻击揭示了进一步改进隐蔽性的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 针对医疗数据敏感的隐私问题，研究旨在通过差分隐私技术减少数据泄漏风险。

Method: 使用MIMIC-CXR和CT-RATE数据集，采用差分隐私低秩适应（DP-LoRA）技术在高低隐私预算下微调LLMs，评估模型性能。

Result: 在中等隐私保证下，模型表现接近非隐私基线，MIMIC-CXR和CT-RATE的加权F1分数分别为0.88和0.59。

Conclusion: 差分隐私微调技术能有效保护医疗数据隐私，同时保持多异常分类性能。

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 在基于扰动的防御下，传统的编码器窃取攻击性能受限，因此需要一种方法来提升攻击效果。

Method: BESA包括两个核心模块：扰动检测和扰动恢复。扰动检测模块通过目标编码器的特征向量推断防御机制，扰动恢复模块利用生成模型恢复干净特征向量。

Result: BESA显著提升了现有编码器窃取攻击的准确性，在面对最先进防御和多防御组合时，最高提升24.63%。

Conclusion: BESA能够有效克服基于扰动的防御，为编码器窃取攻击提供了更强的适应性。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing

automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CR

Motivation: 序列模型可能无意中泄露敏感信息，现有工具难以有效审计这种风险，研究者认为这是因为工具假设与实际情况不符。

Method: 通过改进最先进的成员推理攻击方法，使其显式建模序列内的相关性，从而更适应序列模型的结构。

Result: 改进后的方法在不增加计算成本的情况下，显著提升了隐私泄露审计的效果。

Conclusion: 研究为大型序列模型的可靠隐私审计提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone
toward reliable memorization audits for large sequence models.

Main category: cs.AR

Motivation: 由于公开可用的Verilog代码量远少于如Python等软件语言，限制了大型语言模型在硬件代码生成领域的潜力。

Method: 提出hdl2v数据集，通过翻译VHDL、Chisel和PyMTL3为Verilog，并验证其在增强LLM生成Verilog代码中的有效性。

Result: 使用hdl2v数据集后，32B开源模型的性能在VerilogEvalV2中提升了23%，基于数据增强的微调方法性能提升了63%。

Conclusion: hdl2v数据集显著提升了LLM在Verilog生成任务中的表现，并为进一步优化HDL-to-Verilog数据集提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

Main category: cs.AR

Motivation: 传统处理器芯片设计方法面临物理限制、资源需求和生态系统多样性三大挑战，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: QiMeng系统分为三层：底层构建领域特异性大模型（LPCM），中间层开发硬件和软件设计代理，顶层应用实现全自动化设计。

Result: 部分组件已成功应用，展示显著优势，为高效自动化设计提供可行方案。

Conclusion: 未来研究将整合所有组件，建立完整的QiMeng系统。

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Key words: 洗钱检测, 图分析, 可解释性, fraud detection, smurfing

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为GARG-AML的新型基于图的方法，通过单个可解释的指标量化洗钱风险，解决了传统黑箱方法的局限性，并在计算效率、检测能力和透明度之间取得了平衡。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SI

Motivation: 洗钱占全球GDP的2%-5%，传统黑箱网络嵌入方法阻碍了其在商业中的采用，需要一种更透明且高效的方法来检测复杂的洗钱手法（如拆分大额交易的smurfing）。

Method: GARG-AML通过分析每个节点的二阶交易网络结构，生成一个可解释的指标，并结合树基方法和邻居节点的分数来增强其检测能力。

Result: 在大规模合成和开源网络上的实验表明，GARG-AML优于当前最先进的smurfing检测方法。

Conclusion: GARG-AML展示了利用基本网络属性和二阶邻接矩阵在欺诈检测中的潜力，为现有的AML工作流提供了高效且透明的解决方案。

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

Key words: IMPT, Monte Carlo, 降噪, 扩散变换器, 自适应放疗

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散变换器的降噪框架，用于加速低统计量蒙特卡罗（MC）剂量图的计算，从而实现快速高质量的剂量生成，适用于头颈部、肺部、乳腺和前列腺等多种癌症治疗场景。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: physics.med-ph

Motivation: 为了解决强度调制质子治疗（IMPT）中因解剖结构变化需要频繁适应的问题，同时克服传统蒙特卡罗模拟计算速度慢或精度低的矛盾，研究提出了一种降噪方法以实现快速高精度的剂量计算。

Method: 研究开发了一种基于扩散变换器的降噪框架，利用80例头颈部癌症患者的IMPT计划和3D CT图像生成噪声和高质量MC剂量图，并通过多种损失函数（MSE、残差损失和区域MAE）训练模型。

Result: 模型在不同癌症类型中表现出色，MAE值分别为头颈部0.195 Gy[RBE]、肺部0.120 Gy[RBE]、乳腺0.172 Gy[RBE]和前列腺0.376 Gy[RBE]，3D Gamma通过率超过92%，DVH指标与真实值高度吻合。

Conclusion: 该降噪框架仅通过头颈部数据训练，即可泛化到多种癌症类型，为快速高精度的剂量计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease
sites.

Motivation: 旨在通过网格结构模拟生物神经元的局部交互，提高模型的生物合理性和计算效率。

Method: 使用基于网格的结构结合Izhikevich模型，优化神经元间的局部交互和连接。

Result: 模型在计算效率和生物准确性上表现优异，适用于大规模模拟和神经科学研究。

Conclusion: GAIN模型为神经网络的生物合理性模拟提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: q-bio.NC

Motivation: 传统方法速度快但泛化能力差，Transformer泛化强但计算成本高，需要一种兼快速与泛化的解决方案。

Method: 采用跨注意力模块进行单峰标记化，结合状态空间模型（SSM）作为主干，支持多数据集预训练。

Result: POSSM在猴子和人类任务中达到与Transformer相当的精度，推理速度提升9倍，且跨物种迁移表现突出。

Conclusion: 混合SSM在准确性、速度与泛化之间取得了平衡，适合实时闭环应用神经解码器。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练语言模型（CodeBERT 和 CodeT5）在自动化漏洞修复中的应用，发现CodeBERT在上下文不完整时表现更好，而CodeT5在复杂漏洞模式上更具优势，但两者在面对未知数据时泛化能力有限。

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: 软件漏洞对安全构成重大威胁，而传统的自动化程序修复（APR）在漏洞修复方面研究不足，因此本文探讨预训练模型的潜力。

Method: 使用CodeBERT和CodeT5在六个数据集和四种语言中进行自动化漏洞修复实验，评估其在已知和未知漏洞上的表现。

Result: CodeBERT在上下文不完整的场景中表现更优，CodeT5则能更好地捕捉复杂漏洞模式并具有更好的扩展性，但两者对未知数据的泛化能力较弱。

Conclusion: 预训练模型在漏洞修复中表现出潜力，但泛化能力仍需提升，为实际安全应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Conclusion: 神经网络离散化结合Rayleigh商和Gram-Schmidt正交化方法为连续特征值问题提供了简单且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

Motivation: 研究开放式ALife系统是否能够实现持续的开放进化（OEE），传统封闭系统在这方面表现不佳。

Method: 利用DePIN和区块链技术，结合TEEs，部署LLM-AI代理并使其在真实环境中自主运行，通过Spore.fun实验观察代理行为和进化轨迹。

Result: Spore.fun展示了代理在开放系统中的自主进化和行为模式，为OEE的实现提供了新的研究途径。

Conclusion: 开放的ALife系统结合经济激励和技术创新可能实现持续的OEE，但仍需进一步讨论和验证。

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MA

Motivation: 灾后环境复杂，现有传感技术面临适应性差、专业化不足等问题，亟需高效的信息采集解决方案。

Method: HoAs-PALN通过自适应降维将五维匹配转为两类三维匹配，并结合局部纳什均衡博弈优化行为选择概率。

Result: 实验表明，HoAs-PALN平均任务完成率高于基线算法64.12%、46.48%、16.55%和14.03%，且每次调度决策时间少于10秒。

Conclusion: HoAs-PALN在动态灾后环境中表现优异，显著提升了救援效率。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Key words: LLM, 异步通信, 代理, Mafia游戏

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种异步LLM代理，用于决定何时说话而不仅仅是内容，并在在线Mafia游戏中表现与人类相当。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.MA

Motivation: 现有LLM主要用于同步通信，而许多现实场景是异步的（如群聊、团队会议），因此开发能决定说话时机的代理至关重要。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，通过收集在线Mafia游戏数据集来评估其性能。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和融入度上与人类相当，说话时机行为与人类接近，但消息内容存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM融入现实人类群体场景（如团队讨论、教育环境）提供了基础。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Key words: 犯罪受害,社会经济因素,逻辑回归,暴力犯罪,财产犯罪

TL;DR: 利用1992年至2022年的国家犯罪受害调查，分析收入、教育、就业和人口因素如何影响犯罪类型（暴力与财产）。结果显示，经济和教育水平高的群体更少遭受暴力犯罪，而男性、年轻人和少数族裔面临更高的暴力犯罪风险。

<details>

Main category: physics.soc-ph

Motivation: 探讨社会经济和人口因素对犯罪受害类型的影响，以制定更有针对性的干预措施。

Method: 使用平衡分类和逻辑回归模型（F1评分评估），分两组模型（经济驱动和人口控制）进行分析。

Result: 高收入和高等教育降低暴力犯罪风险；郊区模型预测效果最佳，农村犯罪仍难以预测。

Conclusion: 需针对不同地区（如大城市教育投资、农村经济支持）和人口特点制定预防策略。

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 解决现有BGP异常检测方法依赖专家知识的问题，提升网络管理的自动化水平。

Method: 结合多步推理和大语言模型，将表格数据转化为文本叙述，并利用LLM生成合成数据。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上，BEAR的准确性达到100%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BEAR为BGP异常事件的自动化解释提供了新思路，对网络管理具有重要价值。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 解决WiFi 7中MLO技术在密集网络环境下动态信道分配的挑战。

Method: 利用MAB框架和BAI-MCTS算法，结合LLM提出LLM-BAI-MCTS算法。

Result: BAI-MCTS比现有算法快50.44%达到98%最优值，LLM-BAI-MCTS在密集网络中提速63.32%。

Conclusion: 所提算法显著提升了动态信道分配的效率和适应性。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Method: 研究分析了70多篇关于NWDAF的学术文献，识别其趋势和局限，并提出两种新用例来探索NWDAF的潜力。

Result: 研究发现现有研究局限于少数方法和用例，主要受数据集可用性限制。提出的新用例为NWDAF的广泛应用和商业化提供了方向。

Conclusion: 推广NWDAF的应用需要更多样化的研究和方法，尤其是探索其商业化潜力，以帮助MNOs在数字经济中竞争。

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Result: 实验表明，攻击者能够以高保真度重构用户的微调图像数据。

Conclusion: 研究强调了PEFT技术中隐私保护机制的必要性，并为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为验证机器学习系统副本的可信度提供了实用的方法和工具，有助于推动负责任AI的发展。

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

Result: 发现工具因测量不准确或缺乏实用性而未被采用，并识别出两类主要障碍。

Conclusion: 基于测量理论和实用测量方法，提出了改进建议，以更好地满足实践者需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

TL;DR: 论文质疑法院是否应给予如GPT-4和Gemini等大型生成AI模型的输出第一修正案保护，认为其缺乏意图性，不属于法律意义上的言论，因此无言论可保护，且此保护无助于言论自由的核心理念。

Motivation: 探讨AI模型输出是否应受第一修正案保护，分析其法律和社会的潜在影响。

Method: 通过法律分析和逻辑论证，评估AI输出是否满足言论的法律定义及其社会后果。

Result: 认为AI输出不构成言论，保护其会阻碍政府监管并增加社会风险。

Conclusion: 不应将第一修正案保护延伸至AI模型输出。

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: physics.comp-ph

Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络（PINNs）通常依赖全连接架构，难以捕捉复杂的空间层次结构和复杂边界条件，因此需要改进。

Method: BridgeNet利用自适应CNN层进行局部特征提取，并采用动态加权损失函数严格满足物理约束。

Result: 大量数值实验表明，BridgeNet在误差指标和收敛速度上优于传统PINN方法，且在高维环境下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该工作在计算物理领域取得了重要进展，为金融数学和复杂系统动力学等提供了可扩展且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to
complex system dynamics.

Result: 模型能从挑战性数据中学习生成语音，但在控制语音清晰度和说话者身份一致性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究提出了改进方向，以提升此类模型在语音重建任务中的控制能力。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

Result: 交错方法对齐效果最佳但推理慢；ESI模式显著加速解码且性能略优；高质量QA数据集提升了语音QA性能。

Conclusion: 早期停止交错模式（ESI）是一种高效且性能优越的联合语音文本解码策略。

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such

EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,

robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and

The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures

address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a

networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 新算法在启动成本和通信成本上表现优异，适用于单智能体和联邦RL。

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在合成和真实数据集上达到了最先进的预测性能。

Conclusion: 分布编码（DE）是一种有效且互补的方法，适用于离散和混合空间中的贝叶斯优化。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Abstract: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is
crucial in many domains, but obtaining data from such simultaneous
interventions can be challenging. Our study explores how to learn joint
interventional effects using only observational data and single-variable
interventions. We present an identifiability result for this problem, showing
that for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms, joint effects can be
inferred without access to joint interventional data. We propose a practical
estimator that decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded
contributions for each intervention variable. Experiments on synthetic data
demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to models trained
directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational
estimator.

Conclusion: 扩展的非线性加性噪声模型适用于向量间因果关系推断，为复杂领域提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

Conclusion: 研究展示了一种高效且通用的解决方案，能够通过单一的物理信息训练阶段解决多种最优控制问题，简化了传统方法的复杂性。

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

Result: 实验表明，Exp4Fuse在多个数据集上超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时达到了SOTA效果。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在提升稀疏检索的查询扩展性能方面表现出色，具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在可视化文档检索中表现优异但内存消耗大，需要优化。

Method: 评估了两种令牌减少策略：令牌修剪和令牌合并，最终选择合并策略并优化组合。

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2仅用11.8%内存保持98.2%性能，内存2.8%时保持94.6%效果。

Conclusion: 研究成果为高效可视化文档检索提供了重要见解和竞争基准。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

Main category: cs.IR

Motivation: 利用大型语言模型的语义理解能力解决推荐任务中用户反馈隐式、缺乏推理监督的问题。

Method: R2Rec采用渐进掩码提示策略，将用户-项目交互链转化为结构化推理步骤，结合监督微调和强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，R2Rec在HitRatio@1指标上平均提升10.48%，性能显著优于基线。

Conclusion: R2Rec通过显式推理链提升推荐性能和可解释性，为解决隐式反馈问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

Method: 使用Fokas方法模拟垂直渗透数据，并通过多种机器学习模型（如SVM和NN）进行回归任务。

Result: SVMs和NNs表现最稳健，预测精度高，尤其在扩散率D的预测上优于水力传导率K。

Conclusion: 支持向量机和神经网络在土壤特性预测中表现优异，尤其在不同数据条件下具有高鲁棒性。

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a
two-output regression task, we explore various machine learning models. The
performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the
highest robustness, achieving near-perfect accuracy and minimal errors.

Main category: math.ST

Motivation: 深度学习应用中全局Lipschitz连续性条件常不满足，因此研究超线性增长对数梯度的分布采样问题。

Method: 提出kTULA算法，基于Langevin动力学，并分析了其在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离中的收敛性。

Result: kTULA在KL散度中实现了2-ε̅的收敛速率，显著优于现有结果，并在高维双势阱分布和神经网络优化问题中验证了其性能。

Conclusion: kTULA在理论性能和实际应用中表现优异，为相关优化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.
