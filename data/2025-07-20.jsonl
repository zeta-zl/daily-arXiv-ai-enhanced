What permits us to draw in globally relevant\ninformation and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that\npeople use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to\nconstruct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a\ncomputational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture''\n(MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval\nand model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent\nworld models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel\nreasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of\nsports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning\nby requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language;\n(ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in\nlight of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA\napproach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines,\nunder both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports\nmodel synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way\nthat mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over\nglobally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating\nhuman reasoning in open-ended domains."}

Language Model Representations Reflect Human Judgments of Event Plausibility", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question\nanswering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM\nmodal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with\nthe potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans."}

DS methods, due to the ensemble being instance-based, seem to be an\nefficient choice under drifting scenarios. However, some attention must be paid\nto adapting such methods for concept drift. The training must be done in order\nto create local experts, and the commonly used neighborhood-search DS may\nbecome prohibitive with the continuous arrival of data.

In contrast, closed-loop user studies required adapting FL methods to\naccommodate single-user, real-time interactions, a scenario not supported by\nstandard FL. This modification resulted in local learning decoders surpassing\nthe adapted FL approach in closed-loop performance, yet local learning still\ncarried higher privacy risks.

NTKs typically actively change during\ntraining and are related to feature learning. In parallel, recent work on\nGradient Descent (GD) has found a phenomenon called Edge of Stability (EoS), in\nwhich the largest eigenvalue of the NTK oscillates around a value inversely\nproportional to the step size. However, although follow-up works have explored\nthe underlying mechanism of such eigenvalue behavior in depth, the\nunderstanding of the behavior of the NTK eigenvectors during EoS is still\nmissing. This paper examines the dynamics of NTK eigenvectors during EoS in\ndetail. Across different architectures, we observe that larger learning rates\ncause the leading eigenvectors of the final NTK, as well as the full NTK\nmatrix, to have greater alignment with the training target. We then study the\nunderlying mechanism of this phenomenon and provide a theoretical analysis for\na two-layer linear network. Our study enhances the understanding of GD training\ndynamics in deep learning."}

Existing DCT methods\nmainly measure discrepancies between a distribution pair defined on discrete\none-dimensional spaces (e.g., using total variation), which limits their\napplications to complex data (e.g., images). To extend DCT to more types of\ndata, a natural idea is to introduce maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a powerful\nmeasurement of the distributional discrepancy between two complex\ndistributions, into DCT scenarios. However, we find that MMD's value can be the\nsame for many pairs of distributions that have different norms in the same\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), making MMD less informative when\nassessing the closeness levels for multiple distribution pairs. To mitigate the\nissue, we design a new measurement of distributional discrepancy, norm-adaptive\nMMD (NAMMD), which scales MMD's value using the RKHS norms of distributions.\nBased on the asymptotic distribution of NAMMD, we finally propose the\nNAMMD-based DCT to assess the closeness levels of a distribution pair.\nTheoretically, we prove that NAMMD-based DCT has higher test power compared to\nMMD-based DCT, with bounded type-I error, which is also validated by extensive\nexperiments on many types of data (e.g., synthetic noise, real images).\nFurthermore, we also apply the proposed NAMMD for addressing the two-sample\ntesting problem and find NAMMD-based two-sample test has higher test power than\nthe MMD-based two-sample test in both theory and experiments."}

However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior.

Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference,\nit includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these\ndesigns, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs,\nwhile still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate\nour approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results\ndemonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out\nof 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared\nto its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves\nsimilar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%.\nCode and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL."}

An increasingly important\naspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how\nenergy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of\ninterest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena\nthat incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the\nevaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented,\nshowing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy\nconsumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests\nthat for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more\ncomplex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived\nquality of the responses that justifies their use."}

We\ndistinguish between architectural repetition - reusing structure - and\nparameter-shared module repetition, where the same functional unit is repeated\nacross a network. The latter exhibits key CI properties such as robustness,\nadaptability, and generalization. Evidence suggests that the repeated module\ntends to converge toward a generalist module: simple, flexible problem solvers\ncapable of handling many roles in the ensemble. This generalist tendency may\noffer solutions to longstanding challenges in modern AI: improved energy\nefficiency during training through simplicity and scalability, and robust\nembodied control via generalization. While empirical results suggest such\nsystems can generalize to out-of-distribution problems, theoretical results are\nstill lacking. Overall, architectures featuring module repetition remain an\nemerging and unexplored architectural strategy, with significant untapped\npotential for both efficiency, robustness, and adaptiveness. We believe that a\nsystem that adopts the benefits of CI, while adhering to architectural and\nfunctional principles of the minicolumns, could challenge the modern AI\nproblems of scalability, energy consumption, and democratization."}

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the\nexploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping\ncriteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information.

Graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave been proposed to address this, but they often oversimplify relational\nstructures by modeling all the tuples as monolithic nodes and ignoring\nintra-tuple associations. In this work, we propose a novel hypergraph-based\nframework, that we call rel-HNN, which models each unique attribute-value pair\nas a node and each tuple as a hyperedge, enabling the capture of fine-grained\nintra-tuple relationships. Our approach learns explicit multi-level\nrepresentations across attribute-value, tuple, and table levels. To address the\nscalability challenges posed by large RDBs, we further introduce a\nsplit-parallel training algorithm that leverages multi-GPU execution for\nefficient hypergraph learning. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that rel-HNN significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in both classification and regression tasks. Moreover, our\nsplit-parallel training achieves substantial speedups -- up to 3.18x for\nlearning on relational data and up to 2.94x for hypergraph learning -- compared\nto conventional single-GPU execution."}

In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a\nfeature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its\nsparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a\nsalient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore,\nwe complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric\nfeatures, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a\ntransformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable\nprecise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior\ndetector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater\nrobustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy\nand generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone\nDINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on\nthe TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while\nrunning efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single\nGPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor\ndriving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities."}

In this paper, we\npropose LaViPlan, a framework that leverages Reinforcement Learning with\nVerifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize VLMs using planning-oriented metrics.\nThis approach addresses the vision-language-action misalignment observed in\nexisting VLMs fine-tuned via supervised learning, which can recognize driving\nscenarios but often produce context-unaware decisions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method improves situational awareness and decision-making\nunder OOD conditions, highlighting its potential to mitigate the misalignment\nissue. This work introduces a promising post-training paradigm for VLM agents\nin the context of autonomous driving."}

In this paper, we propose a\nDMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise\nPower-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges.

A 3D nnU-Net model was trained on\nmanually segmented images selected from the baseline frames of 4D\ndiffusion-weighted MRI scans. The segmentation model demonstrated robust\nperformance, yielding a mean Dice coefficient of 82.14%. Next, voxel-wise model\nfitting was performed based on both the nnU-Net-predicted and manual lung\nsegmentations to quantify IVIM parameters reflecting tissue microstructure and\nperfusion. The results suggested no differences between the two. Our work shows\nthat a fully automated pipeline is possible for supporting fetal lung maturity\nassessment and clinical decision-making."}

Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still\nunderperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a\nmulti-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS\ntiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel\ndesigns: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction.\nGuided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement\nmodules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA)\nmodule employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny\nobjects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive\nfusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow\nand fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural\ndetail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our\nRS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and\n6.5% AP75.
