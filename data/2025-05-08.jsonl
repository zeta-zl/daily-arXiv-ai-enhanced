Existing\nstate-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses\ngenerated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these\napproaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is\nconsistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with\nrespect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in\naddition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal\nmodels. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The\nconfidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall\nconfidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the\npipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric\ncalibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the\naccuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across\nmultiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and\nvisual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as\nLLaVA-Med and LLaVA. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework\nachieves significantly improved calibration on both tasks."}

While current GNNs perform well in\nnode classification tasks within in-distribution (ID) settings, real-world\nscenarios often present distribution shifts, leading to the presence of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) nodes. OOD detection in graphs is a crucial and\nchallenging task. Most existing research focuses on homogeneous graphs, but\nreal-world graphs are often heterogeneous, consisting of diverse node and edge\ntypes. This heterogeneity adds complexity and enriches the informational\ncontent. To the best of our knowledge, OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs\nremains an underexplored area. In this context, we propose a novel methodology\nfor OOD detection in heterogeneous graphs (OODHG) that aims to achieve two main\nobjectives: 1) detecting OOD nodes and 2) classifying all ID nodes based on the\nfirst task's results. Specifically, we learn representations for each node in\nthe heterogeneous graph, calculate energy values to determine whether nodes are\nOOD, and then classify ID nodes. To leverage the structural information of\nheterogeneous graphs, we introduce a meta-path-based energy propagation\nmechanism and an energy constraint to enhance the distinction between ID and\nOOD nodes. Extensive experimental findings substantiate the simplicity and\neffectiveness of OODHG, demonstrating its superiority over baseline models in\nOOD detection tasks and its accuracy in ID node classification."}

Therefore, it remains unclear\nhow to effectively extend reasoning capabilities beyond text input and general\ndomains. This paper explores a fundamental research question: Is reasoning\ngeneralizable across modalities and domains? Our findings support an\naffirmative answer: General-domain text-based post-training can enable such\nstrong generalizable reasoning. Leveraging this finding, we introduce\nX-Reasoner, a vision-language model post-trained solely on general-domain text\nfor generalizable reasoning, using a two-stage approach: an initial supervised\nfine-tuning phase with distilled long chain-of-thoughts, followed by\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Experiments show that\nX-Reasoner successfully transfers reasoning capabilities to both multimodal and\nout-of-domain settings, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models trained\nwith in-domain and multimodal data across various general and medical\nbenchmarks (Figure 1). Additionally, we find that X-Reasoner's performance in\nspecialized domains can be further enhanced through continued training on\ndomain-specific text-only data.

This is done by introducing a novel Proximity\nAttention mechanism in an encoder-decoder architecture utilizing a Pointer\nNetwork in the decoding process (Proximity Attention Encoder and Pointer\nNetwork decoder: PAPN) to leverage the underlying connections between the\ndifferent visitable pickup positions at each timestep.

The obtained global context is then mixed to an aggregated\nversion of the local embedding thus achieving a mix of global and local\nattention for complete modeling of the problems. Proximity attention is also\nused in the decoding process to skew predictions towards the locations with the\nhighest attention scores and thus using inter-connectivity of locations as a\nbase for next-location prediction. This method is trained, validated and tested\non a large industry-level dataset of real-world, large-scale last-mile delivery\nand first-mile pickup named LaDE[1].

Second, we\nconstruct a Legal Question Bank (LQB), which is a collection of legal questions\nwhose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive\nCLIC Recommender (CRec). Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation\nthat requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists\nquestions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given\nlegal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant\nlegal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects\nof creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such\nas GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated\nquestions (MGQs) against human-composed questions (HCQs) and find that MGQs are\nmore scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more\nprecise. We also show a prototype of CRec and illustrate through an example how\nour 3-step approach effectively brings relevant legal knowledge to the public."}

However, traditional\nhuman-led evaluations struggle with high call volumes, leading to low coverage\nand delayed assessments. We introduce LogiDebrief, an AI-driven framework that\nautomates traditional 9-1-1 call debriefing by integrating Signal-Temporal\nLogic (STL) with Large Language Models (LLMs) for fully-covered rigorous\nperformance evaluation. LogiDebrief formalizes call-taking requirements as\nlogical specifications, enabling systematic assessment of 9-1-1 calls against\nprocedural guidelines.

The task is turn-based,\nmulti-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its\nlong-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated\ndynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play\n(HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates\ncentralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level\nmotion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to\nenable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert\ndemonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level\nstrategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint\nfine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior\nperformance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based\nhierarchical baselines with an average 82.9\\% win rate and a 71.5\\% win rate\nagainst the two-stage variant.

Drawing on a\nsupply-and-demand model and the concept of distributed agency, the framework\noutlines how hallucinations differ from human-generated misinformation in\nproduction, perception, and institutional response. I conclude by outlining a\nresearch agenda for communication scholars to investigate the emergence,\ndissemination, and audience reception of hallucinated content, with attention\nto macro (institutional), meso (group), and micro (individual) levels. This\nwork urges communication researchers to rethink the boundaries of\nmisinformation theory in light of probabilistic, non-human actors increasingly\nembedded in knowledge production."}

(2) Prohibitively High API Costs: RL training requires\nfrequent rollouts, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of search\nrequests, which incur substantial API expenses and severely constrain\nscalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ZeroSearch, a\nreinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the search capabilities of\nLLMs without interacting with real search engines.

This study explores\nwhether such narratives can similarly nudge LLM agents toward collaboration. We\nuse a finitely repeated public goods game in which LLM agents choose either\ncooperative or egoistic spending strategies. We prime agents with stories\nhighlighting teamwork to different degrees and test how this influences\nnegotiation outcomes. Our experiments explore four questions:(1) How do\nnarratives influence negotiation behavior? (2) What differs when agents share\nthe same story versus different ones? (3) What happens when the agent numbers\ngrow? (4) Are agents resilient against self-serving negotiators? We find that\nstory-based priming significantly affects negotiation strategies and success\nrates. Common stories improve collaboration, benefiting each agent. By\ncontrast, priming agents with different stories reverses this effect, and those\nagents primed toward self-interest prevail. We hypothesize that these results\ncarry implications for multi-agent system design and AI alignment."}

Existing\nstate-of-the-art UQ methods rely on consistency among multiple responses\ngenerated by the LLM on an input query under diverse settings. However, these\napproaches often report higher confidence in scenarios where the LLM is\nconsistently incorrect. This leads to a poorly calibrated confidence with\nrespect to accuracy. To address this, we leverage cross-modal consistency in\naddition to self-consistency to improve the calibration of the multi-modal\nmodels. Specifically, we ground the textual responses to the visual inputs. The\nconfidence from the grounding model is used to calibrate the overall\nconfidence. Given that using a grounding model adds its own uncertainty in the\npipeline, we apply temperature scaling - a widely accepted parametric\ncalibration technique - to calibrate the grounding model's confidence in the\naccuracy of generated responses. We evaluate the proposed approach across\nmultiple multi-modal tasks, such as medical question answering (Slake) and\nvisual question answering (VQAv2), considering multi-modal models such as\nLLaVA-Med and LLaVA.

To this effect,\nScarceGAN re-formulates semi-supervised GAN by accommodating weakly labelled\nmulti-class negative samples and the available positive samples.

The first\nchallenge relates to the interaction and cooperation between low-rank and\nsparse matrices, while the second involves determining weight allocation across\ndifferent layers, as redundancy varies considerably among them. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel two-stage LLM compression method with the\ncapability of global rank and sparsity optimization. It is noteworthy that the\noverall optimization space is vast, making comprehensive optimization\ncomputationally prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the optimization space, our\nfirst stage utilizes robust principal component analysis to decompose the\nweight matrices of LLMs into low-rank and sparse components, which span the low\ndimensional and sparse spaces containing the resultant low-rank and sparse\nmatrices, respectively. In the second stage, we propose a probabilistic global\noptimization technique to jointly identify the low-rank and sparse structures\nwithin the above two spaces.

Adversary\nmodeling is an important capability in cybersecurity that lets defenders\ncharacterize behaviors of potential attackers, which enables attribution to\nknown cyber adversary groups. Existing approaches rely on documenting an\never-evolving set of attacker tools and techniques to track known threat\nactors. Although attacks evolve constantly, attacker behavioral preferences are\nintrinsic and less volatile. Our approach learns the behavioral preferences of\ncyber adversaries from forensics data on their tools and techniques. We model\nthe attacker as an expert decision-making agent with unknown behavioral\npreferences situated in a computer host. We leverage attack provenance graphs\nof audit logs to derive a state-action trajectory of the attack. We test our\napproach on open datasets of audit logs containing real attack data. Our\nresults demonstrate for the first time that low-level forensics data can\nautomatically reveal an adversary's subjective preferences, which serves as an\nadditional dimension to modeling and documenting cyber adversaries. Attackers'\npreferences tend to be invariant despite their different tools and indicate\npredispositions that are inherent to the attacker. As such, these inferred\npreferences can potentially serve as unique behavioral signatures of attackers\nand improve threat attribution."}

To achieve this, FLAIR\nintegrates two key modules: a Task Featurization Module for encoding\ntask-specific features into standardized representations, and a Dynamic\nDecision Engine, pre-trained via Bayesian meta-training, to adapt seamlessly\nusing contextual information at runtime. Extensive experiments across key\ndatabase tasks demonstrate that FLAIR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,\nachieving up to 5.2x faster adaptation and reducing error by 22.5% for\ncardinality estimation."}

The conventional\napproach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging\nand expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological\ninformation of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with\nautomated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a\nquantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully\nlabeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a\nweakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However,\ncurrent LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature\nextractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing\nrecovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the\nloss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale\nLearning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion\nloss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor\nby using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our\nmodel with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in\nclassification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages."}

For practical applications, we propose specific WCTM algorithms\nthat accommodate online adaptation to mild covariate shifts (in the marginal\ninput distribution) while raising alarms in response to more severe shifts,\nsuch as concept shifts (in the conditional label distribution) or extreme\n(out-of-support) covariate shifts that cannot be easily adapted to. On\nreal-world datasets, we demonstrate improved performance relative to\nstate-of-the-art baselines."}

The corresponding Gaussians are defined via\nthe notion of kernel mean and covariance embedding of a probability measure.\nDiscerning two singular Gaussians is fundamentally simpler from an\ninformation-theoretic perspective than non-parametric two-sample testing,\nparticularly in high-dimensional settings. Our proof leverages the\nFeldman-Hajek criterion for singularity/equivalence of Gaussians on Hilbert\nspaces, and shows that discrepancies between distributions are heavily\nmagnified through their corresponding Gaussian embeddings: at a population\nlevel, distinct probability measures lead to essentially separated Gaussian\nembeddings. This appears to be a new instance of the blessing of dimensionality\nthat can be harnessed for the design of efficient inference tools in great\ngenerality."}

We introduce\nEchoInk-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances such reasoning in\nMLLMs. Built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni-7B foundation and optimized with Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EchoInk-R1 tackles multiple-choice\nquestion answering over synchronized audio-image pairs. To enable this, we\ncurate AVQA-R1-6K, a dataset pairing such audio-image inputs with\nmultiple-choice questions derived from OmniInstruct-v1. EchoInk-R1-7B achieves\n85.77% accuracy on the validation set, outperforming the base model, which\nscores 80.53%, using only 562 reinforcement learning steps. Beyond accuracy,\nEchoInk-R1 demonstrates reflective reasoning by revisiting initial\ninterpretations and refining responses when facing ambiguous multimodal inputs.\nThese results suggest that lightweight reinforcement learning fine-tuning\nenhances cross-modal reasoning in MLLMs. EchoInk-R1 is the first framework to\nunify audio, visual, and textual modalities for general open-world reasoning\nvia reinforcement learning. Code and data are publicly released to facilitate\nfurther research."}
