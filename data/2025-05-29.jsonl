Assessing Amplified Hallucination in Multimodal Reasoning Models", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CV"], "comment": null, "summary": "Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate\nextended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as\nmultimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes\nwith increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to\ndrift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language\npriors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced\nfocus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically\nstudy this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a\nmodel's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to\nevaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also\nrelease RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal\ntasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and\nhallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a\nbetter balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is\ninfluenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall\nvolume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that\njointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity."}

To reduce\nthe computation of repeated historical tokens, cross-request key-value (KV)\ncache reuse, a technique that stores and reuses intermediate computations, has\nbecome a crucial method in multi-round interactive services. However, in\ninfilling tasks, the KV cache reuse is often hindered by the structure of the\nprompt format, which typically consists of a prefix and suffix relative to the\ninsertion point. Specifically, the KV cache of the prefix or suffix part is\nfrequently invalidated as the other part (suffix or prefix) is incrementally\ngenerated. To address the issue, we propose EFIM, a transformed prompt format\nof FIM to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse. Although the\ntransformed prompt can solve the inefficiency, it exposes subtoken generation\nproblems in current LLMs, where they have difficulty generating partial words\naccurately. Therefore, we introduce a fragment tokenization training method\nwhich splits text into multiple fragments before tokenization during data\nprocessing. Experiments on two representative LLMs show that LLM serving with\nEFIM can lower the latency by 52% and improve the throughput by 98% while\nmaintaining the original infilling capability.EFIM's source code is publicly\navailable at https://github.com/gty111/EFIM."}

BOSP is generally computationally\nchallenging as the size of the search space is exponential in the number of\nobjective functions and the graph size.

We find that LLMs are\nstrong at interpreting the high-level body movements but struggle with precise\nbody part positioning. While breaking down motion queries into atomic\ncomponents improves planning performance, LLMs have difficulty with multi-step\nmovements involving high-degree-of-freedom body parts. Furthermore, LLMs\nprovide reasonable approximation for general spatial descriptions, but fail to\nhandle precise spatial specifications in text, and the precise spatial-temporal\nparameters needed for avatar control.

By\naddressing the lack of benchmarks for multi-hop reasoning in biomedical domain,\nBioHopR sets a new standard for evaluating reasoning capabilities and\nhighlights critical gaps between proprietary and open-source models while\npaving the way for future advancements in biomedical LLMs."}

To address these challenges, we propose building defences\nutilising multiple inputs and data fusion to create defensive components and an\nAI security metric as a novel approach toward developing more secure AI\nsystems. We name this approach the Data Fusion Cyber Resilience (DFCR) method,\nand we evaluate it through real-world demonstrations and comprehensive\nquantitative analyses, comparing a system built with the DFCR method against\nsingle-input models and models utilising existing state-of-the-art defences.\nThe findings show that the DFCR approach significantly enhances resilience\nagainst adversarial machine learning attacks in maritime autonomous system\noperations, achieving up to a 35\\% reduction in loss for successful\nmulti-pronged perturbation attacks, up to a 100\\% reduction in loss for\nsuccessful adversarial patch attacks and up to 100\\% reduction in loss for\nsuccessful spoofing attacks when using these more resilient systems.

To investigate potential LLM performance disparities,\nwe design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term\nchoice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to\ndifferently in Mainland China and Taiwan), and regional name choice (prompting\nthe LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and\nTraditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of 11 leading\ncommercial LLM services and open-sourced models -- spanning those primarily\ntrained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our analyses\nindicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and\nprompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified\nChinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored\nTraditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these\ndisparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written\ncharacter preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese.\nThese findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such,\nwe provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations\nof future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants\n(https://github.com/brucelyu17/SC-TC-Bench)."}

We quantify memorization for each real sample based on how\nmany generated samples are flagged as replicas, using a relative distance\nratio. Our empirical analysis reveals a heavy-tailed distribution of\nmemorization counts: a small subset of samples contributes disproportionately\nto leakage, confirmed via sample-removal experiments. To understand this, we\ndivide real samples into top- and non-top-memorized groups and analyze their\ntraining-time behaviors. We track when each sample is first memorized and\nmonitor per-epoch memorization intensity (AUC). Memorized samples are memorized\nslightly earlier and show stronger signals in early training.

This\npaper situates Indo-Aryan languages within the typology of cross-linguistic\nnumeral systems, and explores the linguistic and non-linguistic factors that\nmay be responsible for the persistence of complex systems in these languages.\nUsing cross-linguistic data from multiple databases, we develop and employ a\nnumber of cross-linguistically applicable metrics to quantifies the complexity\nof languages' numeral systems, and demonstrate that Indo-Aryan languages have\ndecisively more complex numeral systems than the world's languages as a whole,\nthough individual Indo-Aryan languages differ from each other in terms of the\ncomplexity of the patterns they display. We investigate the factors (e.g.,\nreligion, geographic isolation, etc.) that underlie complexity in numeral\nsystems, with a focus on South Asia, in an attempt to develop an account of why\ncomplex numeral systems developed and persisted in certain Indo-Aryan languages\nbut not elsewhere. Finally, we demonstrate that Indo-Aryan numeral systems\nadhere to certain general pressures toward efficient communication found\ncross-linguistically, despite their high complexity. We call for this somewhat\noverlooked dimension of complexity to be taken seriously when discussing\ngeneral variation in cross-linguistic numeral systems."}

We explore how these architectural\nconstraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of\n$\\textit{retrieval}$ and $\\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al.\n[2024]. We use the recently proposed C-RASP framework for studying length\ngeneralization [Huang et al., 2025b] to provide guarantees for each of our\nsettings. Empirically, we observe an $\\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$\nasymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right\n(induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This\nasymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is\nguaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is\nconnected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction\ncircuits within pretrained Transformers. We validate our findings through\npractical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks.

However, empirically\noptimal learning rates consistently decay much slower than theoretically\npredicted. By carefully studying neural network training dynamics, we\ndemonstrate that this discrepancy is not fully explained by finite-width\nphenomena such as catapult effects or a lack of alignment between weights and\nincoming activations.

Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are\nefficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets\nof different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to\ndesign an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to\nuse an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per\ntask. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions $n$ datasets into $m$\ngroups, where $m$ is typically much smaller than $n$ in practice, and train one\nadapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the\nensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of\nlow-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset\ncombinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we\nuse the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during\nfine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than $1\\%$ error\non models with up to $34$ billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true\nfine-tuning performances under $5\\%$ error while speeding up computation\ncompared to base fine-tuning by $105$ times.

In this work\nwe give a formal PAC-learning framework for studying this problem. We propose\nand analyze several natural verification goals, at different levels of\nstrength, in this framework. We provide sample complexity upper-bounds for\nlearning verifiers satisfying these goals, as well as lower-bound and\nimpossibility results for learning other natural verification objectives\nwithout additional assumptions."}

In this work, we explore FAR, a Function-preserving Attention\nReplacement framework that replaces all attention blocks in pretrained\ntransformers with learnable sequence-to-sequence modules, exemplified by an\nLSTM. FAR optimize a multi-head LSTM architecture with a block-wise\ndistillation objective and a global structural pruning framework to achieve a\nfamily of efficient LSTM-based models from pretrained transformers. We validate\nFAR on the DeiT vision transformer family and demonstrate that it matches the\naccuracy of the original models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with\nreduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the\nsemantic token relationships and the token-to-token correlation learned in the\ntransformer's attention module."}

Traditional text-based methods cannot\nhandle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG\napproaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to\nreason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental\ncapabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model\nreasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex\nreasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact\nwith search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning\ntrajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual\noptimization based on these samples.

However,\nReLU units are prone to becoming irreversibly inactive - a phenomenon known as\nthe dying ReLU problem - which limits their overall effectiveness. In this\nwork, we introduce surrogate gradient learning for ReLU (SUGAR) as a novel,\nplug-and-play regularizer for deep architectures. SUGAR preserves the standard\nReLU function during the forward pass but replaces its derivative in the\nbackward pass with a smooth surrogate that avoids zeroing out gradients. We\ndemonstrate that SUGAR, when paired with a well-chosen surrogate function,\nsubstantially enhances generalization performance over convolutional network\narchitectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-18, providing sparser activations while\neffectively resurrecting dead ReLUs. Moreover, we show that even in modern\narchitectures like Conv2NeXt and Swin Transformer - which typically employ GELU\n- substituting these with SUGAR yields competitive and even slightly superior\nperformance.

Focusing on\nlinear programs, we characterize when a dataset is sufficient to recover an\noptimal decision, given an uncertainty set on the cost vector. Our main\ncontribution is a sharp geometric characterization that identifies the\ndirections of the cost vector that matter for optimality, relative to the task\nconstraints and uncertainty set. We further develop a practical algorithm that,\nfor a given task, constructs a minimal or least-costly sufficient dataset. Our\nresults reveal that small, well-chosen datasets can often fully determine\noptimal decisions -- offering a principled foundation for task-aware data\nselection."}

In this paper, we\naim to mitigate overthinking by investigating the underlying mechanisms from\nthe perspective of mechanistic interpretability. We first showcase that the\ntendency of overthinking can be effectively captured by a single direction in\nthe model's activation space and the issue can be eased by intervening the\nactivations along this direction.

Each stage would trigger new research opportunities in\nareas such as language models, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and\ngenerative modeling; together, they could unleash the full potential of MASs in\ncomplicated real-world applications. Then, we discuss the potential challenges\nand opportunities in the evaluation of multiple systems. We hope our\nperspective and framework can offer critical new insights in the era of agentic\nAI."}

Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations,\ncausing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example,\nundetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake.\nICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed\nto attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive\nmechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS\nphysical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating\nthe noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors\nproduce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.\n  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity\nof ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy\nphysical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by\nestimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random\nForest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or\nare limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of\nmeasurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of\ncomplex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a\ncase study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare\nthe performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative\nnoise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of\nup to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best\ndistribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution\nprovided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot\nfidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available."}

This recommendation unlearning challenge\npresents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs\ncreates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting\nrecommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from\nsignificant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and\ndiminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that\nmay not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random\narchitectures.

Based on our findings,\nwe introduce Sherlock, a self-correction and self-improvement training\nframework. Sherlock introduces a trajectory-level self-correction objective, a\npreference data construction method based on visual perturbation, and a dynamic\n$\\beta$ for preference tuning. Once the model acquires self-correction\ncapabilities using only 20k randomly sampled annotated data, it continues to\nself-improve without external supervision. Built on the Llama3.2-Vision-11B\nmodel, Sherlock achieves remarkable results across eight benchmarks, reaching\nan average accuracy of 64.1 with direct generation and 65.4 after\nself-correction.

Recent\napproaches attempt to address this challenge by manually deciding when to apply\nlong or short reasoning. However, they lack the flexibility to adapt CoT length\ndynamically based on question complexity. In this paper, we propose Auto\nLong-Short Reasoning (AutoL2S), a dynamic and model-agnostic framework that\nenables LLMs to dynamically compress their generated reasoning path based on\nthe complexity of the reasoning question. AutoL2S enables a learned paradigm,\nin which LLMs themselves can decide when longer reasoning is necessary and when\nshorter reasoning suffices, by training on data annotated with our proposed\nmethod, which includes both long and short CoT paths and a special <EASY>\ntoken. We then use <EASY> token to indicate when the model can skip generating\nlengthy CoT reasoning. This proposed annotation strategy can enhance the LLMs'\nability to generate shorter CoT reasoning paths with improved quality after\ntraining. Extensive evaluation results show that AutoL2S reduces the length of\nreasoning generation by up to 57% without compromising performance,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of AutoL2S for scalable and efficient LLM\nreasoning."}
