TL;DR: 研究评估了六种大型语言模型（LLMs）在自杀风险评估任务中的表现，发现Claude和GPT与人类标注最为接近，而Mistral的预测误差最低，同时强调了人类监督和伦理问题的重要性。

Motivation: 自杀预防是公共健康的重要挑战，随着LLMs的普及，人们可能更倾向于向AI系统表达自杀倾向，而非人类。本研究旨在评估LLMs在自杀风险评估中的能力。

Method: 研究使用哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评分量表（C-SSRS）对六种模型（包括Claude、GPT、Mistral和LLaMA）的零样本表现进行评估，分类帖子到一个7级严重程度量表。

Result: 结果表明，Claude和GPT与人类标注最为接近，Mistral的预测误差最低，且大多数模型表现出了对不同严重程度的敏感性，误分类通常发生在相邻级别。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在自杀风险评估中表现出潜力，但仍需人类监督、透明度和谨慎部署，以确保其伦理性和可靠性。

Abstract: Suicide prevention remains a critical public health challenge. While online
platforms such as Reddit's r/SuicideWatch have historically provided spaces for
individuals to express suicidal thoughts and seek community support, the advent
of large language models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm-where individuals may
begin disclosing ideation to AI systems instead of humans. This study evaluates
the capability of LLMs to perform automated suicide risk assessment using the
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). We assess the zero-shot
performance of six models-including Claude, GPT, Mistral, and LLaMA-in
classifying posts across a 7-point severity scale (Levels 0-6). Results
indicate that Claude and GPT closely align with human annotations, while
Mistral achieves the lowest ordinal prediction error. Most models exhibit
ordinal sensitivity, with misclassifications typically occurring between
adjacent severity levels. We further analyze confusion patterns,
misclassification sources, and ethical considerations, underscoring the
importance of human oversight, transparency, and cautious deployment. Full code

TL;DR: 本文介绍了中文多模态隐喻广告数据集EmoMeta，填补了多模态隐喻情感数据集的空白，支持细粒度情感分类。

Motivation: 多模态隐喻在情感表达中作用显著，但相关中文数据集稀缺，且现有研究多聚焦英语。本文旨在解决这一研究缺口。

Method: 构建包含5,000条文本-图像对的中文多模态隐喻广告数据集，标注隐喻、领域关系和九种细粒度情感。

Result: 数据集公开可用，支持多模态隐喻情感分类研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集推动了多模态隐喻情感分析领域的发展，并考虑了语言差异。

Abstract: Metaphors play a pivotal role in expressing emotions, making them crucial for
emotional intelligence. The advent of multimodal data and widespread
communication has led to a proliferation of multimodal metaphors, amplifying
the complexity of emotion classification compared to single-mode scenarios.
However, the scarcity of research on constructing multimodal metaphorical
fine-grained emotion datasets hampers progress in this domain. Moreover,
existing studies predominantly focus on English, overlooking potential
variations in emotional nuances across languages. To address these gaps, we
introduce a multimodal dataset in Chinese comprising 5,000 text-image pairs of
metaphorical advertisements. Each entry is meticulously annotated for metaphor
occurrence, domain relations and fine-grained emotion classification
encompassing joy, love, trust, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, surprise,
anticipation, and neutral. Our dataset is publicly accessible
(https://github.com/DUTIR-YSQ/EmoMeta), facilitating further advancements in
this burgeoning field.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）中存在的奖励模型偏见，提出了一种检测和评估前缀偏见的方法，并在多种开源数据集和模型架构中验证了偏见的普遍性，同时提出了一种数据增强策略以减轻偏见。

Motivation: 研究的动机是探索语言模型奖励模型中可能存在的偏见，特别是前缀偏见（由查询前缀微小变化引发的系统性偏好偏移），以及这种偏见在种族和性别维度上的表现。

Method: 论文提出了检测和评估前缀偏见的新方法，并在多样化开源偏好数据集和奖励模型架构中进行了全面评估。此外，论文还提出了一种数据增强策略用于减轻偏见。

Result: 研究发现所有测试的奖励模型均存在前缀偏见，尤其在种族和性别维度上表现显著。提出的数据增强策略显示了在降低偏见影响方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 论文强调了在开发公平可靠奖励模型时，需要对数据集设计和评估保持偏见意识，为AI公平性研究做出了贡献。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本评估中的一致性和偏见问题，发现模型间的共识在来源标注后显著下降，尤其是对中国来源的文本。

Motivation: 探究LLMs在文本评估中的一致性、偏见以及对来源标注的敏感性。

Method: 使用四种先进的LLM对4,800条叙事性陈述进行192,000次评估，并操纵陈述来源（来自LLM或特定国籍的人类）。

Result: 未标注来源时模型间高度一致；标注来源后共识下降，尤其是对中国来源的文本。

Conclusion: 来源标注对评估结果有显著影响，需关注LLM评估系统的完整性和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used not only to generate text
but also to evaluate it, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments
are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. In this study, we
systematically examine inter- and intra-model agreement across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (OpenAI o3-mini, Deepseek Reasoner, xAI Grok 2, and
Mistral) tasked with evaluating 4,800 narrative statements on 24 different
topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of
192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to
assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified
nationality affects evaluation outcomes. We find that, in the blind condition,
different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intra-model
agreement across topics. However, this alignment breaks down when source
framing is introduced. Here we show that attributing statements to Chinese
individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models, and in
particular for Deepseek Reasoner. Our findings reveal that framing effects can
deeply affect text evaluation, with significant implications for the integrity,
neutrality, and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成预训练Transformer（GPT3）的框架，用于更好地理解和总结电商产品的海量评论，帮助消费者快速做出决策。

Motivation: 由于消费者在电商平台上面对数千条评论时容易陷入决策瘫痪，现有商业工具仅通过评分机制提供调整后的分数，无法有效解决问题。论文旨在通过生成模型提供更智能的评论分析。

Method: 使用Curie引擎的GPT3模型（超过130亿参数）进行微调，引入抽象摘要而非简单的提取式摘要，结合“常识”分析评论。

Result: 模型能够生成评论的优缺点总结，揭示评论间的真实关系，帮助消费者快速了解产品并做出决策。

Conclusion: 生成模型能够有效解决海量评论带来的决策问题，提供更直观且具有“常识”的总结，提升消费者决策效率。

Abstract: Following the pandemic, customers, preference for using e-commerce has
accelerated. Since much information is available in multiple reviews (sometimes
running in thousands) for a single product, it can create decision paralysis
for the buyer. This scenario disempowers the consumer, who cannot be expected
to go over so many reviews since its time consuming and can confuse them.
Various commercial tools are available, that use a scoring mechanism to arrive
at an adjusted score. It can alert the user to potential review manipulations.
This paper proposes a framework that fine-tunes a generative pre-trained
transformer to understand these reviews better. Furthermore, using
"common-sense" to make better decisions. These models have more than 13 billion
parameters. To fine-tune the model for our requirement, we use the curie engine
from generative pre-trained transformer (GPT3). By using generative models, we
are introducing abstractive summarization. Instead of using a simple extractive
method of summarizing the reviews. This brings out the true relationship
between the reviews and not simply copy-paste. This introduces an element of
"common sense" for the user and helps them to quickly make the right decisions.
The user is provided the pros and cons of the processed reviews. Thus the
user/customer can take their own decisions.

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM4CD方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的开放世界知识增强认知诊断，通过语义表征替代传统ID嵌入，解决冷启动问题并提升性能。

Motivation: 传统认知诊断方法仅基于ID关系建模，忽视语义信息，且难以处理新学生和练习的冷启动问题，LLMs提供了解决这些问题的潜力。

Method: LLM4CD利用LLMs构建认知表达文本表征，并通过双层编码器框架（宏观认知文本编码器和微观知识状态编码器）建模学生测试历史。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM4CD在多个真实数据集上优于现有认知诊断模型。

Conclusion: 利用LLMs引入丰富语义信息能有效增强认知诊断任务，解决冷启动问题。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) plays a crucial role in intelligent education,
evaluating students' comprehension of knowledge concepts based on their test
histories. However, current CD methods often model students, exercises, and
knowledge concepts solely on their ID relationships, neglecting the abundant
semantic relationships present within educational data space. Furthermore,
contemporary intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) frequently involve the addition
of new students and exercises, a situation that ID-based methods find
challenging to manage effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs)
offers the potential for overcoming this challenge with open-world knowledge.
In this paper, we propose LLM4CD, which Leverages Large Language Models for
Open-World Knowledge Augmented Cognitive Diagnosis. Our method utilizes the
open-world knowledge of LLMs to construct cognitively expressive textual
representations, which are then encoded to introduce rich semantic information
into the CD task. Additionally, we propose an innovative bi-level encoder
framework that models students' test histories through two levels of encoders:
a macro-level cognitive text encoder and a micro-level knowledge state encoder.
This approach substitutes traditional ID embeddings with semantic
representations, enabling the model to accommodate new students and exercises
with open-world knowledge and address the cold-start problem. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently
outperforms previous CD models on multiple real-world datasets, validating the
effectiveness of leveraging LLMs to introduce rich semantic information into
the CD task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍了IRLBench，一个用于评估多语言模型性能的新基准，重点关注低资源语言（如爱尔兰语），并支持长文本生成和语言保真度评估。

Motivation: 解决现有基准在文化偏见、文本限制和低资源语言评估方面的不足。

Method: 开发IRLBench基准，基于2024年爱尔兰毕业考试，支持长文本生成和官方评分标准。

Result: 实验显示模型在英语和爱尔兰语之间存在性能差距，爱尔兰语生成正确率低于80%，准确率为55.8%。

Conclusion: 提出了一个更全面的评估工具，促进多语言AI的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their performance in multilingual and
low-resource settings remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often exhibit
cultural bias, restrict evaluation to text-only, rely on multiple-choice
formats, and, more importantly, are limited for extremely low-resource
languages. To address these gaps, we introduce IRLBench, presented in parallel
English and Irish, which is considered definitely endangered by UNESCO. Our
benchmark consists of 12 representative subjects developed from the 2024 Irish
Leaving Certificate exams, enabling fine-grained analysis of model capabilities
across domains. By framing the task as long-form generation and leveraging the
official marking scheme, it does not only support a comprehensive evaluation of
correctness but also language fidelity. Our extensive experiments of leading
closed-source and open-source LLMs reveal a persistent performance gap between
English and Irish, in which models produce valid Irish responses less than 80\%
of the time, and answer correctly 55.8\% of the time compared to 76.2\% in
English for the best-performing model. We release IRLBench
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/ReliableAI/IRLBench) and an accompanying
evaluation codebase (https://github.com/ReML-AI/IRLBench) to enable future
research on robust, culturally aware multilingual AI development.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中安全防护措施在噪声扰动下的鲁棒性，发现高斯噪声会显著增加有害输出率，且现有安全微调技术存在脆弱性。

Motivation: 安全防护措施对防止LLM有害输出至关重要，但其在扰动下的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过向模型激活层注入高斯噪声，系统评估了多种开源模型的安全微调鲁棒性。

Result: 高斯噪声使有害输出率上升高达27%，且深层安全微调无法提供额外保护，但思维链推理仍能保持。

Conclusion: 现有安全对齐技术存在漏洞，推理和强化学习可能是提升AI安全系统鲁棒性的方向。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in
preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains
poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety
fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model
activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise
raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety
fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought
reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities
in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of
reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction
for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important
implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications
as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even
without adversarial prompts.

TL;DR: EcoSafeRAG是一种无需依赖大型语言模型内部知识的检索增强生成（RAG）防御方法，通过语句级处理和诱饵引导的上下文多样性检测来识别恶意内容，同时提高安全性和性能。

Motivation: 现有的防御方法依赖模型内部知识，这与RAG的设计理念冲突，因此需要一种不依赖模型内部知识的防御机制。

Method: EcoSafeRAG采用语句级处理和诱饵引导的上下文多样性检测技术，通过分析候选文档的上下文多样性识别恶意内容。

Result: 实验表明，EcoSafeRAG在保持实际运行成本的同时，提供了最先进的安全性，并提高了干净场景下的性能。

Conclusion: EcoSafeRAG是一种高效的防御方法，解决了RAG的安全问题，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) compensates for the static knowledge
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge,
producing responses with enhanced factual correctness and query-specific
contextualization. However, it also introduces new attack surfaces such as
corpus poisoning at the same time. Most of the existing defense methods rely on
the internal knowledge of the model, which conflicts with the design concept of
RAG. To bridge the gap, EcoSafeRAG uses sentence-level processing and
bait-guided context diversity detection to identify malicious content by
analyzing the context diversity of candidate documents without relying on LLM
internal knowledge. Experiments show EcoSafeRAG delivers state-of-the-art
security with plug-and-play deployment, simultaneously improving clean-scenario
RAG performance while maintaining practical operational costs (relatively
1.2$\times$ latency, 48\%-80\% token reduction versus Vanilla RAG).

TL;DR: Time-R1是一种赋予中等规模LLM全面时间能力的框架，通过三阶段强化学习课程提升时间理解、预测和创造性生成能力，性能超越更大的模型。

Motivation: 解决现有LLM在时间智能方面的不足，如无法整合过去推理与未来预测，以及现有方法在时间技能上的孤立与泛化能力差。

Method: 采用三阶段强化学习课程，包括基础时间理解、未来事件预测和创造性场景生成，结合动态规则奖励系统。

Result: Time-R1在具有挑战性的未来事件预测和创造性场景生成基准测试中，优于大200倍的模型。

Conclusion: 精心设计的渐进式强化学习微调可使小型高效模型在时间性能上超越大型模型，为时间感知AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack
robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past
with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing
methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering
about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization,
particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or
requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter)
LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and
creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development
path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL)
curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system.
This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and
logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction
skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables
remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any
fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms
models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1,
on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation
benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered,
progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior
temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly
time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench},
a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of
news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

TL;DR: 研究揭示了诱导头在大型语言模型（LLMs）重复行为中的关键作用，并提出了一种通过注意力头正则化减少其主导性的方法。

Motivation: 理解LLMs生成重复序列（即“重复诅咒”）的机制，尤其是诱导头的作用，以改善模型输出多样性和连贯性。

Method: 研究诱导头的“毒性”（即其主导输出对数倾向），并开发注意力头正则化技术。

Result: 诱导头被发现是重复行为的主要驱动因素，提出技术可减少其主导性。

Conclusion: 诱导头导致重复诅咒的机制解释及潜在缓解方法为LLMs设计和训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Repetition curse is a phenomenon where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate
repetitive sequences of tokens or cyclic sequences. While the repetition curse
has been widely observed, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
In this work, we investigate the role of induction heads--a specific type of
attention head known for their ability to perform in-context learning--in
driving this repetitive behavior. Specifically, we focus on the "toxicity" of
induction heads, which we define as their tendency to dominate the model's
output logits during repetition, effectively excluding other attention heads
from contributing to the generation process. Our findings have important
implications for the design and training of LLMs. By identifying induction
heads as a key driver of the repetition curse, we provide a mechanistic
explanation for this phenomenon and suggest potential avenues for mitigation.
We also propose a technique with attention head regularization that could be
employed to reduce the dominance of induction heads during generation, thereby
promoting more diverse and coherent outputs.

TL;DR: LogiBreak是一种新型通用黑盒方法，通过逻辑表达式转换绕过LLMs的安全机制。

Motivation: 现有安全机制对越狱攻击脆弱，需研究分布差异。

Method: 将恶意提示转换为逻辑表达式，利用分布差异绕过安全系统。

Result: 在跨语言数据集上验证了LogiBreak的有效性。

Conclusion: 逻辑转换能有效绕过LLMs安全约束，需改进对齐方法。

Abstract: Despite substantial advancements in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values, current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to jailbreak
attacks. We hypothesize that this vulnerability stems from distributional
discrepancies between alignment-oriented prompts and malicious prompts. To
investigate this, we introduce LogiBreak, a novel and universal black-box
jailbreak method that leverages logical expression translation to circumvent
LLM safety systems. By converting harmful natural language prompts into formal
logical expressions, LogiBreak exploits the distributional gap between
alignment data and logic-based inputs, preserving the underlying semantic
intent and readability while evading safety constraints. We evaluate LogiBreak
on a multilingual jailbreak dataset spanning three languages, demonstrating its
effectiveness across various evaluation settings and linguistic contexts.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何结合大型语言模型（LLM）和神经机器翻译（NMT）系统优化翻译任务，提出了一种基于源句特征的调度策略，以实现高效翻译并减少LLM的使用。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在多任务中表现优异，但在翻译任务中存在高计算成本和延迟问题，因此需要结合NMT并优化调度策略以提高效率。

Method: 通过评估LLM与NMT在翻译任务中的表现，提出了一种基于源句特征的调度策略，仅在必要时使用LLM，以减少计算资源消耗。

Result: 实验表明，该调度策略在多语言测试集上能够以最少的LLM使用实现最优翻译性能。

Conclusion: 结合NMT和LLM的调度策略是一种有效且高效的翻译解决方案，能够平衡翻译质量和计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) shows promising performances in a variety of
downstream tasks, such as machine translation (MT). However, using LLMs for
translation suffers from high computational costs and significant latency.
Based on our evaluation, in most cases, translations using LLMs are comparable
to that generated by neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Only in
particular scenarios, LLM and NMT models show respective advantages. As a
result, integrating NMT and LLM for translation and using LLM only when
necessary seems to be a sound solution. A scheduling policy that optimizes
translation result while ensuring fast speed and as little LLM usage as
possible is thereby required. We compare several scheduling policies and
propose a novel and straightforward decider that leverages source sentence
features. We conduct extensive experiments on multilingual test sets and the
result shows that we can achieve optimal translation performance with minimal
LLM usage, demonstrating effectiveness of our decider.

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs需专门训练以处理多语言混合数据，避免常见错误。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet its comprehensibility remains underexplored in LLMs. We introduce
CS-Sum, to evaluate the comprehensibility of CS by the LLMs through CS dialogue
to English summarization. CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue
summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and
Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language
pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze
performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA
on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on
automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete
meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors
that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and
LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs,
underscoring the need for specialized training on code-switched data.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉信息（如图像标题）可替代双语文本用于多语言句子表征对齐，尤其适合低资源语言。

Motivation: 探索是否可以通过视觉信息替代双语文本，实现多语言句子表征的对齐，提高低资源语言的处理效率。

Method: 利用多语言图像-标题数据集进行对齐实验，测试未在预训练中见过的语言的表征对齐能力。

Result: 多语言图像-标题对齐能隐式对齐不同语言的文本表征，支持跨语言自然语言理解和双语文本检索。

Conclusion: 视觉信息可作为双语文本的高效替代，扩展多语言表征对齐的应用范围。

Abstract: Multilingual alignment of sentence representations has mostly required
bitexts to bridge the gap between languages. We investigate whether visual
information can bridge this gap instead. Image caption datasets are very easy
to create without requiring multilingual expertise, so this offers a more
efficient alternative for low-resource languages. We find that multilingual
image-caption alignment can implicitly align the text representations between
languages, languages unseen by the encoder in pretraining can be incorporated
into this alignment post-hoc, and these aligned representations are usable for
cross-lingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and bitext retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于算法信息理论的跨脚本统一度量方法，用于量化拼写与语音之间的正字法透明度，结合不规则拼写和规则复杂性，并通过神经序列模型验证了其有效性。

Motivation: 现有正字法透明度缺乏统一的跨脚本度量方法，因此需要一种普适性强的量化指标。

Method: 利用算法信息理论的思路，通过拼写与语音字符串的相互压缩性量化透明度，并使用神经序列模型估算。

Result: 在22种不同脚本类型语言中验证了方法的有效性，结果支持脚本透明度的常见直觉。

Conclusion: 相互压缩性是一种简单、原则性强且通用的正字法透明度度量标准。

Abstract: Orthographic transparency -- how directly spelling is related to sound --
lacks a unified, script-agnostic metric. Using ideas from algorithmic
information theory, we quantify orthographic transparency in terms of the
mutual compressibility between orthographic and phonological strings. Our
measure provides a principled way to combine two factors that decrease
orthographic transparency, capturing both irregular spellings and rule
complexity in one quantity. We estimate our transparency measure using
prequential code-lengths derived from neural sequence models. Evaluating 22
languages across a broad range of script types (alphabetic, abjad, abugida,
syllabic, logographic) confirms common intuitions about relative transparency
of scripts. Mutual compressibility offers a simple, principled, and general
yardstick for orthographic transparency.

Motivation: 识别宣传技术中的逻辑谬误和情感诉求对于做出明智决策至关重要，NLP的发展为此提供了可能。

Method: 研究比较了多种大语言模型（如GPT-4、GPT-3.5、Claude 3 Opus）与基于Transformer的模型（如RoBERTa-CRF）在检测宣传技术上的表现。

Result: GPT-4在F1得分（0.16）上优于其他LLMs，但低于RoBERTa-CRF基准（0.67）。部分LLMs在检测特定宣传技术（如name-calling、appeal to fear和flag-waving）上优于MGN基准。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4在部分任务中表现优异，但RoBERTa-CRF仍为更优选择。

Abstract: Propagandists use rhetorical devices that rely on logical fallacies and
emotional appeals to advance their agendas. Recognizing these techniques is key
to making informed decisions. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) have enabled the development of systems capable of detecting manipulative
content. In this study, we look at several Large Language Models and their
performance in detecting propaganda techniques in news articles. We compare the
performance of these LLMs with transformer-based models. We find that, while
GPT-4 demonstrates superior F1 scores (F1=0.16) compared to GPT-3.5 and Claude
3 Opus, it does not outperform a RoBERTa-CRF baseline (F1=0.67). Additionally,
we find that all three LLMs outperform a MultiGranularity Network (MGN)
baseline in detecting instances of one out of six propaganda techniques
(name-calling), with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 also outperforming the MGN baseline in
detecting instances of appeal to fear and flag-waving.

Conclusion: SQLForge通过数据增强和模型微调显著提升了开源LLMs在text-to-SQL任务中的表现，缩小了与闭源模型的差距。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
text-to-SQL reasoning tasks, yet a substantial performance gap persists between
existing open-source models and their closed-source counterparts. In this
paper, we introduce SQLForge, a novel approach for synthesizing reliable and
diverse data to enhance text-to-SQL reasoning in LLMs. We improve data
reliability through SQL syntax constraints and SQL-to-question reverse
translation, ensuring data logic at both structural and semantic levels. We
also propose an SQL template enrichment and iterative data domain exploration
mechanism to boost data diversity. Building on the augmented data, we fine-tune
a variety of open-source models with different architectures and parameter

Motivation: 当前问答系统要求模型输出的准确性和透明度，但小语言模型性能不足，知识蒸馏方法通过中间推理痕迹提升性能。然而这些痕迹难以评估，研究旨在解决其忠实性及与最终性能的关联性问题。

Method: 采用基于规则的问题分解知识蒸馏方法，将复杂查询拆解为结构化的子问题，生成可解释的推理痕迹，并在Open Book QA等数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现正确推理痕迹未必导致正确的最终答案，且中间痕迹与最终答案的正确性相关性低，质疑了利用推理痕迹提升小语言模型性能的假设。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了推理痕迹与最终性能之间的不一致性，对当前知识蒸馏方法提出了挑战。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem,
particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT,
Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and
transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are
computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger
models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller
models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or
the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by
reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD.
However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or
evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the
faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final
performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem
decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into
structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can
be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this
approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step
and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our
SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft
Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the
striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model
outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation
between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These
results challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for
improving SLMs' final performance via KD.

Conclusion: 结论强调了EfficientLLM为研究人员和工程师在高效与性能之间权衡提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven significant progress, yet their
growing parameter counts and context windows incur prohibitive compute, energy,
and monetary costs. We introduce EfficientLLM, a novel benchmark and the first
comprehensive empirical study evaluating efficiency techniques for LLMs at
scale. Conducted on a production-class cluster (48xGH200, 8xH200 GPUs), our
study systematically explores three key axes: (1) architecture pretraining
(efficient attention variants: MQA, GQA, MLA, NSA; sparse Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE)), (2) fine-tuning (parameter-efficient methods: LoRA, RSLoRA, DoRA), and
(3) inference (quantization methods: int4, float16). We define six fine-grained
metrics (Memory Utilization, Compute Utilization, Latency, Throughput, Energy
Consumption, Compression Rate) to capture hardware saturation,
latency-throughput balance, and carbon cost. Evaluating over 100
model-technique pairs (0.5B-72B parameters), we derive three core insights: (i)
Efficiency involves quantifiable trade-offs: no single method is universally
optimal; e.g., MoE reduces FLOPs and improves accuracy but increases VRAM by
40%, while int4 quantization cuts memory/energy by up to 3.9x at a 3-5%
accuracy drop. (ii) Optima are task- and scale-dependent: MQA offers optimal
memory-latency trade-offs for constrained devices, MLA achieves lowest
perplexity for quality-critical tasks, and RSLoRA surpasses LoRA efficiency
only beyond 14B parameters. (iii) Techniques generalize across modalities: we
extend evaluations to Large Vision Models (Stable Diffusion 3.5, Wan 2.1) and
Vision-Language Models (Qwen2.5-VL), confirming effective transferability. By
open-sourcing datasets, evaluation pipelines, and leaderboards, EfficientLLM
provides essential guidance for researchers and engineers navigating the
efficiency-performance landscape of next-generation foundation models.

Abstract: Associative memory engages in the integration of relevant information for

between language model and brain by mapping language model activations to brain
activity, the original text stimuli expanded with simulated associative memory
are regarded as input to computational language models. We find the alignment
between language model and brain is improved in brain regions closely related
to associative memory processing. We also demonstrate large language models
after specific supervised fine-tuning better align with brain response, by
building the \textit{Association} dataset containing 1000 samples of stories,
with instructions encouraging associative memory as input and associated

Abstract: As state-of-the-art language models continue to improve, the need for robust

current state-of-the-art machine text detectors struggle to adapt to new unseen

Ensemble Networks), a technique that allows detectors to adapt to unseen
domains by ensembling a set of domain expert detector models using weights from
a domain classifier. We test DoGEN on a wide variety of domains from leading
benchmarks and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain
detection while outperforming models twice its size on out-of-domain detection.
We release our code and trained models to assist in future research in

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为推理路径压缩（RPC）的训练无关方法，通过利用推理路径的语义稀疏性来加速推理，减少内存使用和生成延迟，同时保持较高的准确性。

Motivation: 当前语言模型通过生成冗长的中间推理路径来解决逻辑问题，但这增加了内存使用和生成延迟，限制了实际部署。为解决这一问题，论文提出RPC方法。

Method: RPC采用训练无关的方式，通过周期性压缩KV缓存，保留高重要性评分的部分，这些评分通过最近生成的查询组成的选择器窗口计算。

Result: 实验表明，相比于完整的KV缓存，RPC在QwQ-32B模型上将生成吞吐量提高至1.60倍，同时在AIME 2024基准测试中准确率仅下降1.2%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，推理路径的语义稀疏性可有效用于压缩，为推理型语言模型的高效部署提供了实践路径。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating
lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this
approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long
reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and throughput of token
generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose
Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates
inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC
periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining KV cache that receive high
importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of
recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation
throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full
KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our
findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be
effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward
efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at

Method: 通过游戏代码的逻辑结构和状态转换过程，利用LLMs生成推理数据，并开发了GameQA数据集。

Result: GameQA数据集低成本且可扩展，训练后的VLMs展现出跨领域泛化能力，如Qwen2.5-VL-7B在7个基准上性能提升2.33%。

Conclusion: 代码驱动的数据合成是一种有效方法，能够显著提升VLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Visual-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data resources are relatively scarce
compared to text-only counterparts, limiting the improvement of reasoning
capabilities in Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, high-quality
vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To
address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which
naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes.
Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for
multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning
processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we
developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is
cost-effective and scalable to produce, challenging for state-of-the-art
models, and diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training
solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization,
specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33\% across 7 diverse

Method: 提出一种图分析方法：将冗长的CoT输出聚类为语义连贯的推理步骤，并构建有向推理图以捕捉步骤间的依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能够定量评估推理质量，还为提示工程和LLMs的认知分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have enabled Large Language Models
(LLMs) to display sophisticated reasoning abilities via extended
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation. Despite their potential, these Reasoning
LLMs (RLMs) often demonstrate counterintuitive and unstable behaviors, such as
performance degradation under few-shot prompting, that challenge our current
understanding of RLMs. In this work, we introduce a unified graph-based
analytical framework for better modeling the reasoning processes of RLMs. Our
method first clusters long, verbose CoT outputs into semantically coherent
reasoning steps, then constructs directed reasoning graphs to capture
contextual and logical dependencies among these steps. Through comprehensive
analysis across models and prompting regimes, we reveal that structural
properties, such as exploration density, branching, and convergence ratios,
strongly correlate with reasoning accuracy. Our findings demonstrate how
prompting strategies substantially reshape the internal reasoning structure of
RLMs, directly affecting task outcomes. The proposed framework not only enables
quantitative evaluation of reasoning quality beyond conventional metrics but
also provides practical insights for prompt engineering and the cognitive
analysis of LLMs. Code and resources will be released to facilitate future
research in this direction.

Motivation: 现有基于logit的融合方法忽视了词汇维度间的语义依赖，影响了模型融合的效果，尤其是对于具有多样化生成行为的模型。

Method: 提出InfiGFusion框架，通过聚合top-k logits的外积构建全局共激活图，并设计了一种高效的封闭形式近似方法。

Result: 在11个基准测试中超越现有方法，尤其在复杂推理任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: InfiGFusion通过建模语义依赖，显著提升了模型融合的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified efforts to
fuse heterogeneous open-source models into a unified system that inherits their
complementary strengths. Existing logit-based fusion methods maintain inference
efficiency but treat vocabulary dimensions independently, overlooking semantic
dependencies encoded by cross-dimension interactions. These dependencies
reflect how token types interact under a model's internal reasoning and are
essential for aligning models with diverse generation behaviors. To explicitly
model these dependencies, we propose \textbf{InfiGFusion}, the first
structure-aware fusion framework with a novel \textit{Graph-on-Logits
Distillation} (GLD) loss. Specifically, we retain the top-$k$ logits per output
and aggregate their outer products across sequence positions to form a global
co-activation graph, where nodes represent vocabulary channels and edges
quantify their joint activations. To ensure scalability and efficiency, we
design a sorting-based closed-form approximation that reduces the original
$O(n^4)$ cost of Gromov-Wasserstein distance to $O(n \log n)$, with provable
approximation guarantees. Experiments across multiple fusion settings show that
GLD consistently improves fusion quality and stability. InfiGFusion outperforms
SOTA models and fusion baselines across 11 benchmarks spanning reasoning,
coding, and mathematics. It shows particular strength in complex reasoning
tasks, with +35.6 improvement on Multistep Arithmetic and +37.06 on Causal
Judgement over SFT, demonstrating superior multi-step and relational inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in
mathematical reasoning. To enable such capabilities, many existing works
distill strong reasoning models into long chains of thought or design
algorithms to construct high-quality math QA data for training. However, these
efforts primarily focus on generating correct reasoning paths and answers,
while largely overlooking the validity of the questions themselves. In this
work, we propose Math Question Verification (MathQ-Verify), a novel five-stage
pipeline designed to rigorously filter ill-posed or under-specified math
problems. MathQ-Verify first performs format-level validation to remove
redundant instructions and ensure that each question is syntactically
well-formed. It then formalizes each question, decomposes it into atomic
conditions, and verifies them against mathematical definitions. Next, it
detects logical contradictions among these conditions, followed by a
goal-oriented completeness check to ensure the question provides sufficient
information for solving. To evaluate this task, we use existing benchmarks
along with an additional dataset we construct, containing 2,147 math questions
with diverse error types, each manually double-validated. Experiments show that
MathQ-Verify achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks,
improving the F1 score by up to 25 percentage points over the direct
verification baseline. It further attains approximately 90% precision and 63%
recall through a lightweight model voting scheme. MathQ-Verify offers a
scalable and accurate solution for curating reliable mathematical datasets,
reducing label noise and avoiding unnecessary computation on invalid questions.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer has become a crucial aspect of multilingual NLP, as it
allows for models trained on resource-rich languages to be applied to
low-resource languages more effectively. Recently massively multilingual
pre-trained language models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) demonstrate strong zero-shot
transfer capabilities[14] [13]. This paper investigates cross-linguistic
transfer through the lens of language families and morphology. Investigating
how language family proximity and morphological similarity affect performance
across NLP tasks. We further discuss our results and how it relates to findings
from recent literature. Overall, we compare multilingual model performance and
review how linguistic distance metrics correlate with transfer outcomes. We
also look into emerging approaches that integrate typological and morphological
information into model pre-training to improve transfer to diverse
languages[18] [19].

TL;DR: 本文通过分析1500多种语言的平行数据集，提出了一种基于词类长度的通用词序变化机制，部分支持了处理理论的对立观点，并解释了比谱系或语言区域更多的方差。

Motivation: 探讨语言表面结构（词序）的起源和变化机制，调和先天论和功能论的对立观点。

Method: 使用大规模平行数据集（1500多种语言，133个语族，111个孤立语言），分析词类长度与词序的相关性。

Result: 词类长度与词序显著相关，但方式复杂；预测了两条谱系线的历史词序变化，解释力超过谱系或语言区域。

Conclusion: 提出“最小-最大”理论，整合处理和信息结构的竞争压力，支持效率导向和信息论的近期研究。

Abstract: Current theories of language propose an innate (Baker 2001; Chomsky 1981) or
a functional (Greenberg 1963; Dryer 2007; Hawkins 2014) origin for the surface
structures (i.e. word order) that we observe in languages of the world, while
evolutionary modeling (Dunn et al. 2011) suggests that descent is the primary
factor influencing such patterns. Although there are hypotheses for word order
change from both innate and usage-based perspectives for specific languages and
families, there are key disagreements between the two major proposals for
mechanisms that drive the evolution of language more broadly (Wasow 2002; Levy
2008). This paper proposes a universal underlying mechanism for word order
change based on a large tagged parallel dataset of over 1,500 languages
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates. Results indicate that word
class length is significantly correlated with word order crosslinguistically,
but not in a straightforward manner, partially supporting opposing theories of
processing, while at the same time predicting historical word order change in
two different phylogenetic lines and explaining more variance than descent or
language area in regression models. Such findings suggest an integrated
"Min-Max" theory of language evolution driven by competing pressures of
processing and information structure, aligning with recent efficiency-oriented
(Levshina 2023) and information-theoretic proposals (Zaslavsky 2020; Tucker et
al. 2025).

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为R1 Translator的新模型，用于改进EEG到文本的解码性能，结合双向LSTM编码器和预训练transformer解码器，显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有EEG信号解码模型性能有限，需要改进以更好地连接人脑与语言处理。

Method: R1 Translator模型结合双向LSTM编码器和预训练transformer解码器，利用EEG特征生成高质量文本。

Result: 在ROUGE、CER和WER指标上均优于T5和Brain Translator，如ROUGE-1得分提升9%。

Conclusion: R1 Translator在EEG到文本解码任务中表现优异，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models like Gemini, GPT, and
others, bridging the gap between the human brain and language processing has
become an important area of focus. To address this challenge, researchers have
developed various models to decode EEG signals into text. However, these models
still face significant performance limitations. To overcome these shortcomings,
we propose a new model, R1 Translator, which aims to improve the performance of
EEG-to-text decoding. The R1 Translator model combines a bidirectional LSTM
encoder with a pretrained transformer-based decoder, utilizing EEG features to
produce high-quality text outputs. The model processes EEG embeddings through
the LSTM to capture sequential dependencies, which are then fed into the
transformer decoder for effective text generation. The R1 Translator excels in
ROUGE metrics, outperforming both T5 (previous research) and Brain Translator.
Specifically, R1 achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 38.00% (P), which is up to 9%
higher than T5 (34.89%) and 3% better than Brain (35.69%). It also leads in
ROUGE-L, with a F1 score of 32.51%, outperforming T5 by 3% (29.67%) and Brain
by 2% (30.38%). In terms of CER, R1 achieves a CER of 0.5795, which is 2% lower
than T5 (0.5917) and 4% lower than Brain (0.6001). Additionally, R1 performs
better in WER with a score of 0.7280, outperforming T5 by 4.3% (0.7610) and
Brain by 3.6% (0.7553). Code is available at

Motivation: 传统的基于记忆的方法在持续关系提取中存在内存和隐私问题，而现有的基于提示的方法在任务识别和防止灾难性遗忘方面表现不佳。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出WAVE++方法，结合任务特定提示池、标签描述和生成模型，优化提示选择并防止遗忘，无需存储历史数据。

Result: 实验证明WAVE++在持续关系提取任务中优于当前最先进的基于提示和基于记忆的方法。

Conclusion: WAVE++为持续关系提取提供了更高效的解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Memory-based approaches have shown strong performance in Continual Relation
Extraction (CRE). However, storing examples from previous tasks increases
memory usage and raises privacy concerns. Recently, prompt-based methods have
emerged as a promising alternative, as they do not rely on storing past
samples. Despite this progress, current prompt-based techniques face several
core challenges in CRE, particularly in accurately identifying task identities
and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing prompt selection strategies
often suffer from inaccuracies, lack robust mechanisms to prevent forgetting in
shared parameters, and struggle to handle both cross-task and within-task
variations. In this paper, we propose WAVE++, a novel approach inspired by the
connection between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts. Specifically, we
introduce task-specific prompt pools that enhance flexibility and adaptability
across diverse tasks while avoiding boundary-spanning risks; this design more
effectively captures variations within each task and across tasks. To further
refine relation classification, we incorporate label descriptions that provide
richer, more global context, enabling the model to better distinguish among
different relations. We also propose a training-free mechanism to improve task
prediction during inference. Moreover, we integrate a generative model to
consolidate prior knowledge within the shared parameters, thereby removing the
need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WAVE++
outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-based methods, offering
a more robust solution for continual relation extraction. Our code is publicly

Motivation: 现有的EQA框架以规划器为中心，记忆模块无法与其他模块充分交互，限制了处理复杂任务的能力。

Method: 设计了一个多模态分层记忆机制，包含全局记忆和局部记忆，并利用多模态大语言模型将记忆信息转换为各模块所需的输入格式。

Result: 在HM-EQA、MT-HM3D和OpenEQA数据集上验证了框架的有效性，尤其在MT-HM3D上性能提升了19.8%。

Conclusion: MemoryEQA框架通过强化记忆能力，显著提升了EQA任务中复杂问题的处理性能。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to autonomously explore and
understand the environment to answer context-dependent questions. Existing
frameworks typically center around the planner, which guides the stopping
module, memory module, and answering module for reasoning. In this paper, we
propose a memory-centric EQA framework named MemoryEQA. Unlike planner-centric
EQA models where the memory module cannot fully interact with other modules,
MemoryEQA flexible feeds memory information into all modules, thereby enhancing
efficiency and accuracy in handling complex tasks, such as those involving
multiple targets across different regions. Specifically, we establish a
multi-modal hierarchical memory mechanism, which is divided into global memory
that stores language-enhanced scene maps, and local memory that retains
historical observations and state information. When performing EQA tasks, the
multi-modal large language model is leveraged to convert memory information
into the required input formats for injection into different modules. To
evaluate EQA models' memory capabilities, we constructed the MT-HM3D dataset
based on HM3D, comprising 1,587 question-answer pairs involving multiple
targets across various regions, which requires agents to maintain memory of
exploration-acquired target information. Experimental results on HM-EQA,
MT-HM3D, and OpenEQA demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, where a
19.8% performance gain on MT-HM3D compared to baseline model further
underscores memory capability's pivotal role in resolving complex tasks.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在推理任务中生成冗长内容导致计算开销大，实验显示模型在推理过程中可能过早得出正确答案，因此研究如何提前终止推理以提高效率。

Method: 引入验证模型来识别模型何时可以停止推理但仍能提供正确答案，从而缩短推理内容。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，FlashThink将Deepseek-R1和QwQ-32B模型的推理内容长度分别减少77.04%和77.47%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: FlashThink方法成功实现了高效推理的目标，显著减少了推理内容的冗余。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in reasoning
tasks. However, LLMs tend to generate excessively long reasoning content,
leading to significant computational overhead. Our observations indicate that
even on simple problems, LLMs tend to produce unnecessarily lengthy reasoning
content, which is against intuitive expectations. Preliminary experiments show
that at a certain point during the generation process, the model is already
capable of producing the correct solution without completing the full reasoning
content. Therefore, we consider that the reasoning process of the model can be
exited early to achieve the purpose of efficient reasoning. We introduce a
verification model that identifies the exact moment when the model can stop
reasoning and still provide the correct answer. Comprehensive experiments on
four different benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method, FlashThink,
effectively shortens the reasoning content while preserving the model accuracy.
For the Deepseek-R1 and QwQ-32B models, we reduced the length of reasoning
content by 77.04% and 77.47%, respectively, without reducing the accuracy.

TL;DR: 量化方法广泛用于加速大型语言模型（LLM）的推理，但其对模型可解释性的影响尚未被研究。本文通过实验发现，量化对可解释性的影响因方法、评估协议不同而异，甚至可能提升可解释性。

Motivation: 量化对LLM的推理速度有益，但其对模型透明度和可解释性的影响尚未被充分研究，这对于依赖透明决策的应用至关重要。

Method: 使用三种常见量化技术和不同比特宽度，结合两种可解释性方法（反事实示例和自然语言解释）和两种可解释性分析（知识记忆分析和潜在多跳推理分析），并辅以用户研究。

Result: 量化对可解释性的影响不一致，取决于量化方法、可解释性方法及评估协议；某些情况下量化会降低可解释性，而在其他情况下可能提升。

Conclusion: 量化可能不可预测地影响模型透明度，对需要透明决策的LLM应用部署具有重要启示。

Abstract: Quantization methods are widely used to accelerate inference and streamline
the deployment of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has
extensively investigated the degradation of various LLM capabilities due to
quantization, its effects on model explainability and interpretability, which
are crucial for understanding decision-making processes, remain unexplored. To
address this gap, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three common
quantization techniques at distinct bit widths, in conjunction with two
explainability methods, counterfactual examples and natural language
explanations, as well as two interpretability approaches, knowledge
memorization analysis and latent multi-hop reasoning analysis. We complement
our analysis with a thorough user study, evaluating selected explainability
methods. Our findings reveal that, depending on the configuration, quantization
can significantly impact model explainability and interpretability. Notably,
the direction of this effect is not consistent, as it strongly depends on (1)
the quantization method, (2) the explainability or interpretability approach,
and (3) the evaluation protocol. In some settings, human evaluation shows that
quantization degrades explainability, while in others, it even leads to
improvements. Our work serves as a cautionary tale, demonstrating that
quantization can unpredictably affect model transparency. This insight has
important implications for deploying LLMs in applications where transparency is
a critical requirement.

Motivation: 传统AES方法在多模态感知和评分泛化性方面表现不佳，而现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）也可能产生幻觉性解释或与人类评分不一致的问题。因此，需要一种更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 提出CAFES框架，通过三个专门代理协同工作：初始评分代理进行快速、基于特征的评分；反馈池管理者收集详细的、基于证据的优点反馈；反思评分代理迭代优化评分以提高与人类评分的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，CAFES在Quadratic Weighted Kappa（QWK）指标上相对提升了21%，尤其在语法和词汇多样性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CAFES为智能多模态AES系统的发展奠定了基础，展示了多代理协作在评分任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is crucial for modern education, particularly
with the increasing prevalence of multimodal assessments. However, traditional
AES methods struggle with evaluation generalizability and multimodal
perception, while even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based
approaches can produce hallucinated justifications and scores misaligned with
human judgment. To address the limitations, we introduce CAFES, the first
collaborative multi-agent framework specifically designed for AES. It
orchestrates three specialized agents: an Initial Scorer for rapid,
trait-specific evaluations; a Feedback Pool Manager to aggregate detailed,
evidence-grounded strengths; and a Reflective Scorer that iteratively refines
scores based on this feedback to enhance human alignment. Extensive
experiments, using state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieve an average relative
improvement of 21% in Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) against ground truth,
especially for grammatical and lexical diversity. Our proposed CAFES framework
paves the way for an intelligent multimodal AES system. The code will be
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 反事实数据增强（CDA）广泛用于提升大语言模型的性能和鲁棒性，但评估指标（标签翻转）的法官模型选择不一致导致结果不一致。

Method: 研究定义了反事实生成器与法官模型的四种关系，通过实验（2种LLM方法、3个数据集、5个生成器模型、15个法官模型）和用户研究（n=90）进行分析。

Result: 独立且未经微调的法官模型评估最可靠，但用户研究结果显示全自动流程效果仍有较大差距。

Conclusion: 全自动CDA流程可能不足，需要人工干预。

Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and
robustness of large language models (LLMs) through counterfactual data
augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evaluate
label flipping, the primary metric for assessing the validity of generated
counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we
define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and
judge models. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art
LLM-based methods, three datasets, five generator models, and 15 judge models,
complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an
independent, non-fine-tuned relationship to the generator model provide the
most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relationships between the generator
and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result
in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap
between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user
study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline
for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based tuning has shifted the trajectory
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly following the
introduction of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, directly
applying it to medical tasks remains challenging for achieving clinically
grounded model behavior. Motivated by the need to align model response with
clinical expectations, we investigate four critical dimensions that affect the
effectiveness of RL-based tuning in medical visual question answering (VQA):
base model initialization strategy, the role of medical semantic alignment, the
impact of length-based rewards on long-chain reasoning, and the influence of
bias. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze these factors for medical
MLLMs, providing new insights into how models are domain-specifically
fine-tuned. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that GRPO-based RL
tuning consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both
accuracy and reasoning quality.

Result: 在GSM8K上，token使用减少65%，准确率提升2.4%；AIME上token减少43%，性能无下降。

Conclusion: 训练与学生的推理能力对齐的CoT结构对知识迁移和性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated success in complex
reasoning tasks through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, their inference
often involves excessively verbose reasoning traces, resulting in substantial
inefficiency. To address this, we propose Distilled Reasoning Pruning (DRP), a
hybrid framework that combines inference-time pruning with tuning-based
distillation, two widely used strategies for efficient reasoning. DRP uses a
teacher model to perform skill-aware step decomposition and content pruning,
and then distills the pruned reasoning paths into a student model, enabling it
to reason both efficiently and accurately. Across several challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets, we find that models trained with DRP achieve
substantial improvements in token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
Specifically, DRP reduces average token usage on GSM8K from 917 to 328 while
improving accuracy from 91.7% to 94.1%, and achieves a 43% token reduction on
AIME with no performance drop. Further analysis shows that aligning the
reasoning structure of training CoTs with the student's reasoning capacity is
critical for effective knowledge transfer and performance gains.

Conclusion: 分歧可作为识别挑战性样本和提升共情系统鲁棒性的诊断信号。

Abstract: Multimodal models play a key role in empathy detection, but their performance
can suffer when modalities provide conflicting cues. To understand these
failures, we examine cases where unimodal and multimodal predictions diverge.
Using fine-tuned models for text, audio, and video, along with a gated fusion
model, we find that such disagreements often reflect underlying ambiguity, as
evidenced by annotator uncertainty. Our analysis shows that dominant signals in
one modality can mislead fusion when unsupported by others. We also observe
that humans, like models, do not consistently benefit from multimodal input.
These insights position disagreement as a useful diagnostic signal for
identifying challenging examples and improving empathy system robustness.

TL;DR: 本文研究了强化微调（RFT）对大型语言模型（LLM）信任度的影响，发现RFT会导致模型在无法回答的问题上产生幻觉回答（称为“幻觉税”），并通过引入SUM数据集证明调整RFT训练可以显著恢复模型的拒绝行为。

Motivation: 探索RFT在提升LLM推理能力的同时对模型信任度的副作用，尤其是模型在无法回答问题时产生的幻觉回答现象。

Method: 引入SUM数据集（合成的无解数学问题集），用于测试模型识别无法回答问题的能力，并通过调整RFT训练（如加入10% SUM数据）评估对模型拒绝行为的影响。

Result: 标准RFT训练会降低模型拒绝率80%以上，增加幻觉回答倾向；加入少量SUM数据后，能显著恢复拒绝行为且不影响可解任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 调整RFT训练可帮助模型更好地识别不确定性，提升对无法回答问题的拒绝能力，同时扩展到其他任务（如事实问答）。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has become a standard approach for enhancing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its impact
on model trustworthiness remains underexplored. In this work, we identify and
systematically study a critical side effect of RFT, which we term the
hallucination tax: a degradation in refusal behavior causing models to produce
hallucinated answers to unanswerable questions confidently. To investigate
this, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), a high-quality dataset of
unanswerable math problems designed to probe models' ability to recognize an
unanswerable question by reasoning from the insufficient or ambiguous
information. Our results show that standard RFT training could reduce model
refusal rates by more than 80%, which significantly increases model's tendency
to hallucinate. We further demonstrate that incorporating just 10% SUM during
RFT substantially restores appropriate refusal behavior, with minimal accuracy
trade-offs on solvable tasks. Crucially, this approach enables LLMs to leverage
inference-time compute to reason about their own uncertainty and knowledge
boundaries, improving generalization not only to out-of-domain math problems
but also to factual question answering tasks.

Result: 实验表明DecIF在指令跟随任务中表现优异，展现了灵活性、可扩展性和泛化性。

Conclusion: DecIF为自动合成高质量指令数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-following has emerged as a crucial capability for large language
models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on pre-existing
documents or external resources to synthesize instruction-following data, which
limits their flexibility and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce
DecIF, a fully autonomous, meta-decomposition guided framework that generates
diverse and high-quality instruction-following data using only LLMs. DecIF is
grounded in the principle of decomposition. For instruction generation, we
guide LLMs to iteratively produce various types of meta-information, which are
then combined with response constraints to form well-structured and
semantically rich instructions. We further utilize LLMs to detect and resolve
potential inconsistencies within the generated instructions. Regarding response
generation, we decompose each instruction into atomic-level evaluation
criteria, enabling rigorous validation and the elimination of inaccurate
instruction-response pairs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
scenarios and settings demonstrate DecIF's superior performance on
instruction-following tasks. Further analysis highlights its strong
flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in automatically synthesizing
high-quality instruction data.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs（大型语言模型）中的社会谄媚现象，提出了一种更丰富的理论框架ELEPHANT，并通过实验证实了LLMs在社交谄媚行为上的高度表现。

Motivation: 现有研究仅关注LLMs对用户明确陈述信念的谄媚行为，而忽略了在无明确事实依据的模糊情境（如建议和支持寻求）中出现的谄媚行为，这些行为可能强化有害的隐性假设或行为。

Method: 提出了ELEPHANT框架，从五种维护用户面子的行为（情感验证、道德认可、间接语言、间接行动和接受框架）评估社交谄媚，并在OEQ和AITA两个数据集上测试了八个LLMs模型。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs表现出较高的社交谄媚倾向：在OEQ上比人类多47%的面子维护行为，在AITA上有42%的情况支持被人类判定为不当的行为。此外，社交谄媚在偏好数据集中受到奖励且不易缓解。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解和解决LLMs中的社会谄媚问题提供了理论支持和实证工具（数据集和代码）。

Abstract: A serious risk to the safety and utility of LLMs is sycophancy, i.e.,
excessive agreement with and flattery of the user. Yet existing work focuses on
only one aspect of sycophancy: agreement with users' explicitly stated beliefs
that can be compared to a ground truth. This overlooks forms of sycophancy that
arise in ambiguous contexts such as advice and support-seeking, where there is
no clear ground truth, yet sycophancy can reinforce harmful implicit
assumptions, beliefs, or actions. To address this gap, we introduce a richer
theory of social sycophancy in LLMs, characterizing sycophancy as the excessive
preservation of a user's face (the positive self-image a person seeks to
maintain in an interaction). We present ELEPHANT, a framework for evaluating
social sycophancy across five face-preserving behaviors (emotional validation,
moral endorsement, indirect language, indirect action, and accepting framing)
on two datasets: open-ended questions (OEQ) and Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole
(AITA). Across eight models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates
of social sycophancy: on OEQ, they preserve face 47% more than humans, and on
AITA, they affirm behavior deemed inappropriate by crowdsourced human judgments
in 42% of cases. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in
preference datasets and is not easily mitigated. Our work provides theoretical
grounding and empirical tools (datasets and code) for understanding and
addressing this under-recognized but consequential issue.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的模型合并方法ACM，通过激活信息动态调整层权重，以高效结合不同LLM的能力，显著提升了效率和性能。

Motivation: 为解决现有模型合并方法忽略神经网络层功能异质性导致的效率与稳定性问题。

Method: 提出ACM框架，基于预训练与微调模型的激活互信息动态确定层特异性合并系数。

Result: 在L2S和通用任务中，ACM显著优于基线方法，如Qwen-7B模型响应长度减少55.3%，推理准确率提升1.3分。

Conclusion: ACM无需梯度计算或额外训练即可有效保留任务能力，为模型合并提供高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on reconciling the reasoning
capabilities of System 2 with the efficiency of System 1. While existing
training-based and prompt-based approaches face significant challenges in terms
of efficiency and stability, model merging emerges as a promising strategy to
integrate the diverse capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs)
into a unified model. However, conventional model merging methods often assume
uniform importance across layers, overlooking the functional heterogeneity
inherent in neural components. To address this limitation, we propose
\textbf{A}ctivation-Guided \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{M}erging (\textbf{ACM}),
a plug-and-play merging framework that determines layer-specific merging
coefficients based on mutual information between activations of pre-trained and
fine-tuned models. ACM effectively preserves task-specific capabilities without
requiring gradient computations or additional training. Extensive experiments
on Long-to-Short (L2S) and general merging tasks demonstrate that ACM
consistently outperforms all baseline methods. For instance, in the case of
Qwen-7B models, TIES-Merging equipped with ACM achieves a \textbf{55.3\%}
reduction in response length while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy
by \textbf{1.3} points. We submit the code with the paper for reproducibility,
and it will be publicly available.

TL;DR: AutoLaw是一种新型法律框架，结合对抗性数据生成和陪审团启发的审议流程，以增强LLMs的法律合规性。

Motivation: 现有法律评估基准缺乏适应性，无法应对多样化的本地法律情境，AutoLaw填补这一空白。

Method: 采用对抗性数据生成和基于陪审团的审议流程，动态合成案例法并模拟司法决策。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，显著提高了违规检测率和LLM判别能力。

Conclusion: AutoLaw能自适应探测法律偏差，提供可靠、上下文感知的判决，适用于法律敏感应用。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) in
fields like law necessitates frameworks that account for nuanced regional legal
distinctions, which are critical for ensuring compliance and trustworthiness.
Existing legal evaluation benchmarks often lack adaptability and fail to
address diverse local contexts, limiting their utility in dynamically evolving
regulatory landscapes. To address these gaps, we propose AutoLaw, a novel
violation detection framework that combines adversarial data generation with a
jury-inspired deliberation process to enhance legal compliance of LLMs. Unlike
static approaches, AutoLaw dynamically synthesizes case law to reflect local
regulations and employs a pool of LLM-based "jurors" to simulate judicial
decision-making. Jurors are ranked and selected based on synthesized legal
expertise, enabling a deliberation process that minimizes bias and improves
detection accuracy. Evaluations across three benchmarks: Law-SG, Case-SG
(legality), and Unfair-TOS (policy), demonstrate AutoLaw's effectiveness:
adversarial data generation improves LLM discrimination, while the jury-based
voting strategy significantly boosts violation detection rates. Our results
highlight the framework's ability to adaptively probe legal misalignments and
deliver reliable, context-aware judgments, offering a scalable solution for
evaluating and enhancing LLMs in legally sensitive applications.

Method: 提出TED2025语料库（113种语言，最多50种语言平行对齐），并研究继续预训练、指令调优等策略。

Result: 实验表明，基于平行数据的模型在多语言基准测试中表现优于非对齐数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 多语言平行数据能显著提升大型语言模型的跨语言性能。

Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data
have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to
low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its
ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way
parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages,
provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for
improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale,
high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus
spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring
extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best
practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including
strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of
key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that
models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained
on unaligned multilingual data.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法常导致性能显著下降或需要大量重新训练和微调，本文旨在开发一种更高效的剪枝技术，以生成更小、更快的模型。

Method: 提出了MAMA Pruning（运动和幅度分析）方法，利用预训练阶段的权重和偏差固定以及后训练阶段的GRPO奖励验证作为剪枝指标。

Result: 初步实验结果表明，该方法在各种剪枝级别和不同下游计算语言学任务中表现优于或可比肩现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAMA Pruning能够在极端剪枝水平下显著优化模型，同时保持高性能，为大型语言模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Model pruning is a performance optimization technique for large language
models like R1 or o3-mini. However, existing pruning methods often lead to
significant performance degradation or require extensive retraining and
fine-tuning. This technique aims to identify and remove neurons, connections
unlikely leading to the contribution during the human-computer interaction
phase. Our goal is to obtain a much smaller and faster knowledge distilled
model that can quickly generate content almost as good as those of the unpruned
ones. We propose MAMA Pruning, short for Movement and Magnitude Analysis, an
improved pruning method that effectively reduces model size and computational
complexity while maintaining performance comparable to the original unpruned
model even at extreme pruned levels. The improved method is based on weights,
bias fixed in the pre-training phase and GRPO rewards verified during the
post-training phase as our novel pruning indicators. Preliminary experimental
results show that our method outperforms and be comparable to state-of-the-art
methods across various pruning levels and different downstream computational
linguistics tasks.

Conclusion: HKS能有效提升模型的通用能力和领域特定能力。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to
the quality of its training data. Although several studies have proposed
methods for high-quality data selection, they do not consider the importance of
knowledge richness in text corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel and
gradient-free High-Knowledge Scorer (HKS) to select high-quality data from the
dimension of knowledge, to alleviate the problem of knowledge scarcity in the
pre-trained corpus. We propose a comprehensive multi-domain knowledge element
pool and introduce knowledge density and coverage as metrics to assess the
knowledge content of the text. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive
knowledge scorer to select data with intensive knowledge, which can also be
utilized for domain-specific high-knowledge data selection by restricting
knowledge elements to the specific domain. We train models on a high-knowledge
bilingual dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that our scorer
improves the model's performance in knowledge-intensive and general
comprehension tasks, and is effective in enhancing both the generic and
domain-specific capabilities of the model.

Method: 设计了BAR代理，包含递归目标分解、状态一致性维持和阶段记忆模块，从终端状态开始进行规划。

Result: 实验证明BAR优于现有方法，且各模块有效。

Conclusion: 反向推理在复杂任务规划中表现优越，BAR代理展示了高效和一致性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown great potential in
following human instructions and automatically completing various tasks. To
complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by
planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps
should be executed next starting from the agent's initial state. However, this
forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to
study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex
tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward
reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state
and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the
planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task
goal in one step. Specifically, we design a BAckward Reasoning based agent
(BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state
consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust,
consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BAR over existing methods
and the effectiveness of proposed modules.

TL;DR: 该论文指出语言模型编码并延续了有害的性别刻板印象，提出对性别偏见的定义需更广泛，并通过实证研究揭示了语言模型将性别与生物性别强关联的问题。

Motivation: 现有研究仅通过解耦性别相关术语与非性别术语缓解性别偏见，但忽视了性别建构本身带来的更深刻问题，如对跨性别和非二元性别身份的忽视。

Method: 从性别研究文献中提取性别建构见解，并对16种不同架构、训练数据和规模的语言模型进行实证测试。

Result: 语言模型倾向于将性别编码为与生物性别相关的二元类别，模糊或病理化不符合二元分类的性别术语。更大规模的模型强化了性别与生物性别的关联。

Conclusion: 需要重新评估和定义语言模型中的性别偏见，以更全面地解决性别多样性及相关危害。

Abstract: Language models encode and subsequently perpetuate harmful gendered
stereotypes. Research has succeeded in mitigating some of these harms, e.g. by
dissociating non-gendered terms such as occupations from gendered terms such as
'woman' and 'man'. This approach, however, remains superficial given that
associations are only one form of prejudice through which gendered harms arise.
Critical scholarship on gender, such as gender performativity theory,
emphasizes how harms often arise from the construction of gender itself, such
as conflating gender with biological sex. In language models, these issues
could lead to the erasure of transgender and gender diverse identities and
cause harms in downstream applications, from misgendering users to
misdiagnosing patients based on wrong assumptions about their anatomy.
  For FAccT research on gendered harms to go beyond superficial linguistic
associations, we advocate for a broader definition of 'gender bias' in language
models. We operationalize insights on the construction of gender through
language from gender studies literature and then empirically test how 16
language models of different architectures, training datasets, and model sizes
encode gender. We find that language models tend to encode gender as a binary
category tied to biological sex, and that gendered terms that do not neatly
fall into one of these binary categories are erased and pathologized. Finally,
we show that larger models, which achieve better results on performance
benchmarks, learn stronger associations between gender and sex, further
reinforcing a narrow understanding of gender. Our findings lead us to call for
a re-evaluation of how gendered harms in language models are defined and
addressed.

Motivation: KBQA中LLM方法存在知识过时、幻觉和透明度问题，而KG-RAG方法仅适用于简单链式问题。

Method: 提出PDRR框架，包含预测问题类型、分解为三元组、检索KB信息及LLM推理。

Result: PDRR在不同LLM骨干上表现优异，适用于链式和非链式复杂问题。

Conclusion: PDRR通过结构化方法提升KBQA性能，扩展了适用范围。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using structured knowledge from KBs. While LLM-only approaches offer
generalization, they suffer from outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and lack
of transparency. Chain-based KG-RAG methods address these issues by
incorporating external KBs, but are limited to simple chain-structured
questions due to the absence of planning and logical structuring. Inspired by
semantic parsing methods, we propose PDRR: a four-stage framework consisting of
Predict, Decompose, Retrieve, and Reason. Our method first predicts the
question type and decomposes the question into structured triples. Then
retrieves relevant information from KBs and guides the LLM as an agent to
reason over and complete the decomposed triples. Experimental results
demonstrate that PDRR consistently outperforms existing methods across various
LLM backbones and achieves superior performance on both chain-structured and
non-chain complex questions.

Method: 从开放域知识图谱中挖掘并筛选高质量KG路径，构建MultiHal基准，并通过KG-RAG方法进行基线评估。

Conclusion: MultiHal有助于推动基于图谱的幻觉减轻和事实核查任务的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have inherent limitations of faithfulness and
factuality, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Several benchmarks have
been developed that provide a test bed for factuality evaluation within the
context of English-centric datasets, while relying on supplementary informative
context like web links or text passages but ignoring the available structured
factual resources. To this end, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been identified as
a useful aid for hallucination mitigation, as they provide a structured way to
represent the facts about entities and their relations with minimal linguistic
overhead. We bridge the lack of KG paths and multilinguality for factual
language modeling within the existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks and
propose a KG-based multilingual, multihop benchmark called \textbf{MultiHal}
framed for generative text evaluation. As part of our data collection pipeline,
we mined 140k KG-paths from open-domain KGs, from which we pruned noisy
KG-paths, curating a high-quality subset of 25.9k. Our baseline evaluation
shows an absolute scale increase by approximately 0.12 to 0.36 points for the
semantic similarity score in KG-RAG over vanilla QA across multiple languages
and multiple models, demonstrating the potential of KG integration. We
anticipate MultiHal will foster future research towards several graph-based
hallucination mitigation and fact-checking tasks.

Motivation: 当前计算法学研究多关注已有规则的适用，而从司法判决中归纳隐含法律规则的研究较少，受限于模型推理效率和符号推理能力。大语言模型的崛起为此提供了新机会，但缺乏正式任务定义、基准数据集和方法论。

Method: 提出‘法律规则归纳（LRI）’任务，旨在从类似判例中提取简洁、可推广的教义规则。构建了包含5,121个案例集（总计38,088个中文案例）的基准数据集，并包含216个专家标注的测试集。

Result: 实验发现：1）当前最先进的LLMs在LRI任务上存在过度泛化和虚构问题；2）在构建数据集上训练后，LLMs在捕捉类似案例中的细微规则模式上显著改进。

Conclusion: LRI任务填补了计算法学研究中的空白，通过大语言模型实现了隐含法律规则的自动化提取。构建的基准数据集为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Legal rules encompass not only codified statutes but also implicit
adjudicatory principles derived from precedents that contain discretionary
norms, social morality, and policy. While computational legal research has
advanced in applying established rules to cases, inducing legal rules from
judicial decisions remains understudied, constrained by limitations in model
inference efficacy and symbolic reasoning capability. The advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for automating the
extraction of such latent principles, yet progress is stymied by the absence of
formal task definitions, benchmark datasets, and methodologies. To address this
gap, we formalize Legal Rule Induction (LRI) as the task of deriving concise,
generalizable doctrinal rules from sets of analogous precedents, distilling
their shared preconditions, normative behaviors, and legal consequences. We
introduce the first LRI benchmark, comprising 5,121 case sets (38,088 Chinese
cases in total) for model tuning and 216 expert-annotated gold test sets.
Experimental results reveal that: 1) State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with
over-generalization and hallucination; 2) Training on our dataset markedly
enhances LLMs capabilities in capturing nuanced rule patterns across similar
cases.

Abstract: We present PersonaConvBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
personalized reasoning and generation in multi-turn conversations with large

personalization or conversational structure in isolation, PersonaConvBench
integrates both, offering three core tasks: sentence classification, impact
regression, and user-centric text generation across ten diverse Reddit-based
domains. This design enables systematic analysis of how personalized
conversational context shapes LLM outputs in realistic multi-user scenarios. We
benchmark several commercial and open-source LLMs under a unified prompting
setup and observe that incorporating personalized history yields substantial
performance improvements, including a 198 percent relative gain over the best
non-conversational baseline in sentiment classification. By releasing
PersonaConvBench with evaluations and code, we aim to support research on LLMs
that adapt to individual styles, track long-term context, and produce

Method: 通过筛选来自10种顶级医学期刊的1,113对患者案例和诊断，开发了DiagnosisArena，并经过AI系统和人类专家的多轮审查。

Result: 实验显示最先进的模型（o3-mini、o1、DeepSeek-R1）在诊断推理上的准确率分别为45.82%、31.09%、17.79%。

Conclusion: DiagnosisArena揭示了当前模型在临床诊断推理上的局限性，旨在推动AI诊断能力的进一步发展。

Abstract: The emergence of groundbreaking large language models capable of performing
complex reasoning tasks holds significant promise for addressing various
scientific challenges, including those arising in complex clinical scenarios.
To enable their safe and effective deployment in real-world healthcare
settings, it is urgently necessary to benchmark the diagnostic capabilities of
current models systematically. Given the limitations of existing medical
benchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present
DiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to
rigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena
consists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses,
spanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published
in 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a
meticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and
review by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to
prevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning
models, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79%
accuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization
bottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic
reasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further

Result: 在HumanEval和MBPP数据集上，IE减少了99%的参数大小，性能与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: IE为低熵水印提供了一种安全高效的范例。

Abstract: Logit-based LLM watermarking traces and verifies AI-generated content by
maintaining green and red token lists and increasing the likelihood of green
tokens during generation. However, it fails in low-entropy scenarios, where
predictable outputs make green token selection difficult without disrupting
natural text flow. Existing approaches address this by assuming access to the
original LLM to calculate entropy and selectively watermark high-entropy
tokens. However, these methods face two major challenges: (1) high
computational costs and detection delays due to reliance on the original LLM,
and (2) potential risks of model leakage. To address these limitations, we
propose Invisible Entropy (IE), a watermarking paradigm designed to enhance
both safety and efficiency. Instead of relying on the original LLM, IE
introduces a lightweight feature extractor and an entropy tagger to predict
whether the entropy of the next token is high or low. Furthermore, based on
theoretical analysis, we develop a threshold navigator that adaptively sets
entropy thresholds. It identifies a threshold where the watermark ratio
decreases as the green token count increases, enhancing the naturalness of the
watermarked text and improving detection robustness. Experiments on HumanEval
and MBPP datasets demonstrate that IE reduces parameter size by 99\% while
achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods. Our work introduces
a safe and efficient paradigm for low-entropy watermarking.

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了一种自推理语言模型（SRLM），通过自训练合成更长的思维链数据，从而提升大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的性能。

Motivation: 现有的长思维链数据难以创建和获取，因此需要一种方法让模型自身能够生成和优化这些数据，以提高推理能力。

Method: 提出SRLM模型，利用少量示范示例作为推理催化剂，通过自训练合成更长的思维链数据并迭代改进性能。

Result: SRLM在五个推理任务中平均提升了2.5分，尤其在64次采样时平均提升达7.89分，展示了模型的深度、多样性和创造性推理能力。

Conclusion: SRLM通过自训练大幅提升了推理任务的性能，并显示出稳定且一致的改进趋势。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has attracted much attention which significantly
enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning
tasks by increasing the length of Chain-of-Thought. These longer intermediate
reasoning rationales embody various meta-reasoning skills in human cognition,
such as reflection and decomposition, being difficult to create and acquire. In
this work, we introduce \textit{Self-Reasoning Language Model} (SRLM), where
the model itself can synthesize longer CoT data and iteratively improve
performance through self-training. By incorporating a few demonstration
examples (i.e., 1,000 samples) on how to unfold hidden reasoning chains from
existing responses, which act as a reasoning catalyst, we demonstrate that SRLM
not only enhances the model's initial performance but also ensures more stable
and consistent improvements in subsequent iterations. Our proposed SRLM
achieves an average absolute improvement of more than $+2.5$ points across five
reasoning tasks: MMLU, GSM8K, ARC-C, HellaSwag, and BBH on two backbone models.
Moreover, it brings more improvements with more times of sampling during
inference, such as absolute $+7.89$ average improvement with $64$ sampling
times, revealing the in-depth, diverse and creative reasoning paths in SRLM
against the strong baseline.

TL;DR: 研究了预训练的德语BERT模型在名词复合词语义知识编码上的表现，发现其效果不如英语BERT，可能与德语的复合词生产力更高有关。

Motivation: 探究预训练德语BERT模型是否能够有效编码名词复合词的语义知识，并与英语的类似研究进行比较。

Method: 通过结合目标词、层数及大小写模型的变化，预测868个标准复合词的组合性，分析BERT架构中的表征模式。

Result: 德语BERT在早期层中更容易提取组合性信息，但整体表现明显落后于英语BERT，可能与德语复合词生产力高、成分歧义多有关。

Conclusion: 德语名词复合语义编码的难度高于英语，BERT模型的表现差异可能源于语言本身的特性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which pretrained German BERT encodes
knowledge of noun compound semantics. We comprehensively vary combinations of
target tokens, layers, and cased vs. uncased models, and evaluate them by
predicting the compositionality of 868 gold standard compounds. Looking at
representational patterns within the transformer architecture, we observe
trends comparable to equivalent prior work on English, with compositionality
information most easily recoverable in the early layers. However, our strongest
results clearly lag behind those reported for English, suggesting an inherently
more difficult task in German. This may be due to the higher productivity of
compounding in German than in English and the associated increase in
constituent-level ambiguity, including in our target compound set.

Motivation: 之前的工作表明，将表格以图像形式传递给多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的效果与文本输入大语言模型（LLMs）相当或更好，但缺乏控制实验无法区分这些方法。

Method: 通过控制实验研究表格表示（文本或图像）与模型组合的效果，并基于现有TQA数据集构建新基准。提出动态选择表示方法FRES。

Result: 实验发现最佳组合因问题复杂度和表格大小而异，FRES方法性能平均提升10%。

Conclusion: 动态选择表格表示方法能显著提升性能，需根据具体场景调整。

Abstract: In table question answering (TQA), tables are encoded as either texts or
images. Prior work suggests that passing images of tables to multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) performs comparably to or even better than using
textual input with large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
controlled setups limits fine-grained distinctions between these approaches. In
this paper, we conduct the first controlled study on the effectiveness of
several combinations of table representations and models from two perspectives:
question complexity and table size. We build a new benchmark based on existing
TQA datasets. In a systematic analysis of seven pairs of MLLMs and LLMs, we
find that the best combination of table representation and model varies across
setups. We propose FRES, a method selecting table representations dynamically,
and observe a 10% average performance improvement compared to using both
representations indiscriminately.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学术文章章节结构信息的关键词提取方法，通过结构特征和章节文本提升提取性能。

Motivation: 关键词提取（KPE）能帮助研究者高效检索文献，但现有方法受限于摘要长度或全文噪声。

Method: 结合章节结构信息和章节文本，探索七种结构特征影响，并通过关键词整合算法整合提取结果。

Result: 结构特征提升了KPE性能，关键词整合方法效果最佳；章节结构分类质量影响KPE性能。

Conclusion: 学术文章章节结构信息对关键词提取有效，研究成果代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The exponential increase in academic papers has significantly increased the
time required for researchers to access relevant literature. Keyphrase
Extraction (KPE) offers a solution to this situation by enabling researchers to
efficiently retrieve relevant literature. The current study on KPE from
academic articles aims to improve the performance of extraction models through
innovative approaches using Title and Abstract as input corpora. However, the
semantic richness of keywords is significantly constrained by the length of the
abstract. While full-text-based KPE can address this issue, it simultaneously
introduces noise, which significantly diminishes KPE performance. To address
this issue, this paper utilized the structural features and section texts
obtained from the section structure information of academic articles to extract
keyphrase from academic papers. The approach consists of two main parts: (1)
exploring the effect of seven structural features on KPE models, and (2)
integrating the extraction results from all section texts used as input corpora
for KPE models via a keyphrase integration algorithm to obtain the keyphrase
integration result. Furthermore, this paper also examined the effect of the
classification quality of section structure on the KPE performance. The results
show that incorporating structural features improves KPE performance, though
different features have varying effects on model efficacy. The keyphrase
integration approach yields the best performance, and the classification
quality of section structure can affect KPE performance. These findings
indicate that using the section structure information of academic articles
contributes to effective KPE from academic articles. The code and dataset
supporting this study are available at https://github.com/yan-xinyi/SSB_KPE.

TL;DR: 研究通过强化微调（RFT）中前提示工程（pPE）的设计，探讨不同pPE策略对语言模型行为的影响，实验显示pPE训练的模型表现优于提示工程（iPE）模型，其中null-example方法表现最佳。

Motivation: 现有RFT研究多关注算法、奖励塑造和数据优化，而前提示设计对模型行为的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 将五种iPE策略转化为pPE方法，并在Qwen2.5-7B模型上进行实验，评估在多个基准测试中的表现。

Result: 所有pPE训练的模型均优于iPE提示的模型，null-example方法在AIME2024和GPQA-Diamond上提升最大。

Conclusion: pPE是RFT中一个强大但未被充分研究的维度，不同策略能内化不同的行为风格。

Abstract: This paper investigates prior prompt engineering (pPE) in the context of
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where language models (LMs) are incentivized
to exhibit behaviors that maximize performance through reward signals. While
existing RFT research has primarily focused on algorithms, reward shaping, and
data curation, the design of the prior prompt--the instructions prepended to
queries during training to elicit behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning--remains underexplored. We investigate whether different pPE
approaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT. Inspired
by inference-time prompt engineering (iPE), we translate five representative
iPE strategies--reasoning, planning, code-based reasoning, knowledge recall,
and null-example utilization--into corresponding pPE approaches. We experiment
with Qwen2.5-7B using each of the pPE approaches, then evaluate performance on
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., AIME2024, HumanEval+, and
GPQA-Diamond). Our results show that all pPE-trained models surpass their
iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach achieving the
largest average performance gain and the highest improvement on AIME2024 and
GPQA-Diamond, surpassing the commonly used reasoning approach. Furthermore, by
adapting a behavior-classification framework, we demonstrate that different pPE
strategies instill distinct behavioral styles in the resulting models. These
findings position pPE as a powerful yet understudied axis for RFT.

TL;DR: 该研究通过激活工程技术调整LLMs的时间对齐，显著提升了模型在特定时间点的事实召回能力，且无需训练或数据集创建。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）训练数据跨越多个领域和时期，部分知识仅在特定时间范围内有效。确保LLMs生成时间上准确的回答对保持相关性和准确性至关重要。

Method: 采用激活工程技术，将LLaMA 2的三个版本对齐到特定时间点，并研究不同注入层和提示策略的效果。

Result: 实验显示，相对提示和显式提示分别提升44%和16%，与Zhao等人（2024）的微调方法性能相当，但计算效率更高且无需预对齐数据集。

Conclusion: 激活工程是一种高效的方法，可用于临时对齐LLMs以改进事实召回，而无需额外训练或数据集。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on diverse and often conflicting
knowledge spanning multiple domains and time periods. Some of this knowledge is
only valid within specific temporal contexts, such as answering the question,
"Who is the President of the United States in 2022?" Ensuring LLMs generate
time appropriate responses is crucial for maintaining relevance and accuracy.
In this work we explore activation engineering as a method for temporally
aligning LLMs to improve factual recall without any training or dataset
creation. In this research we explore an activation engineering technique to
ground three versions of LLaMA 2 to specific points in time and examine the
effects of varying injection layers and prompting strategies. Our experiments
demonstrate up to a 44% and 16% improvement in relative and explicit prompting
respectively, achieving comparable performance to the fine-tuning method
proposed by Zhao et al. (2024) . Notably, our approach achieves similar results
to the fine-tuning baseline while being significantly more computationally
efficient and requiring no pre-aligned datasets.

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示多语言视觉-语言模型中的社会偏见，尤其是资源和语法性别差异对偏见表现的影响。

Method: 使用平衡的FairFace和PATA数据集，在零样本设置下量化种族和性别偏见，并评估刻板印象的放大。

Result: 多语言模型的性别偏见强于单语言基线，低资源语言偏见更严重。跨语言权重共享将英语刻板印象传播至性别中性语言。

Conclusion: 多语言模型需细粒度、语言感知的偏见评估，以避免掩盖语言特定的偏见热点。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models promise universal image-text retrieval,
yet their social biases remain under-explored. We present the first systematic
audit of three public multilingual CLIP checkpoints -- M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, and
CAPIVARA-CLIP -- across ten languages that vary in resource availability and
grammatical gender. Using balanced subsets of \textsc{FairFace} and the
\textsc{PATA} stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and
gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the assumption
that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender bias
than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases
precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared
cross-lingual encoder of NLLB-CLIP transports English gender stereotypes into
gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this transfer.
Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all measured bias types, but
even gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable when cross-lingual weight
sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics conceal
language-specific ``hot spots,'' underscoring the need for fine-grained,
language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual vision-language research.

Motivation: 传统细粒度情感分析方法需要特定架构和大量标注数据，限制了其泛化性和可扩展性。

Method: PL-FGSA通过提示设计结合轻量级TextCNN主干，将问题重新表述为多任务提示增强生成。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PL-FGSA优于传统微调方法，F1分数分别为0.922、0.694和0.597。

Conclusion: 证明了提示学习在情感分析任务中的有效性及其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FGSA) aims to identify sentiment polarity
toward specific aspects within a text, enabling more precise opinion mining in
domains such as product reviews and social media. However, traditional FGSA
approaches often require task-specific architectures and extensive annotated
data, limiting their generalization and scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose PL-FGSA, a unified prompt learning-based framework
implemented using the MindSpore platform, which integrates prompt design with a
lightweight TextCNN backbone. Our method reformulates FGSA as a multi-task
prompt-augmented generation problem, jointly tackling aspect extraction,
sentiment classification, and causal explanation in a unified paradigm. By
leveraging prompt-based guidance, PL-FGSA enhances interpretability and
achieves strong performance under both full-data and low-resource conditions.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets-SST-2, SemEval-2014 Task 4, and
MAMS-demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms traditional
fine-tuning methods and achieves F1-scores of 0.922, 0.694, and 0.597,
respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of prompt-based
generalization and highlight the practical value of PL-FGSA for real-world
sentiment analysis tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在字符级任务（如单词字母计数）上表现不佳，原因是tokenization导致的低互信息问题。

Method: 通过19个合成任务验证字符级推理能力，并提出轻量级架构改进。

Result: 字符级能力在训练后期才突然出现，且改进架构显著提升了模型表现。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和改进LLM的结构性盲点提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress across diverse domains, Large Language
Models (LLMs) consistently fail at simple character-level tasks, such as
counting letters in words, due to a fundamental limitation: tokenization. In
this work, we frame this limitation as a problem of low mutual information and
analyze it in terms of concept emergence. Using a suite of 19 synthetic tasks
that isolate character-level reasoning in a controlled setting, we show that
such capabilities emerge slowly, suddenly, and only late in training. We
further show that percolation-based models of concept emergence explain these
patterns, suggesting that learning character composition is not fundamentally
different from learning commonsense knowledge. To address this bottleneck, we
propose a lightweight architectural modification that significantly improves
character-level reasoning while preserving the inductive advantages of subword
models. Together, our results bridge low-level perceptual gaps in tokenized LMs
and provide a principled framework for understanding and mitigating their
structural blind spots. We make our code publicly available.

TL;DR: 稀疏混合专家（MoE）在神经机器翻译（NMT）中取得了显著进展，但现有方法存在任务知识直接使用和局部专家选择的问题。THOR-MoE通过分层任务导向和上下文响应路由策略解决了这些问题，在多领域和多语言翻译任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 当前稀疏MoE方法直接使用NMT的任务知识（如领域/语言特定知识），但这些知识在实际应用中通常不可用，且未考虑自然分组的领域/语言特性。此外，专家选择仅依赖局部标记表示，忽视了上下文信息。

Method: 提出THOR-MoE，采用分层任务导向和上下文响应路由策略。首先预测领域/语言标签并提取混合表示，以分层方式分配任务级专家；然后注入上下文信息，增强从预选任务级专家集中的标记路由。

Result: THOR-MoE在多领域和多语言翻译基准测试中表现优异，兼容Top-k和Top-p路由方案。例如，上下文感知方式在Top-p路由基础上平均提高0.75 BLEU，且激活参数少于22%。

Conclusion: THOR-MoE通过分层和上下文感知路由策略显著提升了稀疏MoE的性能，具备广泛适用性。

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has achieved significant progress for
neural machine translation (NMT). However, there exist two limitations in
current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they
directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (\emph{e.g.},
domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at
practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic
properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token
representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of
each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose
THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and
context-responsive routing policies. Specifically, it 1) firstly predicts the
domain/language label and then extracts mixed domain/language representation to
allocate task-level experts in a hierarchical manner; 2) injects the context
information to enhance the token routing from the pre-selected task-level
experts set, which can help each token to be accurately routed to more
specialized and suitable experts. Extensive experiments on multi-domain
translation and multilingual translation benchmarks with different
architectures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of THOR-MoE.
Additionally, the THOR-MoE operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with
existing Top-$k$~\cite{shazeer2017} and Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing schemes, ensuring broad applicability across diverse MoE architectures.
For instance, compared with vanilla Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing, the context-aware manner can achieve an average improvement of 0.75
BLEU with less than 22\% activated parameters on multi-domain translation
tasks.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）方法如Chain-of-Thought、自洽性和微调在代码生成任务中成本高昂，每次查询可能花费数百美元，促使开发更经济的解决方案。

Method: N-rep通过利用同一模式输入的多种表示来弥补单一表示的不足，从而在不依赖昂贵推理或微调的情况下，使用小型模型实现鲁棒性。

Result: N-rep在BIRD基准测试中表现与其他高成本方法相似，每次查询成本仅为$0.039。

Conclusion: N-rep是目前在成本范围内性能最佳的文本到SQL方法。

Abstract: LLMs are effective at code generation tasks like text-to-SQL, but is it worth
the cost? Many state-of-the-art approaches use non-task-specific LLM techniques
including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), self-consistency, and fine-tuning. These
methods can be costly at inference time, sometimes requiring over a hundred LLM
calls with reasoning, incurring average costs of up to \$0.46 per query, while
fine-tuning models can cost thousands of dollars. We introduce "N-rep"
consistency, a more cost-efficient text-to-SQL approach that achieves similar
BIRD benchmark scores as other more expensive methods, at only \$0.039 per
query. N-rep leverages multiple representations of the same schema input to
mitigate weaknesses in any single representation, making the solution more
robust and allowing the use of smaller and cheaper models without any reasoning
or fine-tuning. To our knowledge, N-rep is the best-performing text-to-SQL
approach in its cost range.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了分词（Tokenization）对语言模型推理能力的限制，特别是子词分词方法（如BPE）如何模糊原子推理单元，从而阻碍符号计算。通过理论和实证研究，提出了“Token Awareness”概念，并证明原子对齐的分词格式可以显著提升推理性能。

Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示分词作为语言模型计算的第一层，其结构如何影响模型的符号推理能力，特别是Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示下的表现。

Method: 方法包括理论分析和系统性评估，对比不同分词方案（如BPE和原子对齐格式）在算术和符号任务上的推理表现，并使用小模型（如GPT-4o-mini）与大模型（如o1）进行比较。

Result: 结果显示，分词结构对推理性能有显著影响，原子对齐的分词格式能够解锁强泛化能力，使小模型在结构化推理中超越大模型。

Conclusion: 结论指出，语言模型的符号推理能力不仅取决于架构，还受分词表示方式的深刻制约。原子对齐的分词是实现高效符号计算的关键。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first - and often underappreciated - layer of computation
in language models. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables transformer
models to approximate recurrent computation by externalizing intermediate
steps, we show that the success of such reasoning is fundamentally bounded by
the structure of tokenized inputs. This work presents a theoretical and
empirical investigation into how tokenization schemes, particularly
subword-based methods like byte-pair encoding (BPE), impede symbolic
computation by merging or obscuring atomic reasoning units. We introduce the
notion of Token Awareness to formalize how poor token granularity disrupts
logical alignment and prevents models from generalizing symbolic procedures.
Through systematic evaluation on arithmetic and symbolic tasks, we demonstrate
that token structure dramatically affect reasoning performance, causing failure
even with CoT, while atomically-aligned formats unlock strong generalization,
allowing small models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to outperform larger systems (e.g.,
o1) in structured reasoning. Our findings reveal that symbolic reasoning
ability in LLMs is not purely architectural, but deeply conditioned on
token-level representations.

Motivation: 现有摘要生成方法未能充分利用科学论文的结构化信息且缺乏跨学科的鲁棒性。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先标准化章节标题并训练分类器识别关键结构；其次使用Longformer模型生成上下文感知摘要。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上优于先进基线模型，生成更全面的摘要。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效利用结构化信息并提升摘要质量。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization of scientific papers has always been a research
focus, yet existing methods face two main challenges. First, most summarization
models rely on Encoder-Decoder architectures that treat papers as sequences of
words, thus fail to fully capture the structured information inherent in
scientific papers. Second, existing research often use keyword mapping or
feature engineering to identify the structural information, but these methods
struggle with the structural flexibility of scientific papers and lack
robustness across different disciplines. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage abstractive summarization framework that leverages
automatic recognition of structural functions within scientific papers. In the
first stage, we standardize chapter titles from numerous scientific papers and
construct a large-scale dataset for structural function recognition. A
classifier is then trained to automatically identify the key structural
components (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion), which provides a
foundation for generating more balanced summaries. In the second stage, we
employ Longformer to capture rich contextual relationships across sections and
generating context-aware summaries. Experiments conducted on two
domain-specific scientific paper summarization datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms advanced baselines, and generates more comprehensive
summaries. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Result: 实验表明，SlangOWL在LLMs上显著优于非深度思考的基准模型和微调模型。

Conclusion: SlangDIT任务和SlangOWL模型为俚语翻译提供了一个有效框架，验证了深度思考方法的优势。

Abstract: The challenge of slang translation lies in capturing context-dependent
semantic extensions, as slang terms often convey meanings beyond their literal
interpretation. While slang detection, explanation, and translation have been
studied as isolated tasks in the era of large language models (LLMs), their
intrinsic interdependence remains underexplored. The main reason is lacking of
a benchmark where the two tasks can be a prerequisite for the third one, which
can facilitate idiomatic translation. In this paper, we introduce the
interpretative slang translation task (named SlangDIT) consisting of three
sub-tasks: slang detection, cross-lingual slang explanation, and slang
translation within the current context, aiming to generate more accurate
translation with the help of slang detection and slang explanation. To this
end, we construct a SlangDIT dataset, containing over 25k English-Chinese
sentence pairs. Each source sentence mentions at least one slang term and is
labeled with corresponding cross-lingual slang explanation. Based on the
benchmark, we propose a deep thinking model, named SlangOWL. It firstly
identifies whether the sentence contains a slang, and then judges whether the
slang is polysemous and analyze its possible meaning. Further, the SlangOWL
provides the best explanation of the slang term targeting on the current
context. Finally, according to the whole thought, the SlangOWL offers a
suitable translation. Our experiments on LLMs (\emph{e.g.}, Qwen2.5 and
LLama-3.1), show that our deep thinking approach indeed enhances the
performance of LLMs where the proposed SLangOWL significantly surpasses the
vanilla models and supervised fine-tuned models without thinking.

TL;DR: ThinkSwitcher框架通过动态切换长短链思维推理模式，提高大推理模型的效率，降低20-30%计算成本。

Motivation: 大推理模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但在简单任务中容易因过度推理导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 提出ThinkSwitcher框架，通过轻量级切换模块根据任务复杂度动态选择长短链思维推理模式。

Result: 在多任务推理基准测试中，ThinkSwitcher降低20-30%计算成本，同时保持复杂任务的高准确率。

Conclusion: ThinkSwitcher是一种高效且可扩展的统一大推理模型部署方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at solving complex tasks by leveraging
long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this often leads to
overthinking on simple tasks, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead.
We observe that LRMs inherently possess the capability for efficient short CoT
reasoning, which can be reliably elicited through prompt design. To leverage
this capability, we propose ThinkSwitcher, a framework that enables a single
LRM to dynamically switch between short and long CoT modes based on task
complexity. ThinkSwitcher introduces a lightweight switching module trained
with supervision signals derived from the relative performance of each
reasoning mode across tasks. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show
that ThinkSwitcher reduces computational cost by 20-30% while maintaining high
accuracy on complex tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ThinkSwitcher
as a scalable and efficient solution for unified LRM deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出首个统一框架，分析LLM在作者身份隐私中不同任务（AO、AM、AV）的动态关系及其相互作用。

Motivation: 针对LLMs可能泄露用户信息的隐私问题，研究AO、AM和AV任务之间的相互作用，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 提出统一框架，量化AO、AM和AV在LLM背景下的互动关系，并探讨了人口统计数据的调节作用。

Result: 通过实验验证了不同任务之间的动态关系及隐私风险，并公开了源代码。

Conclusion: 统一框架有助于理解LLM在作者身份隐私中的复杂作用，为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been fueled by large
scale training corpora drawn from diverse sources such as websites, news
articles, and books. These datasets often contain explicit user information,
such as person names and addresses, that LLMs may unintentionally reproduce in
their generated outputs. Beyond such explicit content, LLMs can also leak
identity revealing cues through implicit signals such as distinctive writing
styles, raising significant concerns about authorship privacy. There are three
major automated tasks in authorship privacy, namely authorship obfuscation
(AO), authorship mimicking (AM), and authorship verification (AV). Prior
research has studied AO, AM, and AV independently. However, their interplays
remain under explored, which leaves a major research gap, especially in the era
of LLMs, where they are profoundly shaping how we curate and share user
generated content, and the distinction between machine generated and human
authored text is also increasingly blurred. This work then presents the first
unified framework for analyzing the dynamic relationships among LLM enabled AO,
AM, and AV in the context of authorship privacy. We quantify how they interact
with each other to transform human authored text, examining effects at a single
point in time and iteratively over time. We also examine the role of
demographic metadata, such as gender, academic background, in modulating their
performances, inter-task dynamics, and privacy risks. All source code will be
publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发适应性强的AI系统提供了新的方向，展示了自动化生成训练数据的潜力。

Abstract: A question-answering (QA) system is to search suitable answers within a
knowledge base. Current QA systems struggle with queries requiring complex
reasoning or real-time knowledge integration. They are often supplemented with
retrieval techniques on a data source such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). However, RAG continues to face challenges in handling complex reasoning
and logical connections between multiple sources of information. A novel
approach for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive QA
tasks is presented through the automated generation of context-based QA pairs.
This methodology leverages LLMs to create fine-tuning data, reducing reliance
on human labelling and improving model comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. The proposed system includes an automated QA generator and a
model fine-tuner, evaluated using perplexity, ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improvements in logical coherence and
factual accuracy, with implications for developing adaptable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. Mistral-7b-v0.3 outperforms Llama-3-8b with BERT F1,
BLEU, and ROUGE scores 0.858, 0.172, and 0.260 of for the LLM generated QA
pairs compared to scores of 0.836, 0.083, and 0.139 for the human annotated QA
pairs.

Motivation: 现有的针对LLMs的红色团队攻击主要集中在英语上，缺乏多语言和多模态环境下的有效性研究，导致模型在这些领域仍存在漏洞。

Method: 通过代码混合和语音扰动技术，结合新的越狱策略，设计了一种能够绕过安全过滤器的攻击方法。

Result: 新型提示在文本生成中达到了99%的攻击成功率（ASR），图像生成中为78%，同时保持了高相关性（文本100%，图像95%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，语音扰动通过影响单词标记化提高了攻击成功率，呼吁加强对多语言多模态模型的安全对齐研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with
multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are
being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to
expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair
content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English
language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be
susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the
multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages
code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and
image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that
show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method
to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability
by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our
novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for
image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and
95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed
prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations
impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates
increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for
multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein
prompts can have misspelt words.

Motivation: 为了解决传统端到端微调方法在In-context Learning（ICL）上计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning（ABFT），通过调整注意力分数来优化模型行为。

Result: ABFT在性能、鲁棒性、无偏性和效率上均优于传统方法，且数据成本仅为前者的0.01%。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过控制语言模型内部模块可以优化其行为，为机制解释性开辟了未来应用方向。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) utilizes structured demonstration-query inputs to
induce few-shot learning on Language Models (LMs), which are not originally
pre-trained on ICL-style data. To bridge the gap between ICL and pre-training,
some approaches fine-tune LMs on large ICL-style datasets by an end-to-end
paradigm with massive computational costs. To reduce such costs, in this paper,
we propose Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning (ABFT), utilizing the previous
findings on the inner mechanism of ICL, building training objectives on the
attention scores instead of the final outputs, to force the attention scores to
focus on the correct label tokens presented in the context and mitigate
attention scores from the wrong label tokens. Our experiments on 9 modern LMs
and 8 datasets empirically find that ABFT outperforms in performance,
robustness, unbiasedness, and efficiency, with only around 0.01% data cost
compared to the previous methods. Moreover, our subsequent analysis finds that
the end-to-end training objective contains the ABFT objective, suggesting the
implicit bias of ICL-style data to the emergence of induction heads. Our work
demonstrates the possibility of controlling specific module sequences within
LMs to improve their behavior, opening up the future application of mechanistic
interpretability.

TL;DR: ABBA是一种新PEFT架构，通过解耦可学习低秩矩阵与预训练权重，显著提升表达力，并在多个任务中超越现有方法。

Motivation: 大语言模型虽表现优异，但高效适应新领域仍是挑战。PEFT方法通过轻量化模块实现高效微调，但现有方法如LoRA和HiRA的表达力受限。

Method: ABBA将更新参数化为两个可独立学习低秩矩阵的Hadamard积，完全解耦预训练权重，实现更高表达力。

Result: ABBA在算术和常识推理基准测试中表现最优，显著超越其他PEFT方法，并通过矩阵重构实验验证其优势。

Conclusion: ABBA通过解耦设计提供了更高表达力，是高效微调领域的重大进展。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide
range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key
challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by
introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained
weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank
decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank.
Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a
Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of
the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that
reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable
low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update
from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely.
This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter
budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its
advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA
achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning
benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant
margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at:

Result: LDA模型的连贯性得分为0.42，困惑度为-7.5；BERTopic模型异常主题比例低于20%，展示了有效分类能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为言语病理学领域的自动化文献综述提供了实用工具。

Abstract: This technical report presents a natural language processing (NLP)-based
approach for systematically classifying scientific literature on childhood
speech disorders. We retrieved and filtered 4,804 relevant articles published
after 2015 from the PubMed database using domain-specific keywords. After
cleaning and pre-processing the abstracts, we applied two topic modeling
techniques - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic - to identify
latent thematic structures in the corpus. Our models uncovered 14 clinically
meaningful clusters, such as infantile hyperactivity and abnormal epileptic
behavior. To improve relevance and precision, we incorporated a custom stop
word list tailored to speech pathology. Evaluation results showed that the LDA
model achieved a coherence score of 0.42 and a perplexity of -7.5, indicating
strong topic coherence and predictive performance. The BERTopic model exhibited
a low proportion of outlier topics (less than 20%), demonstrating its capacity
to classify heterogeneous literature effectively. These results provide a
foundation for automating literature reviews in speech-language pathology.

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) has become indispensable for cross-border
communication in globalized industries like e-commerce, finance, and legal
services, with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
significantly enhancing translation quality. However, applying general-purpose
MT models to industrial scenarios reveals critical limitations due to
domain-specific terminology, cultural nuances, and stylistic conventions absent
in generic benchmarks. Existing evaluation frameworks inadequately assess
performance in specialized contexts, creating a gap between academic benchmarks
and real-world efficacy. To address this, we propose a three-level translation
capability framework: (1) Basic Linguistic Competence, (2) Domain-Specific
Proficiency, and (3) Cultural Adaptation, emphasizing the need for holistic
evaluation across these dimensions. We introduce TransBench, a benchmark
tailored for industrial MT, initially targeting international e-commerce with
17,000 professionally translated sentences spanning 4 main scenarios and 33
language pairs. TransBench integrates traditional metrics (BLEU, TER) with
Marco-MOS, a domain-specific evaluation model, and provides guidelines for
reproducible benchmark construction. Our contributions include: (1) a
structured framework for industrial MT evaluation, (2) the first publicly
available benchmark for e-commerce translation, (3) novel metrics probing
multi-level translation quality, and (4) open-sourced evaluation tools. This
work bridges the evaluation gap, enabling researchers and practitioners to
systematically assess and enhance MT systems for industry-specific needs.

TL;DR: SLOT提出了一种新的、参数高效的测试时推理方法，通过少量优化步骤更新样本特定的参数向量，提升语言模型对复杂指令的响应能力。

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在处理复杂指令时表现不佳，尤其是那些在通用样本中代表性不足的指令。

Method: SLOT在测试时对输入提示进行少量优化步骤，更新一个轻量级的样本特定参数向量，并将其添加到最终隐藏层前。通过最小化交叉熵损失，使模型更好地与给定指令对齐。

Result: 实验表明，SLOT在多个基准测试和语言模型中表现优于对比模型，例如Qwen2.5-7B在GSM8K上准确率提升8.6%，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B在GPQA上达到68.69%的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: SLOT能够有效提升语言模型对复杂指令的处理能力，是一种高效且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: We propose SLOT (Sample-specific Language Model Optimization at Test-time), a
novel and parameter-efficient test-time inference approach that enhances a
language model's ability to more accurately respond to individual prompts.
Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex instructions,
leading to poor performances on those not well represented among general
samples. To address this, SLOT conducts few optimization steps at test-time to
update a light-weight sample-specific parameter vector. It is added to the
final hidden layer before the output head, and enables efficient adaptation by
caching the last layer features during per-sample optimization. By minimizing
the cross-entropy loss on the input prompt only, SLOT helps the model better
aligned with and follow each given instruction. In experiments, we demonstrate
that our method outperforms the compared models across multiple benchmarks and
LLMs. For example, Qwen2.5-7B with SLOT achieves an accuracy gain of 8.6% on
GSM8K from 57.54% to 66.19%, while DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B with SLOT
achieves a SOTA accuracy of 68.69% on GPQA among 70B-level models. Our code is

Conclusion: Think-J方法有效提升LLM-as-a-Judge性能，验证了其潜力。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge refers to the automatic modeling of preferences for responses
generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which is of significant importance
for both LLM evaluation and reward modeling. Although generative LLMs have made
substantial progress in various tasks, their performance as LLM-Judge still
falls short of expectations. In this work, we propose Think-J, which improves
generative LLM-as-a-Judge by learning how to think. We first utilized a small
amount of curated data to develop the model with initial judgment thinking
capabilities. Subsequently, we optimize the judgment thinking traces based on
reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two methods for judgment thinking
optimization, based on offline and online RL, respectively. The offline RL
requires training a critic model to construct positive and negative examples
for learning. The online method defines rule-based reward as feedback for
optimization. Experimental results showed that our approach can significantly
enhance the evaluation capability of generative LLM-Judge, surpassing both
generative and classifier-based LLM-Judge without requiring extra human
annotations.

multilingual, multi-domain, multi-generator dataset FAIDSet. We further
introduce a fine-grained detection framework FAID to classify text into these
three categories, meanwhile identifying the underlying AI model family. Unlike
existing binary classifiers, FAID is built to capture both authorship and
model-specific characteristics. Our method combines multi-level contrastive
learning with multi-task auxiliary classification to learn subtle stylistic
cues. By modeling AI families as distinct stylistic entities, FAID offers
improved interpretability. We incorporate an adaptation to address
distributional shifts without retraining for unseen data. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAID outperforms several baseline approaches, particularly
enhancing the generalization accuracy on unseen domains and new AI models. It

Abstract: Considering the importance of detecting hateful language, labeled hate speech
data is expensive and time-consuming to collect, particularly for low-resource
languages. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual
transfer learning and data augmentation in improving performance on tasks with
limited labeled data. To develop an efficient and scalable cross-lingual
transfer learning approach, we leverage nearest-neighbor retrieval to augment
minimal labeled data in the target language, thereby enhancing detection
performance. Specifically, we assume access to a small set of labeled training
instances in the target language and use these to retrieve the most relevant
labeled examples from a large multilingual hate speech detection pool. We
evaluate our approach on eight languages and demonstrate that it consistently
outperforms models trained solely on the target language data. Furthermore, in
most cases, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Notably, our
approach is highly data-efficient, retrieving as small as 200 instances in some
cases while maintaining superior performance. Moreover, it is scalable, as the
retrieval pool can be easily expanded, and the method can be readily adapted to
new languages and tasks. We also apply maximum marginal relevance to mitigate
redundancy and filter out highly similar retrieved instances, resulting in
improvements in some languages.

TL;DR: 本文研究了语音大语言模型（LLMs）对通用声学对抗攻击的脆弱性，揭示了其容易被特定音频段攻击的严重问题。

Motivation: 探讨语音LLMs在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，填补研究空白并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过预置固定的通用对抗音频段，研究模型对攻击的反应，包括无输出和任务覆盖，并扩展为选择性攻击。

Result: Qwen2-Audio和Granite-Speech模型在特定条件下易受攻击，揭示了语音LLMs的通用漏洞。

Conclusion: 语音LLMs需要更鲁棒的训练策略和对抗攻击防御方法。

Abstract: The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has
enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken
language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this
very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To
examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal
acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal,
adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We
initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output
or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend
the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when
specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are
present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing
fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical
vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar
speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This
highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance
to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为跨语言优化（CLO）的方法，用于高效地将英文为中心的大型语言模型迁移到目标语言，同时保持其英文能力。CLO通过利用公开的英文SFT数据和翻译模型实现跨语言迁移，并在多语言实验中表现优于传统SFT方法。

Motivation: 传统的监督微调（SFT）方法在将大型语言模型适配到其他语言时，往往过度依赖英文性能，尤其在数据受限的环境中表现不佳。本文旨在克服这一问题，提出一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出跨语言优化（CLO），利用公开的英文SFT数据和翻译模型进行跨语言迁移。实验使用了五种模型和六种不同资源水平的语言。

Result: CLO在多语言实验中表现优于SFT，尤其在低资源语言中仅需3200样本即可超越SFT的6400样本效果。此外，CLO对数据量的敏感度较低，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CLO通过高效利用数据，显著提升了模型在多语言环境中的性能，同时克服了SFT在数据敏感性和资源依赖上的局限性。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to other languages typically employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a standard approach. However, it often suffers
from an overemphasis on English performance, a phenomenon that is especially
pronounced in data-constrained environments. To overcome these challenges, we
propose \textbf{Cross-Lingual Optimization (CLO)} that efficiently transfers an
English-centric LLM to a target language while preserving its English
capabilities. CLO utilizes publicly available English SFT data and a
translation model to enable cross-lingual transfer. We conduct experiments
using five models on six languages, each possessing varying levels of resource.
Our results show that CLO consistently outperforms SFT in both acquiring target
language proficiency and maintaining English performance. Remarkably, in
low-resource languages, CLO with only 3,200 samples surpasses SFT with 6,400
samples, demonstrating that CLO can achieve better performance with less data.
Furthermore, we find that SFT is particularly sensitive to data quantity in
medium and low-resource languages, whereas CLO remains robust. Our
comprehensive analysis emphasizes the limitations of SFT and incorporates
additional training strategies in CLO to enhance efficiency.

Motivation: 传统监督微调方法在多阶段管道和对噪声模式信息的鲁棒性方面存在问题，JOLT-SQL旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: JOLT-SQL采用判别性模式链接和局部双向注意力增强，结合混淆感知噪声模式采样策略和选择性注意力，提升噪声模式下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在Spider和BIRD基准测试中，JOLT-SQL在可比较大小的开源模型中实现了最佳执行准确性，并显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: JOLT-SQL通过简化的单阶段框架和创新的模式链接策略，有效提升了任务性能和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which maps natural language to SQL queries, has benefited
greatly from recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs offer
various paradigms for this task, including prompting and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), SFT approaches still face challenges such as complex multi-stage
pipelines and poor robustness to noisy schema information. To address these
limitations, we present JOLT-SQL, a streamlined single-stage SFT framework that
jointly optimizes schema linking and SQL generation via a unified loss.
JOLT-SQL employs discriminative schema linking, enhanced by local bidirectional
attention, alongside a confusion-aware noisy schema sampling strategy with
selective attention to improve robustness under noisy schema conditions.
Experiments on the Spider and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate that JOLT-SQL
achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy among comparable-size open-source
models, while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: 检索增强的语言模型在减少计算资源的同时性能接近更大模型，但其效果依赖于查询与检索内容的匹配度。本文系统研究了不同匹配度对训练和推断性能的影响，发现超过关键阈值后性能显著提升。

Motivation: 探索查询-内容匹配度对检索增强语言模型的影响，以优化其性能。

Method: 通过实验研究不同匹配度的影响，并使用合成内容（如查询改写）增加匹配度。

Result: 增加匹配度超过阈值后显著降低困惑度并加速学习；合成内容可节省40%训练时间且不影响性能。

Conclusion: 优化检索机制可显著提升语言模型预训练效率与性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models have demonstrated performance comparable
to much larger models while requiring fewer computational resources. The
effectiveness of these models crucially depends on the overlap between query
and retrieved context, but the optimal degree of this overlap remains
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how varying levels of
query--context overlap affect model performance during both training and
inference. Our experiments reveal that increased overlap initially has minimal
effect, but substantially improves test-time perplexity and accelerates model
learning above a critical threshold. Building on these findings, we demonstrate
that deliberately increasing overlap through synthetic context can enhance data
efficiency and reduce training time by approximately 40\% without compromising
performance. We specifically generate synthetic context through paraphrasing
queries. We validate our perplexity-based findings on question-answering tasks,
confirming that the benefits of retrieval-augmented language modeling extend to
practical applications. Our results provide empirical evidence of significant
optimization potential for retrieval mechanisms in language model pretraining.

Abstract: Hausa Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained increasing attention in
recent years, yet remains understudied as a low-resource language despite
having over 120 million first-language (L1) and 80 million second-language (L2)

languages, Hausa NLP faces persistent challenges, including limited open-source
datasets and inadequate model representation. This paper presents an overview
of the current state of Hausa NLP, systematically examining existing resources,
research contributions, and gaps across fundamental NLP tasks: text
classification, machine translation, named entity recognition, speech
recognition, and question answering. We introduce HausaNLP
(https://catalog.hausanlp.org), a curated catalog that aggregates datasets,
tools, and research works to enhance accessibility and drive further
development. Furthermore, we discuss challenges in integrating Hausa into large
language models (LLMs), addressing issues of suboptimal tokenization and

emphasizing dataset expansion, improved language modeling approaches, and
strengthened community collaboration to advance Hausa NLP. Our work provides
both a foundation for accelerating Hausa NLP progress and valuable insights for

Conclusion: MIND为小型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的泛化能力提供了一种有效的解决方案，展示了其在低资源环境下的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on formal tasks,
where strong reasoning abilities define the state of the art. However, their
ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems remains limited. In this
paper, we investigate how LLMs can achieve a systematic understanding of
deductive rules. Our focus is on the task of identifying the appropriate subset
of premises within a knowledge base needed to derive a given hypothesis. To
tackle this challenge, we propose Meta-learning for In-context Deduction
(MIND), a novel few-shot meta-learning fine-tuning approach. The goal of MIND
is to enable models to generalize more effectively to unseen knowledge bases
and to systematically apply inference rules. Our results show that MIND
significantly improves generalization in small LMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B
parameters. The benefits are especially pronounced in smaller models and
low-data settings. Remarkably, small models fine-tuned with MIND outperform
state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and o3-mini, on this task.

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上实验，ROUGE得分提升高达29%。

Conclusion: QA-prompting是一种高效且可扩展的摘要解决方案，强调了领域特定问题选择的重要性。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
enabling high-quality text generation through prompting and in-context
learning. However, models often struggle with long-context summarization due to
positional biases, leading to suboptimal extraction of critical information.
There are techniques to improve this with fine-tuning, pipelining, or using
complex techniques, which have their own challenges. To solve these challenges,
we propose QA-prompting - a simple prompting method for summarization that
utilizes question-answering as an intermediate step prior to summary
generation. Our method extracts key information and enriches the context of
text to mitigate positional biases and improve summarization in a single LM
call per task without requiring fine-tuning or pipelining. Experiments on
multiple datasets belonging to different domains using ten state-of-the-art
pre-trained models demonstrate that QA-prompting outperforms baseline and other
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 29% improvement in ROUGE scores. This
provides an effective and scalable solution for summarization and highlights
the importance of domain-specific question selection for optimal performance.

Conclusion: 联合训练奇异值和输出维度向量对性能至关重要，OSoRA是高效的微调方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
due to their massive scale and associated computational costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methodologies have been proposed as
computational alternatives; however, their implementations still require
significant resources. In this paper, we present OSoRA (Output-Dimension and
Singular-Value Initialized Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method for LLMs.
OSoRA extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by integrating Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) with learnable scaling vectors in a unified framework. It
first performs an SVD of pre-trained weight matrices, then optimizes an
output-dimension vector during training, while keeping the corresponding
singular vector matrices frozen. OSoRA substantially reduces computational
resource requirements by minimizing the number of trainable parameters during
fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, common
sense reasoning, and other benchmarks demonstrate that OSoRA achieves
comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA and
VeRA, while maintaining a linear parameter scaling even as the rank increases
to higher dimensions. Our ablation studies further confirm that jointly
training both the singular values and the output-dimension vector is critical
for optimal performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a broad
array of tasks, yet their capacity for complex, domain-specific mathematical
reasoning-particularly in wireless communications-remains underexplored. In
this work, we introduce WirelessMathBench, a novel benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate LLMs on mathematical modeling challenges to wireless
communications engineering. Our benchmark consists of 587 meticulously curated
questions sourced from 40 state-of-the-art research papers, encompassing a
diverse spectrum of tasks ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to
complex equation completion tasks, including both partial and full completions,
all of which rigorously adhere to physical and dimensional constraints. Through
extensive experimentation with leading LLMs, we observe that while many models
excel in basic recall tasks, their performance degrades significantly when
reconstructing partially or fully obscured equations, exposing fundamental
limitations in current LLMs. Even DeepSeek-R1, the best performer on our
benchmark, achieves an average accuracy of only 38.05%, with a mere 7.83%
success rate in full equation completion. By publicly releasing
WirelessMathBench along with the evaluation toolkit, we aim to advance the
development of more robust, domain-aware LLMs for wireless system analysis and
broader engineering applications.

Conclusion: DuDe通过分解策略优化了训练稳定性和知识保留，为LLM的高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical paradigm for
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, among which Low-rank
Adaptation (LoRA) represents one of the most widely adopted methodologies.
However, existing LoRA-based approaches exhibit two fundamental limitations:
unstable training dynamics and inefficient knowledge transfer from pre-trained
models, both stemming from random initialization of adapter parameters. To
overcome these challenges, we propose DuDe, a novel approach that decomposes
weight matrices into magnitude and direction components, employing Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) for principled initialization. Our comprehensive
evaluation demonstrates DuDe's superior performance and robustness, achieving
up to 48.35\% accuracy on MMLU and 62.53\% ($\pm$ 1.59) accuracy on GSM8K. Our
theoretical analysis and empirical validation collectively demonstrate that
DuDe's decomposition strategy enhances optimization stability and better
preserves pre-trained representations, particularly for domain-specific tasks
requiring specialized knowledge. The combination of robust empirical
performance and rigorous theoretical foundations establishes DuDe as a
significant contribution to PEFT methodologies for LLMs.

Abstract: Generating a review for an academic research paper is a complex task that
requires a deep understanding of the document's content and the
interdependencies between its sections. It demands not only insight into
technical details but also an appreciation of the paper's overall coherence and
structure. Recent methods have predominantly focused on fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. However, they often overlook
the computational and performance limitations imposed by long input token
lengths. To address this, we introduce AutoRev, an Automatic Peer Review System
for Academic Research Papers. Our novel framework represents an academic
document as a graph, enabling the extraction of the most critical passages that
contribute significantly to the review. This graph-based approach demonstrates
effectiveness for review generation and is potentially adaptable to various
downstream tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and document
representation. When applied to review generation, our method outperforms SOTA
baselines by an average of 58.72% across all evaluation metrics. We hope that
our work will stimulate further research in applying graph-based extraction
techniques to other downstream tasks in NLP. We plan to make our code public
upon acceptance.

Abstract: Evaluating text generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is
challenging, particularly for low-resource languages where methods for direct
assessment are scarce. We propose MUG-Eval, a novel framework that evaluates
LLMs' multilingual generation capabilities by transforming existing benchmarks
into conversational tasks and measuring the LLMs' accuracies on those tasks. We
specifically designed these conversational tasks to require effective
communication in the target language. Then, we simply use task success rate as
a proxy of successful conversation generation. Our approach offers two key
advantages: it is independent of language-specific NLP tools or annotated
datasets, which are limited for most languages, and it does not rely on
LLMs-as-judges, whose evaluation quality degrades outside a few high-resource
languages. We evaluate 8 LLMs across 30 languages spanning high, mid, and
low-resource categories, and we find that MUG-Eval correlates strongly with
established benchmarks ($r$ > 0.75) while enabling standardized comparisons
across languages and models. Our framework provides a robust and
resource-efficient solution for evaluating multilingual generation that can be
extended to thousands of languages.

Method: 设计了基于键值（KV）缓存的日志增强生成（LAG）框架，复用过去的推理上下文，仅存储关键令牌的KV缓存，在遇到新任务时检索相关日志以增强生成。

Conclusion: LAG通过直接复用以往推理和计算，提升了模型在新任务中的表现，且具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While humans naturally learn and adapt from past experiences, large language
models (LLMs) and their agentic counterparts struggle to retain reasoning from
previous tasks and apply them in future contexts. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel framework, log-augmented generation (LAG) that directly
reuses prior computation and reasoning from past logs at test time to enhance
model's ability to learn from previous tasks and perform better on new, unseen
challenges, all while keeping the system efficient and scalable. Specifically,
our system represents task logs using key-value (KV) caches, encoding the full
reasoning context of prior tasks while storing KV caches for only a selected
subset of tokens. When a new task arises, LAG retrieves the KV values from
relevant logs to augment generation. Our approach differs from reflection-based
memory mechanisms by directly reusing prior reasoning and computations without
requiring additional steps for knowledge extraction or distillation. Our method
also goes beyond existing KV caching techniques, which primarily target
efficiency gains rather than improving accuracy. Experiments on knowledge- and
reasoning-intensive datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms standard agentic systems that do not utilize logs, as well as
existing solutions based on reflection and KV cache techniques.

Method: 提出PhantomCircuit框架，运用知识路径分析，剖析注意力头的内部机制，追踪知识遮蔽现象的演变。

Conclusion: PhantomCircuit为知识遮蔽现象提供了深入分析工具，有助于未来缓解此类问题的方法开发。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are
hampered by hallucinations. A particularly challenging variant, knowledge
overshadowing, occurs when one piece of activated knowledge inadvertently masks
another relevant piece, leading to erroneous outputs even with high-quality
training data. Current understanding of overshadowing is largely confined to
inference-time observations, lacking deep insights into its origins and
internal mechanisms during model training. Therefore, we introduce
PhantomCircuit, a novel framework designed to comprehensively analyze and
detect knowledge overshadowing. By innovatively employing knowledge circuit
analysis, PhantomCircuit dissects the internal workings of attention heads,
tracing how competing knowledge pathways contribute to the overshadowing
phenomenon and its evolution throughout the training process. Extensive
experiments demonstrate PhantomCircuit's effectiveness in identifying such
instances, offering novel insights into this elusive hallucination and
providing the research community with a new methodological lens for its

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了MLLM-powered GUI代理在交互层面暴露的多种触发器，并提出了AgentGhost框架，通过复合触发器和Min-Max优化实现高效且隐蔽的后门攻击。

Motivation: 由于开源GUI代理或API的使用存在后门攻击的供应链威胁，而目前相关研究不足，因此需要探索和防御此类攻击。

Method: AgentGhost框架结合目标和交互级触发器，通过Min-Max优化和对比学习改进后门的灵活性与隐蔽性。

Result: 实验证明AgentGhost在多个代理模型中攻击准确率高达99.7%，且仅导致1%的效用下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为GUI代理的后门攻击提供了新的视角，并提出了有效的防御方法，将攻击准确率降至22.1%。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due
to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or
APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored
supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that
MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers,
such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this
observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for
red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite
triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to
unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we
formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses
supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across
sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the
backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the
discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing
effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two
established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic,
with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows
stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a
defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

TL;DR: 提出了SAE-FiRE框架，利用稀疏自动编码器提取财务信号，显著优于基线方法。

Motivation: 通过分析财报电话会议记录预测盈利惊喜，但现有记录冗长冗余，行业术语多，语言模型难处理。

Method: 使用稀疏自动编码器(SAEs)提取关键信息，过滤噪音，捕捉预测盈利惊喜的财务信号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SAE-FiRE框架能有效解决财报记录分析的挑战，提升预测能力。

Abstract: Predicting earnings surprises through the analysis of earnings conference
call transcripts has attracted increasing attention from the financial research
community. Conference calls serve as critical communication channels between
company executives, analysts, and shareholders, offering valuable
forward-looking information. However, these transcripts present significant
analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial
redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for
language models. In this work, we propose the Sparse Autoencoder for Financial
Representation Enhancement (SAE-FiRE) framework to address these limitations by
extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to efficiently identify patterns and filter out
noises, and focusing specifically on capturing nuanced financial signals that
have predictive power for earnings surprises. Experimental results indicate
that the proposed method can significantly outperform comparing baselines.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance
on a variety of tasks; however, generalizing from synthetic to human-authored
instructions in grounded environments remains a challenge for them. In this
work, we study generalization challenges in spatial grounding tasks where
models interpret and translate instructions for building object arrangements on
a $2.5$D grid. We fine-tune LLMs using only synthetic instructions and evaluate
their performance on a benchmark dataset containing both synthetic and
human-written instructions. Our results reveal that while models generalize
well on simple tasks, their performance degrades significantly on more complex
tasks. We present a detailed error analysis of the gaps in instruction
generalization.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了通过参数实现跨规模大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识迁移（PKT），并提出了PrePKT和PostPKT两种范式，以及名为LaTen的解决方案，揭示了神经不兼容性（Neural Incompatibility）是主要挑战。

Motivation: 传统基于符号语言的知识迁移方法限制了效率，研究者希望探索通过参数直接迁移知识的新途径，尤其是针对不同规模的LLMs。

Method: 提出了PrePKT（预对齐PKT）范式和LaTen方法，利用少量训练步骤对齐参数空间，避免了后续微调。

Result: 实验表明，PrePKT和PostPKT在跨规模PKT中均面临稳定性问题，神经不兼容性是核心挑战。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs参数结构的复杂性，为未来高效PKT研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transparent brain with accessible
parameters that encode extensive knowledge, which can be analyzed, located and
transferred. Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional
knowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine
Parametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods
for transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters
presents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first
demonstrate $\textbf{Alignment}$ in parametric space is the fundamental
prerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously
explored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes
extracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune
for alignment. Hence, to reduce cost for further fine-tuning, we introduce a
novel Pre-Align PKT (PrePKT) paradigm and propose a solution called
$\textbf{LaTen}$
($\textbf{L}$oc$\textbf{a}$te-$\textbf{T}$h$\textbf{e}$n-Alig$\textbf{n}$) that
aligns the parametric spaces of LLMs across scales only using several training
steps without following training. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks
demonstrate that both PostPKT and PrePKT face challenges in achieving
consistently stable transfer. Through in-depth analysis, we identify
$\textbf{Neural Incompatibility}$ as the ethological and parametric structural
differences between LLMs of varying scales, presenting fundamental challenges
to achieving effective PKT. These findings provide fresh insights into the
parametric architectures of LLMs and highlight promising directions for future
research on efficient PKT. Our code is available at

Motivation: 虽然LLM在自然语言生成任务中表现出色，但其生成真正创造性内容的能力有限。现有方法多集中于单一维度，未能全面解决创造力的多面性。

Method: 提出了Creative Preference Optimization (CrPO)方法，将多个创造力维度的信号模块化地注入偏好优化目标中，并使用了新的数据集MuCE进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用CrPO的模型在自动和人类评估中均优于强基线（如GPT-4o），生成的内容更具新颖性、多样性和惊喜性，同时保持高质量。

Conclusion: 在偏好框架内直接优化创造力是提升LLM创造性能力的有前景方向。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across natural language generation tasks, their ability to generate truly
creative content-characterized by novelty, diversity, surprise, and
quality-remains limited. Existing methods for enhancing LLM creativity often
focus narrowly on diversity or specific tasks, failing to address creativity's
multifaceted nature in a generalizable way. In this work, we propose Creative
Preference Optimization (CrPO), a novel alignment method that injects signals
from multiple creativity dimensions into the preference optimization objective
in a modular fashion. We train and evaluate creativity-augmented versions of
several models using CrPO and MuCE, a new large-scale human preference dataset
spanning over 200,000 human-generated responses and ratings from more than 30
psychological creativity assessments. Our models outperform strong baselines,
including GPT-4o, on both automated and human evaluations, producing more
novel, diverse, and surprising generations while maintaining high output
quality. Additional evaluations on NoveltyBench further confirm the
generalizability of our approach. Together, our results demonstrate that
directly optimizing for creativity within preference frameworks is a promising
direction for advancing the creative capabilities of LLMs without compromising
output quality.

Conclusion: CtrlDiff通过动态块大小和分类器引导控制，提升了扩散语言模型的性能和可控性。

Abstract: Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent
years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to
the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language
models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel
generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are
often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to
combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,
modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete
diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the
preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered
by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible
control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed
granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language
models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive
framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on
local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a
classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which
significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient
post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the
performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables
effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Distillation has emerged as a practical and effective approach to enhance the

a large-scale empirical study on reasoning data distillation by collecting
verified outputs from three state-of-the-art teacher models-AM-Thinking-v1,
Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-R1-on a shared corpus of 1.89 million queries. We

lower perplexity. Student models trained on each dataset are evaluated on

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种非训练且无需参数的L2自适应计算（LAC）方法，用于检测推断过程中未激活的层（称为“Voids”），并通过实验证明选择性跳过这些层可以提高模型性能。

Motivation: 研究动机在于探究基于transformer的语言模型在推断过程中是否所有层都被激活，以及未激活层对模型性能的影响。

Method: 采用L2自适应计算（LAC）方法，通过监控激活的L2范数变化来识别未激活层（Voids），并在指令调优的语言模型中分析提示处理和响应生成两个阶段的层激活情况。

Result: 实验结果表明，在MMLU和GPQA Diamond等基准测试中，跳过未激活层可以显著提高模型性能（如Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct在MMLU上的准确率从69.24提升到71.29）。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，模型推断过程中并非所有层都同等重要，选择性跳过未激活层可以提高模型效率和性能。

Abstract: Despite advances in transformer-based language models (LMs), a fundamental
question remains largely unanswered: Are all layers activated during inference?
We investigate this question by detecting unactivated layers (which we refer to
as Voids) using a non-trainable and parameter-free adaptive computation method
called L2 Adaptive Computation (LAC). We adapt LAC from its original
efficiency-focused application to trace activated layers during inference. This
method monitors changes in the L2-norm of activations to identify voids. We
analyze layer activation in instruction-tuned LMs across two phases: Prompt
Processing (PP), where we trace activated layers for each token in the input
prompts, and Response Generation (RG), where we trace activated layers for each
generated token. We further demonstrate that distinct layers are activated
during these two phases. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated
three distinct instruction-tuned LMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families
on three benchmarks: MMLU, GPQA Diamond, and BoolQ. For example, on MMLU with a
zero-shot setting, skipping voids in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct resulted in an
improvement from 69.24 to 71.29 while the model uses only 30% of the layers.
Similarly, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 on GPQA Diamond improved from 13.88 to
18.36 when using 70% of the layers during both the PP and RG phases. These
results show that not all layers contribute equally during inference, and that
selectively skipping most of them can improve the performance of models on
certain tasks.

Abstract: Citation classification, which identifies the intention behind academic
citations, is pivotal for scholarly analysis. Previous works suggest
fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on citation classification
datasets, reaping the reward of the linguistic knowledge they gained during
pretraining. However, directly fine-tuning for citation classification is
challenging due to labeled data scarcity, contextual noise, and spurious
keyphrase correlations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Citss,
that adapts the PLMs to overcome these challenges. Citss introduces
self-supervised contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, and is
equipped with two specialized strategies to obtain the contrastive pairs:
sentence-level cropping, which enhances focus on target citations within long
contexts, and keyphrase perturbation, which mitigates reliance on specific
keyphrases. Compared with previous works that are only designed for
encoder-based PLMs, Citss is carefully developed to be compatible with both
encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs, to embrace the benefits of enlarged
pretraining. Experiments with three benchmark datasets with both encoder-based
PLMs and decoder-based LLMs demonstrate our superiority compared to the
previous state of the art. Our code is available at: github.com/LITONG99/Citss

Abstract: In the field of urban planning, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
frequently fail to effectively analyze and evaluate planning maps, despite the
critical importance of these visual elements for urban planners and related
educational contexts. Planning maps, which visualize land use, infrastructure
layouts, and functional zoning, require specialized understanding of spatial
configurations, regulatory requirements, and multi-scale analysis. To address
this challenge, we introduce PlanGPT-VL, the first domain-specific
Vision-Language Model tailored specifically for urban planning maps. PlanGPT-VL
employs three innovative approaches: (1) PlanAnno-V framework for high-quality
VQA data synthesis, (2) Critical Point Thinking to reduce hallucinations
through structured verification, and (3) comprehensive training methodology
combining Supervised Fine-Tuning with frozen vision encoder parameters. Through
systematic evaluation on our proposed PlanBench-V benchmark, we demonstrate
that PlanGPT-VL significantly outperforms general-purpose state-of-the-art VLMs
in specialized planning map interpretation tasks, offering urban planning
professionals a reliable tool for map analysis, assessment, and educational
applications while maintaining high factual accuracy. Our lightweight 7B
parameter model achieves comparable performance to models exceeding 72B
parameters, demonstrating efficient domain specialization without sacrificing

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in flagging harmful
content in online communities. Yet, existing approaches for moderation require
a separate model for every community and are opaque in their decision-making,
limiting real-world adoption. We introduce Mixture of Moderation Experts
(MoMoE), a modular, cross-community framework that adds post-hoc explanations
to scalable content moderation. MoMoE orchestrates four operators -- Allocate,
Predict, Aggregate, Explain -- and is instantiated as seven
community-specialized experts (MoMoE-Community) and five norm-violation experts
(MoMoE-NormVio). On 30 unseen subreddits, the best variants obtain Micro-F1
scores of 0.72 and 0.67, respectively, matching or surpassing strong fine-tuned
baselines while consistently producing concise and reliable explanations.
Although community-specialized experts deliver the highest peak accuracy,
norm-violation experts provide steadier performance across domains. These
findings show that MoMoE yields scalable, transparent moderation without
needing per-community fine-tuning. More broadly, they suggest that lightweight,
explainable expert ensembles can guide future NLP and HCI research on
trustworthy human-AI governance of online communities.

Conclusion: LRSA框架有效结合SLMs与LLMs的优势，显著提升MABSA任务的性能，证明其普适性和实用性。

Abstract: There has been growing interest in Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
(MABSA) in recent years. Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained
small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and
sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities.
However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in
inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their
interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language
models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by
effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However,
some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small
models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel
framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs
with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject
explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual
cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby
augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated
our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the
superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its
generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.

Result: 通过实验发现，预训练权重对模型理解多模态信号至关重要，ModRWKV在性能和效率上达到平衡。

Conclusion: 现代RNN架构在多模态大语言模型中是Transformer的可行替代方案，并找到了ModRWKV的最佳配置。

Abstract: Currently, most multimodal studies are based on large language models (LLMs)
with quadratic-complexity Transformer architectures. While linear models like
RNNs enjoy low inference costs, their application has been largely limited to
the text-only modality. This work explores the capabilities of modern RNN
architectures in multimodal contexts. We propose ModRWKV-a decoupled multimodal
framework built upon the RWKV7 architecture as its LLM backbone-which achieves
multi-source information fusion through dynamically adaptable heterogeneous
modality encoders. We designed the multimodal modules in ModRWKV with an
extremely lightweight architecture and, through extensive experiments,
identified a configuration that achieves an optimal balance between performance
and computational efficiency. ModRWKV leverages the pretrained weights of the
RWKV7 LLM for initialization, which significantly accelerates multimodal
training. Comparative experiments with different pretrained checkpoints further
demonstrate that such initialization plays a crucial role in enhancing the
model's ability to understand multimodal signals. Supported by extensive
experiments, we conclude that modern RNN architectures present a viable
alternative to Transformers in the domain of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Furthermore, we identify the optimal configuration of the ModRWKV
architecture through systematic exploration.

TL;DR: 论文提出语言模型在逻辑形式上（LFLMs）的数据效率优于文本模型，并通过GFoLDS原型验证了其可行性。

Motivation: 探讨逻辑形式语言模型（LFLMs）在数据效率上的优势。

Method: 引入基于图的逻辑分布语义（GFoLDS）原型，预训练逻辑形式的图表示模型。

Result: 实验表明LFLMs能快速学习复杂模式，并在少量数据下优于文本模型。

Conclusion: LFLMs具有实际应用潜力，性能随参数和数据增加而提升。

Abstract: We make the case for language models over logical forms (LFLMs), arguing that
such models are more data-efficient than their textual counterparts. To that
end, we introduce the Graph-based Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics
(GFoLDS) prototype, a pretrained LM over graph representations of logical
forms, as a proof-of-concept of LFLMs. Using GFoLDS, we present strong
experimental evidence that LFLMs can leverage the built-in, basic linguistic
knowledge inherent in such models to immediately begin learning more complex
patterns. On downstream tasks, we show that GFoLDS vastly outperforms textual,
transformer LMs pretrained on similar amounts of data, indicating that LFLMs
can learn with substantially less data than models over plain text.
Furthermore, we show that the performance of this model is likely to scale with
additional parameters and pretraining data, suggesting the viability of LFLMs
in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通过内部链式思维（internal chain-of-thought）逐层分解和执行复合任务，证明了其在网络深度中学习并顺序执行子任务的能力。

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示LLMs如何内部规划和执行复合任务，增强模型透明度，为指令级激活引导提供基础。

Method: 通过层间上下文掩码和新颖的跨任务修补方法验证子任务在不同网络深度的学习；利用LogitLens解码隐藏状态，分析层间执行模式。

Result: 在15个两步复合任务基准和真实TRACE基准上，观察到一致的逐层执行动态，证实LLMs能够顺序执行子任务。

Conclusion: LLMs具备内部规划和逐层执行子任务的能力，为模型透明性和指令级控制提供了新视角。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit an $\textit{internal
chain-of-thought}$: they sequentially decompose and execute composite tasks
layer-by-layer. Two claims ground our study: (i) distinct subtasks are learned
at different network depths, and (ii) these subtasks are executed sequentially
across layers. On a benchmark of 15 two-step composite tasks, we employ
layer-from context-masking and propose a novel cross-task patching method,
confirming (i). To examine claim (ii), we apply LogitLens to decode hidden
states, revealing a consistent layerwise execution pattern. We further
replicate our analysis on the real-world $\text{TRACE}$ benchmark, observing
the same stepwise dynamics. Together, our results enhance LLMs transparency by
showing their capacity to internally plan and execute subtasks (or
instructions), opening avenues for fine-grained, instruction-level activation
steering.

TL;DR: 本文利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）识别语言模型中的毒性方向，并通过激活引导减少毒性输出，在毒性降低和语言流畅性之间取得平衡。

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其仍可能生成有毒内容，现有方法容易被绕过，因此需要更有效的解毒方法。

Method: 使用SAEs识别毒性相关方向，并通过三个级别的激活引导强度进行干预，评估了GPT-2 Small和Gemma-2-2B模型的表现。

Result: 强引导下毒性降低高达20%，但语言流畅性可能下降；标准NLP基准分数保持稳定，SAEs的特征分离会影响安全性干预。

Conclusion: SAE基于的因果干预在解毒方面有潜力，但也存在局限性，为安全部署提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications,
yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity,
vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods
exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be
circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual
stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the
corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering
aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing
trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger
steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in
reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2
Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores
upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general
abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs
hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled
feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further
suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

Motivation: 现有评估方法多为领域专用，无法全面捕捉LLM的通用推理能力，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入KORGym平台，包含50多种游戏（文本或视觉形式），支持交互式多轮评估和强化学习场景，对19个LLM和8个VLM进行实验。

Result: 发现模型家族内一致的推理模式，闭源模型表现更优，并分析了模态、推理策略、强化学习和响应长度对性能的影响。

Conclusion: KORGym有望成为推动LLM推理研究和开发复杂交互环境评估方法的重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
more comprehensive evaluation methods to accurately assess their reasoning
capabilities. Existing benchmarks are often domain-specific and thus cannot
fully capture an LLM's general reasoning potential. To address this limitation,
we introduce the Knowledge Orthogonal Reasoning Gymnasium (KORGym), a dynamic
evaluation platform inspired by KOR-Bench and Gymnasium. KORGym offers over
fifty games in either textual or visual formats and supports interactive,
multi-turn assessments with reinforcement learning scenarios. Using KORGym, we
conduct extensive experiments on 19 LLMs and 8 VLMs, revealing consistent
reasoning patterns within model families and demonstrating the superior
performance of closed-source models. Further analysis examines the effects of
modality, reasoning strategies, reinforcement learning techniques, and response
length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for
advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited
to complex, interactive environments.

Motivation: 缺乏大规模、多样化领域的平行语料库导致某些语言对的翻译困难，因此探索使用中介语言的解决方案。

Method: 采用印地语作为中介语言，并测试了两种方法：转移方法（全监督）和反向翻译（半监督）。

Result: 转移方法在开发测试集上达到SacreBLEU分数14.2，比基线全监督方法提升了6.6分，但略低于半监督基线分数15.1。

Conclusion: 印地语是一种有效的中介语言，未来可进一步优化半监督方法的性能。

Abstract: Certain pairs of languages suffer from lack of a parallel corpus which is
large in size and diverse in domain. One of the ways this is overcome is via
use of a pivot language. In this paper we use Hindi as a pivot language to
translate Nepali into English. We describe what makes Hindi a good candidate
for the pivot. We discuss ways in which a pivot language can be used, and use
two such approaches - the Transfer Method (fully supervised) and
Backtranslation (semi-supervised) - to translate Nepali into English. Using the
former, we are able to achieve a devtest Set SacreBLEU score of 14.2, which
improves the baseline fully supervised score reported by (Guzman et al., 2019)
by 6.6 points. While we are slightly below the semi-supervised baseline score
of 15.1, we discuss what may have caused this under-performance, and suggest

Method: 利用LLM基于评分标准生成特质特定特征，结合通用和提示特定特征训练回归模型。

Result: TRATES在广泛使用的数据集上对所有特质都达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: LLM生成的特征最为显著，证明了框架的有效性。

Abstract: Research on holistic Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is long-dated; yet, there
is a notable lack of attention for assessing essays according to individual
traits. In this work, we propose TRATES, a novel trait-specific and
rubric-based cross-prompt AES framework that is generic yet specific to the
underlying trait. The framework leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) that
utilizes the trait grading rubrics to generate trait-specific features
(represented by assessment questions), then assesses those features given an
essay. The trait-specific features are eventually combined with generic
writing-quality and prompt-specific features to train a simple classical
regression model that predicts trait scores of essays from an unseen prompt.
Experiments show that TRATES achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across
all traits on a widely-used dataset, with the generated LLM-based features
being the most significant.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过逻辑图剪枝优化长链推理（Long-CoT）的方法，命名为Prune-on-Logic，用于提升小语言模型（SLMs）的推理能力。实验表明，剪枝验证步骤能提高准确性并降低推理成本，而剪枝推理或整体链步骤会降低性能。

Motivation: 长链推理（Long-CoT）虽然能提升大语言模型的准确性，但其冗长的自反思风格难以有效压缩至小模型（SLMs）。论文通过能力对齐视角，探索剪枝是否能优化推理能力。

Method: 提出Prune-on-Logic框架，将Long-CoT转化为逻辑图，并在自验证约束下选择性剪枝低效推理步骤。研究了针对整体链、核心推理和验证的三种剪枝策略。

Result: 剪枝验证步骤能带来准确性增益并降低成本，优于未压缩的基线；而剪枝推理或整体链步骤会降低性能，表明小模型需要的是语义更简洁而非更短的推理链。

Conclusion: 剪枝是一种结构优化策略，能有效对齐CoT推理与小模型的能力，提升性能。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning improves accuracy in LLMs, yet its
verbose, self-reflective style often hinders effective distillation into small
language models (SLMs). We revisit Long-CoT compression through the lens of
capability alignment and ask: Can pruning improve reasoning? We propose
Prune-on-Logic, a structure-aware framework that transforms Long-CoT into logic
graphs and selectively prunes low-utility reasoning steps under
self-verification constraints. Through systematic analysis across three pruning
strategies -- targeting entire chains, core reasoning, and verification -- we
find that pruning verification steps yields consistent accuracy gains while
reducing inference cost, outperforming token-level baselines and uncompressed
fine-tuning. In contrast, pruning reasoning or all-chain steps degrades
performance, revealing that small models benefit not from shorter CoTs, but
from semantically leaner ones. Our findings highlight pruning as a structural
optimization strategy for aligning CoT reasoning with SLM capacity.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在安全性和隐私保护方面存在不足，且现有方法依赖敏感模式匹配，忽略了法律合规性。

Method: 采用上下文完整性理论框架，结合强化学习和规则奖励，提升模型对GDPR、EU AI Act和HIPAA标准的合规性。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著提升了法律合规性（安全/隐私基准准确率提升17.64%），并进一步增强了推理能力（MMLU和LegalBench基准分别提升2.05%和8.98%）。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了安全性和隐私问题，还提升了模型的通用推理能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also
introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies
often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios.
Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which
limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy
standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these
gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance
problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI
framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR,
EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with
a rule-based reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while
enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances
legal compliance (achieving a +17.64% accuracy improvement in safety/privacy
benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability. For
OpenThinker-7B, a strong reasoning model that significantly outperforms its
base model Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct across diverse subjects, our method enhances its
general reasoning capabilities, with +2.05% and +8.98% accuracy improvement on
the MMLU and LegalBench benchmark, respectively.

Motivation: MCP的分散架构引入未充分探索的安全风险，需要系统性安全分析。

Method: 基于MAESTRO框架分析MCP的安全漏洞，提出MCIP协议，开发细粒度分类法和基准数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明LLMs在MCP交互中存在漏洞，提出的方法显著提升其安全性。

Conclusion: MCIP框架和分类法有效增强了MCP交互的安全性。

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users
and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized
architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for
systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance
MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing
safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model
Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses
these gaps.Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse
range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy,
we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and
improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP
interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct
extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs'
vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves their safety performance.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了代码敏感性（Code Sensitivity）的概念，提出了CTF-Code基准和CTF-Instruct微调框架，以提高LLMs对代码细节变化的识别能力。

Motivation: 当前代码基准和指令数据主要关注难度和多样性，忽视了代码敏感性，即LLMs对问题描述细节变化的识别与响应能力。这限制了模型在实际场景中的应用效果。

Method: 通过构造CTF-Code基准（基于反事实扰动）和CTF-Instruct微调框架，从难度、多样性和敏感性三个维度优化LLMs。微调框架通过增量指令和数据选择机制实现。

Result: 实验显示，使用CTF-Instruct微调的LLMs在CTF-Code上提升超过2%，在LiveCodeBench上性能提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 增强LLMs的代码敏感性可以显著提升其性能，验证了敏感性作为代码理解重要维度的可行性。

Abstract: Code Sensitivity refers to the ability of Code LLMs to recognize and respond
to details changes in problem descriptions. While current code benchmarks and
instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked.
We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual
perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The
evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared
to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an
incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and
uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty,
diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with
CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a
10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of
enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.

Conclusion: TruthHypo和KnowHD为评估LLMs生成真实假设的能力提供了有效工具，有助于加速科学发现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific
disciplines such as biomedicine, particularly in hypothesis generation, where
they can analyze vast literature, identify patterns, and suggest research
directions. However, a key challenge lies in evaluating the truthfulness of
generated hypotheses, as verifying their accuracy often requires substantial
time and resources. Additionally, the hallucination problem in LLMs can lead to
the generation of hypotheses that appear plausible but are ultimately
incorrect, undermining their reliability. To facilitate the systematic study of
these challenges, we introduce TruthHypo, a benchmark for assessing the
capabilities of LLMs in generating truthful biomedical hypotheses, and KnowHD,
a knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are
grounded in existing knowledge. Our results show that LLMs struggle to generate
truthful hypotheses. By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we
demonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an
effective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of
LLMs. Human evaluations further validate the utility of KnowHD in identifying
truthful hypotheses and accelerating scientific discovery. Our data and source
code are available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/TruthHypo.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高了对齐性、泛化能力和抗攻击性。

Conclusion: sudoLLM作为补充安全层，增强了LLM端到端的安全性。

Abstract: User authorization-based access privileges are a key feature in many
safety-critical systems, but have thus far been absent from the large language
model (LLM) realm. In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control
systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role
aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user
access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains
an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if
and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating
that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, and
resistance to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks. The persistent tension between
the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited
to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias
signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements
existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究结论强调了机器文本检测的不可靠性，建议避免依赖此类检测方法。

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors,
it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that
stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text
cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et
al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to
degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not
specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space$\unicode{x2013}$the
stylistic feature space$\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization,
and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models
optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are
explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains
surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are
inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing
approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and
machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using
traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for
detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors
considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of
samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions
become distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a
metric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated
distributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples
become available. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to
avoid reliance on machine-text detection.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在评估时表现出的‘测试意识’如何影响其行为，特别是安全对齐问题。

Method: 提出白盒探测框架：(i) 线性识别与测试意识相关的激活，(ii) 控制模型朝向或远离测试意识，同时监测下游性能。应用于多个领先的开源推理LLMs。

Result: 测试意识显著影响安全对齐，且不同模型表现不同。

Conclusion: 通过精细控制测试意识，研究旨在提升安全评估的可信度。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) sometimes alter their behavior
when they detect that they are being evaluated, an effect analogous to the
Hawthorne phenomenon, which can lead them to optimize for test-passing
performance or to comply more readily with harmful prompts if real-world
consequences appear absent. We present the first quantitative study of how such
"test awareness" impacts model behavior, particularly its safety alignment. We
introduce a white-box probing framework that (i) linearly identifies
awareness-related activations and (ii) steers models toward or away from test
awareness while monitoring downstream performance. We apply our method to
different state-of-the-art open-source reasoning LLMs across both realistic and
hypothetical tasks. Our results demonstrate that test awareness significantly
impact safety alignment, and is different for different models. By providing
fine-grained control over this latent effect, our work aims to increase trust
in how we perform safety evaluation.

Result: LHRMs在不同难度和类型的查询上自适应进行混合思考，性能优于现有LRMs和LLMs，同时显著提高效率。

Conclusion: LHRMs为混合思考系统的构建提供了基础，并重新思考了扩展思考过程的适用性。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown substantially improved
reasoning capabilities over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating extended thinking processes prior to producing final responses.
However, excessively lengthy thinking introduces substantial overhead in terms
of token consumption and latency, which is particularly unnecessary for simple
queries. In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the
first kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform
thinking based on the contextual information of user queries. To achieve this,
we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as
a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed
Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the
appropriate thinking mode. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called Hybrid
Accuracy to quantitatively assess the model's capability for hybrid thinking.
Extensive experimental results show that LHRMs can adaptively perform hybrid
thinking on queries of varying difficulty and type. It outperforms existing
LRMs and LLMs in reasoning and general capabilities while significantly
improving efficiency. Together, our work advocates for a reconsideration of the
appropriate use of extended thinking processes and provides a solid starting
point for building hybrid thinking systems.

TL;DR: 通过揭示AI模型的价值优先级，LitmusValues和AIRiskDilemmas可以预测潜在风险行为。

Motivation: 随着AI模型能力增强，检测其风险行为变得更具挑战性。作者希望通过识别模型的内在价值，作为预警机制。

Method: 开发LitmusValues评估管道和AIRiskDilemmas数据集，通过模型的价值观测其风险行为。

Result: 模型的价值优先级（包括看似无害的）可以预测已知和未知风险行为。

Conclusion: 价值观测是识别AI潜在风险的有效方法。

Abstract: Detecting AI risks becomes more challenging as stronger models emerge and
find novel methods such as Alignment Faking to circumvent these detection
attempts. Inspired by how risky behaviors in humans (i.e., illegal activities
that may hurt others) are sometimes guided by strongly-held values, we believe
that identifying values within AI models can be an early warning system for
AI's risky behaviors. We create LitmusValues, an evaluation pipeline to reveal
AI models' priorities on a range of AI value classes. Then, we collect
AIRiskDilemmas, a diverse collection of dilemmas that pit values against one
another in scenarios relevant to AI safety risks such as Power Seeking. By
measuring an AI model's value prioritization using its aggregate choices, we
obtain a self-consistent set of predicted value priorities that uncover
potential risks. We show that values in LitmusValues (including seemingly
innocuous ones like Care) can predict for both seen risky behaviors in
AIRiskDilemmas and unseen risky behaviors in HarmBench.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为General-Reasoner的新训练范式，通过构建大规模数据集和生成式答案验证器，提升了LLM在多样化领域的推理能力，并在多个基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Motivation: 当前强化学习在LLM推理中多集中于数学和编程领域，限制了模型的泛化能力，本研究旨在通过新方法扩展其适用范围。

Method: 构建多样化领域的高质量数据集，并开发基于生成模型的答案验证器，替代传统的基于规则的验证方法。

Conclusion: General-Reasoner在多样化领域显著提升了LLM的推理能力，同时保持了在数学推理任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero,
enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate
supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM
reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data
abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability
and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often
have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we
propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM
reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include:
(1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with
verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of
disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which
replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of
chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and
evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics,
chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these
12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC)
demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods,
achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining
superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: EmoGist是一种无需训练的上下文学习方法，用于视觉情绪分类，通过上下文相关的标签定义提高准确性。

Motivation: 情绪在图像中的表现具有高度上下文依赖性和细微差别，因此需要更准确的标签定义方法。

Method: EmoGist通过聚类分析生成多个情绪标签解释，测试时根据嵌入相似性选择解释并输入快速视觉语言模型进行分类。

Result: 在多标签Memotion数据集上微F1分数提升13点，多类FI数据集上宏F1分数提升8点。

Conclusion: EmoGist在视觉情绪分类中表现出显著改进，证明了上下文相关标签定义的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EmoGist, a training-free, in-context learning
method for performing visual emotion classification with LVLMs. The key
intuition of our approach is that context-dependent definition of emotion
labels could allow more accurate predictions of emotions, as the ways in which
emotions manifest within images are highly context dependent and nuanced.
EmoGist pre-generates multiple explanations of emotion labels, by analyzing the
clusters of example images belonging to each category. At test time, we
retrieve a version of explanation based on embedding similarity, and feed it to
a fast VLM for classification. Through our experiments, we show that EmoGist
allows up to 13 points improvement in micro F1 scores with the multi-label
Memotion dataset, and up to 8 points in macro F1 in the multi-class FI dataset.

Abstract: Reward models play a critical role in guiding large language models toward
outputs that align with human expectations. However, an open challenge remains
in effectively utilizing test-time compute to enhance reward model performance.
In this work, we introduce Reward Reasoning Models (RRMs), which are
specifically designed to execute a deliberate reasoning process before
generating final rewards. Through chain-of-thought reasoning, RRMs leverage
additional test-time compute for complex queries where appropriate rewards are
not immediately apparent. To develop RRMs, we implement a reinforcement
learning framework that fosters self-evolved reward reasoning capabilities
without requiring explicit reasoning traces as training data. Experimental
results demonstrate that RRMs achieve superior performance on reward modeling
benchmarks across diverse domains. Notably, we show that RRMs can adaptively
exploit test-time compute to further improve reward accuracy. The pretrained
reward reasoning models are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了ULTRAEDIT，一种训练无关、主题无关且无记忆的模型编辑方法，适用于超大规模的现实场景终身学习。该方法通过轻量级线性代数运算快速修改模型参数，并在终身学习中采用归一化策略以适应分布变化。实验表明，ULTRAEDIT在速度和性能上均优于现有方法。

Motivation: 终身学习使大型语言模型（LLMs）能够适应不断变化的信息，但现有方法难以满足实际终身学习的可扩展性和高效性需求，因此需要一种更高效的模型编辑方法。

Method: ULTRAEDIT采用自包含的编辑过程，仅依赖轻量级线性代数运算计算参数变化，并结合终身归一化策略以适应分布变化。

Result: ULTRAEDIT在7B参数的LLM上实现了7倍以上的编辑速度提升，VRAM消耗减少到1/3以下。实验表明，该方法支持100万次编辑并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT在速度和可扩展性上均优于现有方法，为终身学习中的模型编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

Method: 提出了CoT-Bridge任务，检测思想跳跃并生成缺失的中间推理步骤，基于ScaleQM+数据集训练模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，经过修复的数据集显著提升模型性能（如NuminaMath上+5.87%），并增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提高推理完整性对模型性能有广泛益处，CoT-Bridge可作为即插即用模块与现有优化技术兼容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
mathemati-cal tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing
mathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts
omitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and
generalization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to
automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to
restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we
constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the
structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought
leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently
outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to
+5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%)
and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%),
functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization
techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to
out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning
completeness yields broadly applicable benefits.

Abstract: How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when
those beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of
understanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze
Llama-3-70B-Instruct's ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal
mediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset that consists of simple
stories where two characters each separately change the state of two objects,
potentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovered a
pervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables
the LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds
each character-object-state triple together by co-locating reference
information about them, represented as their Ordering IDs (OIs) in low rank
subspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's
beliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the
corresponding state OI and then an answer lookback retrieves the state token.
When we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the
other, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the
relation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility
lookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character
and update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into
the LM's belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering
ToM reasoning in LMs.

Motivation: 现有BNN研究主要关注模型权重和激活，忽略了输入数据的优化。本文旨在通过改进输入数据表示和模型结构，提升BNN的实用性和效率。

Method: 提出GLT编码技术，学习非线性量化阈值；结合轻量级分组卷积和块剪枝技术，并使用知识蒸馏训练。

Conclusion: GLT和块剪枝技术的结合为BNN提供了高效、轻量化的解决方案，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Existing works on Binary Neural Network (BNN) mainly focus on model's weights
and activations while discarding considerations on the input raw data. This
article introduces Generic Learned Thermometer (GLT), an encoding technique to
improve input data representation for BNN, relying on learning non linear
quantization thresholds. This technique consists in multiple data binarizations
which can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion
(ADC) that uses natural binary coding. Additionally, we jointly propose a
compact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to
block pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore
the model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings
versatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping,
enabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on
the STL-10 and VWW datasets). Moreover, when combining GLT with our proposed
block-pruning technique, we successfully achieve lightweight (under 1Mb),
fully-binarized models with limited accuracy degradation while being suitable

Conclusion: 神经算子的时间尺度与多相流应用相匹配，适合用于需要快速响应的工业控制。

Abstract: Recent progress in AI has established neural operators as powerful tools that
can predict the evolution of partial differential equations, such as the
Navier-Stokes equations. Some complex problems rely on sophisticated algorithms
to deal with strong discontinuities in the computational domain. For example,
liquid-vapour multiphase flows are a challenging problem in many
configurations, particularly those involving large density gradients or phase
change. The complexity mentioned above has not allowed for fine control of fast
industrial processes or applications because computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
models do not have a quick enough forecasting ability. This work demonstrates
that the time scale of neural operators-based predictions is comparable to the
time scale of multi-phase applications, thus proving they can be used to
control processes that require fast response. Neural Operators can be trained
using experimental data, simulations or a combination. In the following, neural
operators were trained in volume of fluid simulations, and the resulting
predictions showed very high accuracy, particularly in predicting the evolution
of the liquid-vapour interface, one of the most critical tasks in a multi-phase
process controller.

Abstract: Understanding how deep learning models represent data is currently difficult
due to the limited number of methodologies available. This paper demonstrates a
versatile and novel visualisation tool for determining the axis alignment of
embedded data at any layer in any deep learning model. In particular, it
evaluates the distribution around planes defined by the network's privileged
basis vectors. This method provides both an atomistic and a holistic, intuitive
metric for interpreting the distribution of activations across all planes. It
ensures that both positive and negative signals contribute, treating the
activation vector as a whole. Depending on the application, several variations
of this technique are presented, with a resolution scale hyperparameter to
probe different angular scales. Using this method, multiple examples are
provided that demonstrate embedded representations tend to be axis-aligned with
the privileged basis. This is not necessarily the standard basis, and it is
found that activation functions directly result in privileged bases. Hence, it
provides a direct causal link between functional form symmetry breaking and
representational alignment, explaining why representations have a tendency to
align with the neuron basis. Therefore, using this method, we begin to answer
the fundamental question of what causes the observed tendency of
representations to align with neurons. Finally, examples of so-called
grandmother neurons are found in a variety of networks.

results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines,
while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with
nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of long-time macroscopic dynamics and
thermodynamics of dissipative systems with particle fidelity is hampered by
significant obstacles. These include the strong time-scale limitations inherent
to particle simulations, the non-uniqueness of the thermodynamic potentials and
operators from given macroscopic dynamics, and the need for efficient
uncertainty quantification. This paper introduces Statistical-Physics Informed
Epistemic Diffusion Models (SPIEDiff), a machine learning framework designed to
overcome these limitations in the context of purely dissipative systems by
leveraging statistical physics, conditional diffusion models, and epinets. We
evaluate the proposed framework on stochastic Arrhenius particle processes and
demonstrate that SPIEDiff can accurately uncover both thermodynamics and
kinetics, while enabling reliable long-time macroscopic predictions using only
short-time particle simulation data. SPIEDiff can deliver accurate predictions
with quantified uncertainty in minutes, drastically reducing the computational
demand compared to direct particle simulations, which would take days or years
in the examples considered. Overall, SPIEDiff offers a robust and trustworthy
pathway for the data-driven discovery of thermodynamic models.

offers a resource-efficient alternative for fine-tuning foundation models by
dramatically reducing the number of trainable parameters. This survey examines
how LoRA has been integrated into federated fine-tuning for foundation models,
an area we term FedLoRA, by focusing on three key challenges: distributed
learning, heterogeneity, and efficiency. We further categorize existing work
based on the specific methods used to address each challenge. Finally, we
discuss open research questions and highlight promising directions for future
investigation, outlining the next steps for advancing FedLoRA.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了跨领域对齐和未知样本检测问题，梯度分析是关键。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) confronts the dual challenge of aligning
known-class distributions across domains while identifying
target-domain-specific unknown categories. Current approaches often fail to
leverage semantic relationships between modalities and struggle with error
accumulation in unknown sample detection. We propose to harness Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to address these limitations through two key
innovations: 1) Prompt-driven cross-domain alignment: Learnable textual prompts
conditioned on domain discrepancy metrics dynamically adapt CLIP's text
encoder, enabling semantic consistency between source and target domains
without explicit unknown-class supervision. 2) Gradient-aware open-set
separation: A gradient analysis module quantifies domain shift by comparing the
L2-norm of gradients from the learned prompts, where known/unknown samples
exhibit statistically distinct gradient behaviors. Evaluations on Office-Home
show that our method consistently outperforms CLIP baseline and standard
baseline. Ablation studies confirm the gradient norm's critical role.

TL;DR: 论文讨论了神经网络在科学建模中的局限性，尤其是其缺乏可解释性，并提出了一种针对物理科学的操作性定义，强调机制理解而非数学稀疏性。

Motivation: 科学界对神经网络模型的可解释性提出质疑，认为其与传统科学模型的简单数学表达不同，无法融入科学知识体系。作者旨在探讨可解释性的定义及其在科学中的作用。

Method: 作者回顾了符号回归和方程发现的相关文献，提出了一个强调机制理解而非稀疏性的可解释性定义。

Result: 研究发现稀疏性并非可解释性的必要条件，提出了一个更适合科学机器学习（SciML）的可解释性定义。

Conclusion: 基于机制的哲学定义有助于聚焦数据驱动科学的核心挑战。

Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large data sets have been successfully used
to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among
scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models, where relationships come
packaged in the form of simple mathematical expressions, the findings of the
neural network cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge.
Critics of ML's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have
converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from
more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability
has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive
models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of
interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the
precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this
work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression
tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key
papers on interpretable ML from outside the scientific community and argue
that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of
interpretability for SciML, they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting
these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability
for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes
understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it
may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary.
It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when
prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed
definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward
the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.

TL;DR: LoRASuite是一种模块化方法，通过利用现有LoRA权重和计算转移矩阵，以高效适应新版本LLM，显著减少计算资源和时间消耗。

Motivation: 随着LLM频繁更新，传统重新训练LoRA权重的方法成本高且不环保，因此需高效利用现有权重适应新模型。

Method: 计算转移矩阵，基于对齐和相似性指标分配层和注意力头，再通过小规模微调确保稳定性。

Result: LoRASuite在数学任务上表现优于全规模LoRA重训练，内存和时间消耗显著降低。

Conclusion: LoRASuite提供了一种高效、低成本的适应新LLM的方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently updated, LoRA weights trained
on earlier versions quickly become obsolete. The conventional practice of
retraining LoRA weights from scratch on the latest model is costly,
time-consuming, and environmentally detrimental, particularly as the diversity
of LLMs and downstream tasks expands. This motivates a critical question: "How
can we efficiently leverage existing LoRA weights to adapt to newer model
versions?" To address this, we propose LoRASuite, a modular approach tailored
specifically to various types of LLM updates. First, we compute a transfer
matrix utilizing known parameters from both old and new LLMs. Next, we allocate
corresponding layers and attention heads based on centered kernel alignment and
cosine similarity metrics, respectively. A subsequent small-scale, skillful
fine-tuning step ensures numerical stability. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that LoRASuite consistently surpasses small-scale vanilla LoRA
methods. Notably, on backbone LLMs such as MiniCPM and Qwen, LoRASuite even
exceeds the performance of full-scale LoRA retraining, with average
improvements of +1.4 and +6.6 points on math tasks, respectively. Additionally,
LoRASuite significantly reduces memory consumption by 5.5 GB and computational
time by 78.23%.

Motivation: 探索零样本时间序列预测在死亡率预测中的潜力，避免任务特定微调的需求。

Method: 评估TimesFM和CHRONOS两种预训练模型，并与传统方法（如ARIMA和Lee-Carter模型）及随机森林模型对比，涵盖5、10和20年的预测期。

Result: CHRONOS在短期预测中优于传统方法，TimesFM表现不佳；微调CHRONOS显著提升长期预测精度，随机森林模型整体最佳。

Conclusion: 零样本预测具有潜力，但需谨慎选择模型并结合领域适应。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of zero-shot time series forecasting, an
innovative approach leveraging pre-trained foundation models, to forecast
mortality rates without task-specific fine-tuning. We evaluate two
state-of-the-art foundation models, TimesFM and CHRONOS, alongside traditional
and machine learning-based methods across three forecasting horizons (5, 10,
and 20 years) using data from 50 countries and 111 age groups. In our
investigations, zero-shot models showed varying results: while CHRONOS
delivered competitive shorter-term forecasts, outperforming traditional methods
like ARIMA and the Lee-Carter model, TimesFM consistently underperformed.
Fine-tuning CHRONOS on mortality data significantly improved long-term
accuracy. A Random Forest model, trained on mortality data, achieved the best
overall performance. These findings underscore the potential of zero-shot
forecasting while highlighting the need for careful model selection and
domain-specific adaptation.

TL;DR: MTLA通过在时间维度压缩KV缓存，显著降低自注意力推理的内存占用，提升推理速度，同时保持性能。

Motivation: 解决Transformer自注意力中KV缓存随序列长度线性增长导致的推理效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出MTLA，利用超网络动态合并相邻时间KV缓存向量，并引入步长感知因果掩码保证训练并行性与推理一致性。

Result: 实验表明MTLA在多项任务中性能与标准MHA相当，但显著提升推理速度（如5.3倍）和GPU内存效率（降低8.3倍）。

Conclusion: MTLA能高效压缩KV缓存，平衡性能与资源开销，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: While Transformer self-attention offers strong parallelism, the Key-Value
(KV) cache grows linearly with sequence length and becomes a bottleneck for
inference efficiency. Multi-head latent attention was recently developed to
compress the KV cache into a low-rank latent space. This paper proposes
Multi-head Temporal Latent Attention (MTLA), which further reduces the KV cache
size along the temporal dimension, greatly lowering the memory footprint of
self-attention inference. MTLA employs a hyper-network to dynamically merge
temporally adjacent KV cache vectors. To address the mismatch between the
compressed KV cache and processed sequence lengths, a stride-aware causal mask
is proposed to ensure efficient parallel training and consistency with
inference behaviour. Experiments across tasks, including speech translation,
speech recognition, speech understanding and text summarisation, demonstrate
that MTLA achieves competitive performance compared to standard Multi-Head
Attention (MHA), while greatly improving inference speed and GPU memory usage.
For example, on a English-German speech translation task, MTLA achieves a 5.3x
speedup and a reduction in GPU memory usage by a factor of 8.3 compared to MHA,
while maintaining translation quality.

TL;DR: FedPrLLM是一个联邦剪枝框架，旨在保护隐私的同时压缩大语言模型（LLM），无需共享本地数据，仅需分享剪枝掩码矩阵。

Motivation: 为了解决隐私敏感领域中获取公共校准样本的难题，提出了一种保护隐私的LLM剪枝方法。

Method: 通过联邦学习框架，客户端基于本地数据计算剪枝掩码矩阵并共享给服务器，协作剪枝全局模型。

Result: 实验表明，采用层比较且不缩放权重的一次性剪枝是FedPrLLM框架中的最佳选择。

Conclusion: FedPrLLM为隐私敏感领域的LLM剪枝提供了有效指导。

Abstract: LLM pruning has emerged as a promising technology for compressing LLMs,
enabling their deployment on resource-limited devices. However, current
methodologies typically require access to public calibration samples, which can
be challenging to obtain in privacy-sensitive domains. To address this issue,
we introduce FedPrLLM, a comprehensive federated pruning framework designed for
the privacy-preserving compression of LLMs. In FedPrLLM, each client only needs
to calculate a pruning mask matrix based on its local calibration data and
share it with the server to prune the global model. This approach allows for
collaborative pruning of the global model with the knowledge of each client
while maintaining local data privacy. Additionally, we conduct extensive
experiments to explore various possibilities within the FedPrLLM framework,
including different comparison groups, pruning strategies, and the decision to
scale weights. Our extensive evaluation reveals that one-shot pruning with
layer comparison and no weight scaling is the optimal choice within the
FedPrLLM framework. We hope our work will help guide future efforts in pruning
LLMs in privacy-sensitive fields. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出UltraDelta，一种无需数据的Delta压缩方法，实现超高压缩和性能平衡。

Motivation: 解决现有Delta压缩方法在高压缩率和性能之间的不足，同时摆脱数据依赖。

Method: 基于方差分配稀疏度、分布感知压缩和全局重缩放因子优化。

Result: 在多种模型上实现133x至800x的高压缩比，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraDelta为高效存储多任务微调模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous
fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta
compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly
compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained
model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high
compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these
challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression
pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance.
UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and
stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions,
using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation
assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance
layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression
applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by
group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3)
Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a
global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression.
Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2
7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base)
with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and
(d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that
UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under
ultra-high compression.

Motivation: 传统DFL研究集中在静态环境和固定数据批次，本文旨在解决动态环境下目标函数和数据分布随时间变化的问题，填补研究空白。

Method: 通过（i）正则化目标函数使其可微分，（ii）利用乐观原则结合近优预言机和适当扰动，提出一种在线算法。

Result: 算法在单纯形和有界凸多面体决策空间上均建立了动态遗憾的期望边界，实验表明其性能优于传统预测聚焦方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的动态环境下DFL算法有效解决了目标函数不可微分和非凸的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for
training predictive models whose outputs are used in decision-making tasks.
Instead of merely optimizing for predictive accuracy, DFL trains models to
directly minimize the loss associated with downstream decisions. This
end-to-end strategy holds promise for tackling complex combinatorial problems;
however, existing studies focus solely on scenarios where a fixed batch of data
is available and the objective function does not change over time. We instead
investigate DFL in dynamic environments where the objective function and data
distribution evolve over time. This setting is challenging because the
objective function has zero or undefined gradients -- which prevents the use of
standard first-order optimization methods -- and is generally non-convex. To
address these difficulties, we (i) regularize the objective to make it
differentiable and (ii) make use of the optimism principle, based on a
near-optimal oracle along with an appropriate perturbation. This leads to a
practical online algorithm for which we establish bounds on the expected
dynamic regret, both when the decision space is a simplex and when it is a
general bounded convex polytope. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our algorithm by comparing its performance with a classic prediction-focused
approach on a simple knapsack experiment.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on neuroscience-inspired tasks offer
powerful models of brain computation. However, typical training paradigms rely
on open-loop, supervised settings, whereas real-world learning unfolds in
closed-loop environments. Here, we develop a mathematical theory describing the
learning dynamics of linear RNNs trained in closed-loop contexts. We first
demonstrate that two otherwise identical RNNs, trained in either closed- or
open-loop modes, follow markedly different learning trajectories. To probe this
divergence, we analytically characterize the closed-loop case, revealing
distinct stages aligned with the evolution of the training loss. Specifically,
we show that the learning dynamics of closed-loop RNNs, in contrast to
open-loop ones, are governed by an interplay between two competing objectives:
short-term policy improvement and long-term stability of the agent-environment
interaction. Finally, we apply our framework to a realistic motor control task,
highlighting its broader applicability. Taken together, our results underscore
the importance of modeling closed-loop dynamics in a biologically plausible
setting.

Abstract: The use of machine learning for modeling, understanding, and controlling
large-scale physics systems is quickly gaining in popularity, with examples
ranging from electromagnetism over nuclear fusion reactors and
magneto-hydrodynamics to fluid mechanics and climate modeling. These systems --
governed by partial differential equations -- present unique challenges
regarding the large number of degrees of freedom and the complex dynamics over
many scales both in space and time, and additional measures to improve accuracy
and sample efficiency are highly desirable. We present an end-to-end
equivariant surrogate model consisting of an equivariant convolutional
autoencoder and an equivariant convolutional LSTM using $G$-steerable kernels.
As a case study, we consider the three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection, which describes the buoyancy-driven fluid flow between a heated
bottom and a cooled top plate. While the system is E(2)-equivariant in the
horizontal plane, the boundary conditions break the translational equivariance
in the vertical direction. Our architecture leverages vertically stacked layers
of $D_4$-steerable kernels, with additional partial kernel sharing in the
vertical direction for further efficiency improvement. Our results demonstrate
significant gains both in sample and parameter efficiency, as well as a better
scaling to more complex dynamics, that is, larger Rayleigh numbers. The
accompanying code is available under

Conclusion: FlexFed在HAR环境中优于现有方法，解决了隐私限制下的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
privacy by allowing clients to share model updates instead of raw data.
Pervasive computing environments (e.g., for Human Activity Recognition, HAR),
which we focus on in this paper, are characterized by resource-constrained end
devices, streaming sensor data and intermittent client participation.
Variations in user behavior, common in HAR environments, often result in
non-stationary data distributions. As such, existing FL approaches face
challenges in HAR settings due to differing assumptions. The combined effects
of HAR characteristics, namely heterogeneous data and intermittent
participation, can lead to a severe issue called catastrophic forgetting (CF).
Unlike Continuous Learning (CL), which addresses CF using memory and replay
mechanisms, FL's privacy constraints prohibit such strategies.
  To tackle CF in HAR environments, we propose FlexFed, a novel FL approach
that prioritizes data retention for efficient memory use and dynamically
adjusts offline training frequency based on distribution shifts, client
capability and offline duration. To better quantify CF in FL, we introduce a
new metric that accounts for under-represented data, enabling more accurate
evaluations. We also develop a realistic HAR-based evaluation framework that
simulates streaming data, dynamic distributions, imbalances and varying
availability. Experiments show that FlexFed mitigates CF more effectively,
improves FL efficiency by 10 to 15 % and achieves faster, more stable
convergence, especially for infrequent or under-represented data.

Abstract: We study the problem of reducing a task cost functional $W(S)$, defined over
Sobolev-class signals $S$, when the cost is invariant under a global symmetry
group $G \subset \mathrm{Diff}(M)$ and accessible only as a black-box. Such
scenarios arise in machine learning, imaging, and inverse problems, where cost
metrics reflect model outputs or performance scores but are non-differentiable
and model-internal. We propose a variational method that exploits the symmetry
structure to construct explicit, symmetry-breaking deformations of the input
signal. A gauge field $\phi$, obtained by minimizing an auxiliary energy
functional, induces a deformation $h = A_\phi[S]$ that generically lies
transverse to the $G$-orbit of $S$. We prove that, under mild regularity, the
cost $W$ strictly decreases along this direction -- either via Clarke
subdifferential descent or by escaping locally flat plateaus. The exceptional
set of degeneracies has zero Gaussian measure. Our approach requires no access
to model gradients or labels and operates entirely at test time. It provides a
principled tool for optimizing invariant cost functionals via Lie-algebraic
variational flows, with applications to black-box models and
symmetry-constrained tasks.

Abstract: We build a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model from scratch to
solve sequential decision making tasks arising in contexts of operations
research and management science which we call OMGPT. We first propose a general
sequence modeling framework to cover several operational decision making tasks
as special cases, such as dynamic pricing, inventory management, resource
allocation, and queueing control. Under the framework, all these tasks can be
viewed as a sequential prediction problem where the goal is to predict the
optimal future action given all the historical information. Then we train a
transformer-based neural network model (OMGPT) as a natural and powerful
architecture for sequential modeling. This marks a paradigm shift compared to
the existing methods for these OR/OM tasks in that (i) the OMGPT model can take
advantage of the huge amount of pre-trained data; (ii) when tackling these
problems, OMGPT does not assume any analytical model structure and enables a
direct and rich mapping from the history to the future actions. Either of these
two aspects, to the best of our knowledge, is not achieved by any existing
method. We establish a Bayesian perspective to theoretically understand the
working mechanism of the OMGPT on these tasks, which relates its performance
with the pre-training task diversity and the divergence between the testing
task and pre-training tasks. Numerically, we observe a surprising performance
of the proposed model across all the above tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates the sample dependence of critical points for neural
networks. We introduce a sample-independent critical lifting operator that
associates a parameter of one network with a set of parameters of another, thus
defining sample-dependent and sample-independent lifted critical points. We
then show by example that previously studied critical embeddings do not capture
all sample-independent lifted critical points. Finally, we demonstrate the

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过Zero-Shot NAS自动剪枝搜索空间的方法，显著降低了One-Shot NAS的内存消耗和搜索时间，同时保持准确性。

Motivation: 为了解决One-Shot NAS方法在搜索过程中GPU内存消耗高的问题，提出了一种高效的剪枝策略。

Method: 使用Zero-Shot NAS预先从搜索空间中去除低性能架构，再对剪枝后的空间应用One-Shot NAS。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在DARTS搜索空间上将内存消耗降低了81%，同时保持了相同的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了One-Shot NAS的高内存消耗问题，提升了搜索效率。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful tool for automating
architecture design. One-Shot NAS techniques, such as DARTS, have gained
substantial popularity due to their combination of search efficiency with
simplicity of implementation. By design, One-Shot methods have high GPU memory
requirements during the search. To mitigate this issue, we propose to prune the
search space in an efficient automatic manner to reduce memory consumption and
search time while preserving the search accuracy. Specifically, we utilise
Zero-Shot NAS to efficiently remove low-performing architectures from the
search space before applying One-Shot NAS to the pruned search space.
Experimental results on the DARTS search space show that our approach reduces
memory consumption by 81% compared to the baseline One-Shot setup while
achieving the same level of accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效估计深度神经网络Fisher信息度量张量的方法，通过核心空间分析扩展到神经流形的确定性边界，并引入了基于Hutchinson迹估计器的无偏随机估计。

Motivation: 现代深度神经网络的参数空间（神经流形）具有独特的Fisher信息度量张量，准确估计它对理论和实际方法至关重要。

Method: 通过分析分类网络的核心空间中的Riemannian度量谱，扩展到神经流形的度量张量边界，并引入基于Hutchinson迹估计器的无偏随机估计方法。

Result: 方法可通过单次反向传播高效估计度量张量（对角线、块对角线或完整张量），其质量由真实值的标准差保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习中Fisher信息度量张量的估计提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The high dimensional parameter space of modern deep neural networks -- the
neuromanifold -- is endowed with a unique metric tensor defined by the Fisher
information, estimating which is crucial for both theory and practical methods
in deep learning. To analyze this tensor for classification networks, we return
to a low dimensional space of probability distributions -- the core space --
and carefully analyze the spectrum of its Riemannian metric. We extend our
discoveries there into deterministic bounds of the metric tensor on the
neuromanifold. We introduce an unbiased random estimate of the metric tensor
and its bounds based on Hutchinson's trace estimator. It can be evaluated
efficiently through a single backward pass and can be used to estimate the
diagonal, or block diagonal, or the full tensor. Its quality is guaranteed with
a standard deviation bounded by the true value up to scaling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应约束等变性（ACE）方法，通过逐步降低非等变性模型的偏差来平衡等变性与非等变性，提升性能、样本效率和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 现实数据常偏离完美对称性，传统严格等变模型难以适应，而无约束模型无法有效利用部分对称性。ACE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用同伦原理，通过约束优化逐步将非等变模型转化为接近等变性，平衡对称性与灵活性。

Result: 在多架构和任务中，ACE显著优于严格等变模型和启发式放松方法，提升了性能指标和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACE提供了一种数据驱动的平衡策略，有效解决了对称性与模型灵活性之间的矛盾。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks are designed to respect symmetries through their
architecture, boosting generalization and sample efficiency when those
symmetries are present in the data distribution. Real-world data, however,
often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation,
measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant
models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a
principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully
symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a
restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where
an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem
into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a
constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant
model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual
tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven
equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across
multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance
metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with
strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Peer Elicitation Games (PEG)，一种无需训练的游戏理论框架，通过多个判别器的合作来减少大语言模型（LLMs）的幻觉和不一致问题。

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然在生成能力上表现优异，但仍存在幻觉和不一致问题。PEG旨在通过游戏理论机制，无需监督或微调即可提升模型的真实性和一致性。

Method: PEG框架包括一个生成器和多个判别器，它们通过在线学习和同伴评估机制互动。奖励基于确定性互信息评分，激励真实报告，无需真实标签。

Result: 理论证明表明，每个代理在在线学习中能够以次线性遗憾接近最佳固定策略，并收敛到真实的纳什均衡。实证结果显示其显著提高了事实准确性。

Conclusion: PEG是一种无需监督或微调的实用方法，能够有效提升LLMs的真实性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
but remain prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. We introduce Peer
Elicitation Games (PEG), a training-free, game-theoretic framework for aligning
LLMs through a peer elicitation mechanism involving a generator and multiple
discriminators instantiated from distinct base models. Discriminators interact
in a peer evaluation setting, where rewards are computed using a
determinant-based mutual information score that provably incentivizes truthful
reporting without requiring ground-truth labels. We establish theoretical
guarantees showing that each agent, via online learning, achieves sublinear
regret in the sense their cumulative performance approaches that of the best
fixed truthful strategy in hindsight. Moreover, we prove last-iterate
convergence to a truthful Nash equilibrium, ensuring that the actual policies
used by agents converge to stable and truthful behavior over time. Empirical
evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in
factual accuracy. These results position PEG as a practical approach for
eliciting truthful behavior from LLMs without supervision or fine-tuning.

Method: 提出FedCTTA框架，利用基于噪声样本的相似性聚合和最小化客户端熵，实现隐私保护和高效适应。

Result: 实验表明，FedCTTA在时空异构场景下优于现有方法，且具有可扩展性。

Conclusion: FedCTTA是一种高效、隐私保护的联邦适应框架，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL models often suffer performance
degradation due to distribution shifts between training and deployment.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by allowing models to
adapt using only test samples. However, existing TTA methods in FL face
challenges such as computational overhead, privacy risks from feature sharing,
and scalability concerns due to memory constraints. To address these
limitations, we propose Federated Continual Test-Time Adaptation (FedCTTA), a
privacy-preserving and computationally efficient framework for federated
adaptation. Unlike prior methods that rely on sharing local feature statistics,
FedCTTA avoids direct feature exchange by leveraging similarity-aware
aggregation based on model output distributions over randomly generated noise
samples. This approach ensures adaptive knowledge sharing while preserving data
privacy. Furthermore, FedCTTA minimizes the entropy at each client for
continual adaptation, enhancing the model's confidence in evolving target
distributions. Our method eliminates the need for server-side training during
adaptation and maintains a constant memory footprint, making it scalable even
as the number of clients or training rounds increases. Extensive experiments
show that FedCTTA surpasses existing methods across diverse temporal and
spatial heterogeneity scenarios.

Motivation: 在科学机器学习中，通过嵌套反向传播计算偏微分方程（PDE）算子成本高昂，限制了其应用。虽然已有前向Laplacian和随机化泰勒模式自动微分（AD）等改进方案，但仍需更高效的优化技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学机器学习中的PDE算子计算提供了一种高效且用户友好的优化方案，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Computing partial differential equation (PDE) operators via nested
backpropagation is expensive, yet popular, and severely restricts their utility
for scientific machine learning. Recent advances, like the forward Laplacian
and randomizing Taylor mode automatic differentiation (AD), propose forward
schemes to address this. We introduce an optimization technique for Taylor mode
that 'collapses' derivatives by rewriting the computational graph, and
demonstrate how to apply it to general linear PDE operators, and randomized
Taylor mode. The modifications simply require propagating a sum up the
computational graph, which could -- or should -- be done by a machine learning
compiler, without exposing complexity to users. We implement our collapsing
procedure and evaluate it on popular PDE operators, confirming it accelerates
Taylor mode and outperforms nested backpropagation.

Motivation: 现有的图对比学习方法在生成高质量正样本对时面临挑战，可能导致原始图的语义和结构信息失真。

Method: 提出SRGCL框架，利用模型自身的编码器动态评估和选择高质量正样本对，结合多种增强策略和流形假设指导的选择器。

Result: SRGCL在多样化的图分类任务中表现出色，优于现有的GCL方法。

Conclusion: SRGCL通过自我增强机制提升了图对比学习的表现，展示了其跨领域的适应性和有效性。

Abstract: Graphs serve as versatile data structures in numerous real-world
domains-including social networks, molecular biology, and knowledge graphs-by
capturing intricate relational information among entities. Among graph-based
learning techniques, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has gained significant
attention for its ability to derive robust, self-supervised graph
representations through the contrasting of positive and negative sample pairs.
However, a critical challenge lies in ensuring high-quality positive pairs so
that the intrinsic semantic and structural properties of the original graph are
preserved rather than distorted. To address this issue, we propose SRGCL
(Self-Reinforced Graph Contrastive Learning), a novel framework that leverages
the model's own encoder to dynamically evaluate and select high-quality
positive pairs. We designed a unified positive pair generator employing
multiple augmentation strategies, and a selector guided by the manifold
hypothesis to maintain the underlying geometry of the latent space. By adopting
a probabilistic mechanism for selecting positive pairs, SRGCL iteratively
refines its assessment of pair quality as the encoder's representational power
improves. Extensive experiments on diverse graph-level classification tasks
demonstrate that SRGCL, as a plug-in module, consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art GCL methods, underscoring its adaptability and efficacy across
various domains.

TL;DR: 本文分析了基于强化学习（RL）的后训练大型语言模型（LLMs）的简化假设，提出这些假设导致RL方法等效于监督学习，并通过实验验证了迭代监督微调的性能与GRPO相当。

Motivation: 研究动机在于质疑当前流行的RL后训练LLMs的假设和框架，特别是GRPO在提升模型推理能力中的作用。

Method: 方法包括分析RL框架中的简化假设（如MDP状态的拼接和奖励均匀分配），并通过实验比较RL和迭代监督微调在GSM8K和Countdown基准上的性能。

Result: 结果表明，迭代监督微调（结合正负样本）的性能与GRPO训练相当，且RL的结构假设可能导致生成更长序列的中间标记。

Conclusion: 结论指出RL在提升LLMs推理能力中可能有效，但当前的简化假设和框架有待商榷。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning-based post-training of large language models (LLMs)
has recently gained attention, particularly following the release of DeepSeek
R1, which applied GRPO for fine-tuning. Amid the growing hype around improved
reasoning abilities attributed to RL post-training, we critically examine the
formulation and assumptions underlying these methods. We start by highlighting
the popular structural assumptions made in modeling LLM training as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), and show how they lead to a degenerate MDP that doesn't
quite need the RL/GRPO apparatus. The two critical structural assumptions
include (1) making the MDP states be just a concatenation of the actions-with
states becoming the context window and the actions becoming the tokens in LLMs
and (2) splitting the reward of a state-action trajectory uniformly across the
trajectory. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that these
simplifying assumptions make the approach effectively equivalent to an
outcome-driven supervised learning. Our experiments on benchmarks including
GSM8K and Countdown using Qwen-2.5 base models show that iterative supervised
fine-tuning, incorporating both positive and negative samples, achieves
performance comparable to GRPO-based training. We will also argue that the
structural assumptions indirectly incentivize the RL to generate longer
sequences of intermediate tokens-which in turn feeds into the narrative of "RL
generating longer thinking traces." While RL may well be a very useful
technique for improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs, our analysis shows
that the simplistic structural assumptions made in modeling the underlying MDP
render the popular LLM RL frameworks and their interpretations questionable.

Conclusion: 无监督异常检测方法适合MUED故障图像检测，且有潜力应用于其他类似场景。

Abstract: This study focus in the construction of an unsupervised anomaly detection
methodology to detect faulty images in MUED. We believe that unsupervised
techniques are the best choice for our purposes because the data used to train
the detector does not need to be manually labeled, and instead, the machine is
intended to detect by itself the anomalies in the dataset, which liberates the
user of tedious, time-consuming initial image examination. The structure must,
additionally, provide the user with some measure of uncertainty in the
detection, so the user can take decisions based on this measure.

Motivation: 现有的离线模型强化学习方法（MBRL）通常采用两阶段训练，导致世界模型未针对策略学习优化，且策略在部署时缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 提出统一的框架，通过Stackelberg学习动态求解最大-最小优化问题，动态调整世界模型与策略。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo和Tokamak Control任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 动态调整世界模型与策略能有效提升离线MBRL的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for
data-driven control. Compared to model-free approaches, offline model-based RL
(MBRL) explicitly learns a world model from a static dataset and uses it as a
surrogate simulator, improving data efficiency and enabling potential
generalization beyond the dataset support. However, most existing offline MBRL
methods follow a two-stage training procedure: first learning a world model by
maximizing the likelihood of the observed transitions, then optimizing a policy
to maximize its expected return under the learned model. This objective
mismatch results in a world model that is not necessarily optimized for
effective policy learning. Moreover, we observe that policies learned via
offline MBRL often lack robustness during deployment, and small adversarial
noise in the environment can lead to significant performance degradation. To
address these, we propose a framework that dynamically adapts the world model
alongside the policy under a unified learning objective aimed at improving
robustness. At the core of our method is a maximin optimization problem, which
we solve by innovatively utilizing Stackelberg learning dynamics. We provide
theoretical analysis to support our design and introduce computationally
efficient implementations. We benchmark our algorithm on twelve noisy D4RL
MuJoCo tasks and three stochastic Tokamak Control tasks, demonstrating its
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 高斯过程在大规模数据集上的推断因计算复杂度高而受限，需要一种更高效的算法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用了分布式加速的草图投影算法（ADASAP），并结合行列式点过程理论证明其快速收敛性。

Result: ADASAP在多个基准数据集和贝叶斯优化任务中优于现有方法，并能处理超过3亿样本的数据集。

Conclusion: ADASAP是一种高效、可扩展的GP推断算法，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) play an essential role in biostatistics, scientific
machine learning, and Bayesian optimization for their ability to provide
probabilistic predictions and model uncertainty. However, GP inference
struggles to scale to large datasets (which are common in modern applications),
since it requires the solution of a linear system whose size scales
quadratically with the number of samples in the dataset. We propose an
approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm
($\texttt{ADASAP}$) for solving these linear systems, which improves
scalability. We use the theory of determinantal point processes to show that
the posterior mean induced by sketch-and-project rapidly converges to the true
posterior mean. In particular, this yields the first efficient, condition
number-free algorithm for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral
basis functions, showing that our approach is principled for GP inference.
$\texttt{ADASAP}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on conjugate
gradient and coordinate descent across several benchmark datasets and a
large-scale Bayesian optimization task. Moreover, $\texttt{ADASAP}$ scales to a
dataset with $> 3 \cdot 10^8$ samples, a feat which has not been accomplished
in the literature.

Method: 通过研究超参数缩放规律，验证最佳时间尺度与参数-标记比的关系，并分析批量大小的缩放规律。

Result: 发现最优权重衰减λ随批量大小B线性缩放，最佳批量大小Bopt与临界批量大小Bcrit与数据集大小D呈幂律关系，与模型大小N无关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为大规模训练中超参数设置和模型优化提供了理论支持，有助于提高训练效率。

Abstract: Efficient LLM pre-training requires well-tuned hyperparameters (HPs),
including learning rate {\eta} and weight decay {\lambda}. We study scaling
laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset
size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale,
B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we
verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a
fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise
power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a
method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training.
We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest
loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further
data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast with prior work, we find
both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N.
Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of
Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives.

Result: 在2D合成数据、CLEVR位置任务和文本到图像合成中显著提升了条件对齐。

Conclusion: lift scores在不增加训练负担的情况下有效改进了组合生成。

Abstract: We introduce a novel resampling criterion using lift scores, for improving
compositional generation in diffusion models. By leveraging the lift scores, we
evaluate whether generated samples align with each single condition and then
compose the results to determine whether the composed prompt is satisfied. Our
key insight is that lift scores can be efficiently approximated using only the
original diffusion model, requiring no additional training or external modules.
We develop an optimized variant that achieves relatively lower computational
overhead during inference while maintaining effectiveness. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that lift scores significantly improved the
condition alignment for compositional generation across 2D synthetic data,
CLEVR position tasks, and text-to-image synthesis. Our code is available at

Abstract: The problem of data non-stationarity is commonly addressed in data stream
processing. In a dynamic environment, methods should continuously be ready to
analyze time-varying data -- hence, they should enable incremental training and
respond to concept drifts. An equally important variability typical for
non-stationary data stream environments is the emergence of new, previously
unknown classes. Often, methods focus on one of these two phenomena --
detection of concept drifts or detection of novel classes -- while both
difficulties can be observed in data streams. Additionally, concerning
previously unknown observations, the topic of open set of classes has become
particularly important in recent years, where the goal of methods is to
efficiently classify within known classes and recognize objects outside the
model competence. This article presents a strategy for synthetic data stream
generation in which both concept drifts and the emergence of new classes
representing unknown objects occur. The presented research shows how
unsupervised drift detectors address the task of detecting novelty and concept
drifts and demonstrates how the generated data streams can be utilized in the
open set recognition task.

TL;DR: 首個針對動態圖的最大獨立集（MaxIS）無監督學習模型，結合圖神經網絡（GNN）與分散式更新機制，在單一步驟中高效處理邊的變動並推斷節點成員資格。

Abstract: We present the first unsupervised learning model for finding Maximum
Independent Sets (MaxIS) in dynamic graphs where edges change over time. Our
method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a
learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion
event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a
single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's
radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various
dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art MaxIS
methods for static graphs, including a mixed integer programming solver,
deterministic rule-based algorithms, and a heuristic learning framework based
on dynamic programming and GNNs. Across synthetic and real-world dynamic graphs
of 100-10,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with
excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art heuristic learning framework in solution quality, runtime, and
memory usage. Our model generalizes well on graphs 100x larger than the ones
used for training, achieving performance at par with both a greedy technique
and a commercial mixed integer programming solver while running 1.5-23x faster
than greedy.

TL;DR: Panda模型通过训练合成混沌系统数据集，展示了零样本预测真实世界混沌系统和涌现非线性共振模式的能力，并揭示了预训练模型在非线性动力学等数学领域的潜力。

Motivation: 混沌系统对小误差高度敏感，传统方法难以构建预测性数据驱动模型。本文旨在通过预训练模型解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Panda模型，基于进化算法生成的2×10^4个混沌系统合成数据集进行训练，使用Patched Attention技术。

Result: Panda表现出零样本预测真实混沌系统的能力，并能自发预测偏微分方程，展示了预训练模型的强大潜力。

Conclusion: Panda模型为非线性动力学等抽象数学领域的探索提供了新工具，展现了预训练模型的广阔前景。

Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging
efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical
systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either
specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation
models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical
structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched
Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic,
extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we
discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data,
Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world
chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention
heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary
differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict
partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural
scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of
pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear
dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文主要研究了离散预测任务中替代损失函数的统计一致性，提出了一种更容易验证的条件——间接引发（IE），并证明了其在校准问题中的等效性。对于非多面体（如凸可微）损失函数，首次展示了类似结果，并提出了强IE条件以确保一致性。

Motivation: 直接验证离散预测任务中替代损失函数的校准条件通常繁琐。研究旨在找到更易验证的条件（IE），并扩展其适用性。

Method: 针对凸可微损失函数，证明了IE与校准的等效性；在高维情况下提出强IE条件，并验证其作用。

Result: 一维情况下IE与校准等价，高维则失效；强IE确保校准，且对强凸可微函数是充要条件。

Conclusion: IE和强IE为设计和分析一致性可微替代损失提供了有力工具。

Abstract: The statistical consistency of surrogate losses for discrete prediction tasks
is often checked via the condition of calibration. However, directly verifying
calibration can be arduous. Recent work shows that for polyhedral surrogates, a
less arduous condition, indirect elicitation (IE), is still equivalent to
calibration. We give the first results of this type for non-polyhedral
surrogates, specifically the class of convex differentiable losses. We first
prove that under mild conditions, IE and calibration are equivalent for
one-dimensional losses in this class. We construct a counter-example that shows
that this equivalence fails in higher dimensions. This motivates the
introduction of strong IE, a strengthened form of IE that is equally easy to
verify. We establish that strong IE implies calibration for differentiable
surrogates and is both necessary and sufficient for strongly convex,
differentiable surrogates. Finally, we apply these results to a range of
problems to demonstrate the power of IE and strong IE for designing and
analyzing consistent differentiable surrogates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为WIND的新策略，通过并行处理窗口内的多帧信号加速RNN-T推理，同时保持模型精度。

Motivation: 为了提高RNN-T模型的推理速度而不影响其准确性，作者提出了一种新的并行处理策略。

Method: WIND策略通过窗口内并行处理多帧信号，快速定位非空白预测，并适用于贪心解码、批量贪心解码和新的波束搜索解码方法。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，贪心模式下速度提升高达2.4倍，且WER保持不变；波束搜索算法在速度显著提升的同时精度略有提高。

Conclusion: WIND是一种高效的RNN-T推理加速方法，适用于多种解码场景。

Abstract: We propose Windowed Inference for Non-blank Detection (WIND), a novel
strategy that significantly accelerates RNN-T inference without compromising
model accuracy. During model inference, instead of processing frames
sequentially, WIND processes multiple frames simultaneously within a window in
parallel, allowing the model to quickly locate non-blank predictions during
decoding, resulting in significant speed-ups. We implement WIND for greedy
decoding, batched greedy decoding with label-looping techniques, and also
propose a novel beam-search decoding method. Experiments on multiple datasets
with different conditions show that our method, when operating in greedy modes,
speeds up as much as 2.4X compared to the baseline sequential approach while
maintaining identical Word Error Rate (WER) performance. Our beam-search
algorithm achieves slightly better accuracy than alternative methods, with
significantly improved speed. We will open-source our WIND implementation.

Abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement
learning (RL) in which the agent can leverage both an offline dataset and
online interactions to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm
and analysis and show that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms
with the offline dataset outperforms any pure online or offline algorithm alone
and achieves state-of-the-art results under two learning metrics, i.e.,
sub-optimality gap and online learning regret. Specifically, we show that our
algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$, where
$\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)$ is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$
are the numbers of offline and online samples, respectively. For regret
minimization, we show that it achieves a constant $\tilde{O}(
\sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up compared to pure
online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability
coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an
interesting separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline
dataset for sub-optimality gap minimization and regret minimization. We further
validate our theoretical findings in several experiments in special RL models
such as linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes (MDPs).

TL;DR: 研究表明，尽管大型推理模型通过思维链（CoT）训练在性能上有所提升，但中间推理步骤的准确性与其解决方案的准确性关联不大，甚至噪声数据也能保持或提升性能，挑战了CoT的常规解释。

Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型中的中间推理步骤（如思维链）是否真的影响模型性能，以及这些步骤的语义是否如人们所认为的那样重要。

Method: 训练Transformer模型于形式化验证的推理痕迹和解决方案，评估中间步骤和最终输出的正确性，并使用噪声数据验证其影响。

Result: 即使中间步骤错误，模型仍能提供正确解决方案；噪声数据甚至可能提升性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 中间推理步骤的准确性与其解决方案的准确性关联较弱，需谨慎解读其语义和人类化行为。

Abstract: Recent impressive results from large reasoning models have been interpreted
as a triumph of Chain of Thought (CoT), and especially of the process of
training on CoTs sampled from base LLMs in order to help find new reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we critically examine that interpretation by
investigating how the semantics of intermediate tokens-often anthropomorphized
as "thoughts" or reasoning traces and which are claimed to display behaviors
like backtracking, self-verification etc.-actually influence model performance.
We train transformer models on formally verifiable reasoning traces and
solutions, constraining both intermediate steps and final outputs to align with
those of a formal solver (in our case, A* search). By constructing a formal
interpreter of the semantics of our problems and intended algorithm, we
systematically evaluate not only solution accuracy but also the correctness of
intermediate traces, thus allowing us to evaluate whether the latter causally
influences the former. We notice that, despite significant improvements on the
solution-only baseline, models trained on entirely correct traces still produce
invalid reasoning traces when arriving at correct solutions. To further show
that trace accuracy is only loosely connected to solution accuracy, we then
train models on noisy, corrupted traces which have no relation to the specific
problem each is paired with, and find that not only does performance remain
largely consistent with models trained on correct data, but in some cases can
improve upon it and generalize more robustly on out-of-distribution tasks.
These results challenge the assumption that intermediate tokens or "Chains of
Thought" induce predictable reasoning behaviors and caution against
anthropomorphizing such outputs or over-interpreting them (despite their mostly
correct forms) as evidence of human-like or algorithmic behaviors in language
models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在AI训练中引入谎言检测器对模型诚实性的影响，发现其效果取决于探索量、检测器准确性和KL正则化强度，可能导致诚实或欺骗行为。

Motivation: 研究AI系统中欺骗行为对评估和部署的影响，以及谎言检测器在训练中的潜在作用与风险。

Method: 使用DolusChat数据集，结合谎言检测器与GRPO/DPO算法，分析诚实性因素。

Result: GRPO可能导致高欺骗率（85%），而DPO则保持低欺骗率（25%）。检测器准确性和KL正则化是关键。

Conclusion: 谎言检测器训练效果复杂，既可能增强监督，也可能加剧未检测到的欺骗。

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, deceptive behaviors can undermine
evaluation and mislead users at deployment. Recent work has shown that lie
detectors can accurately classify deceptive behavior, but they are not
typically used in the training pipeline due to concerns around contamination
and objective hacking. We examine these concerns by incorporating a lie
detector into the labelling step of LLM post-training and evaluating whether
the learned policy is genuinely more honest, or instead learns to fool the lie
detector while remaining deceptive. Using DolusChat, a novel 65k-example
dataset with paired truthful/deceptive responses, we identify three key factors
that determine the honesty of learned policies: amount of exploration during
preference learning, lie detector accuracy, and KL regularization strength. We
find that preference learning with lie detectors and GRPO can lead to policies
which evade lie detectors, with deception rates of over 85\%. However, if the
lie detector true positive rate (TPR) or KL regularization is sufficiently
high, GRPO learns honest policies. In contrast, off-policy algorithms (DPO)
consistently lead to deception rates under 25\% for realistic TPRs. Our results
illustrate a more complex picture than previously assumed: depending on the
context, lie-detector-enhanced training can be a powerful tool for scalable
oversight, or a counterproductive method encouraging undetectable misalignment.

TL;DR: Quetzal是一种简单但可扩展的自回归模型，用于3D分子生成，通过原子逐个构建分子，结合了因果变换器和扩散MLP，在生成质量和速度上优于现有基线。

Motivation: 现有3D分子生成方法中扩散模型占主导，自回归模型表现较差，Quetzal旨在提升自回归模型的性能和扩展性。

Method: Quetzal将分子视为有序原子序列，用因果变换器预测下一个原子的离散类型，用扩散MLP建模连续位置分布。

Result: Quetzal在生成质量和速度上优于现有自回归基线，且支持可变大小任务（如氢装饰和支架完成）。

Conclusion: Quetzal为3D分子生成提供了新的可扩展性和通用性视角。

Abstract: Generative models of 3D molecular structure play a rapidly growing role in
the design and simulation of molecules. Diffusion models currently dominate the
space of 3D molecule generation, while autoregressive models have trailed
behind. In this work, we present Quetzal, a simple but scalable autoregressive
model that builds molecules atom-by-atom in 3D. Treating each molecule as an
ordered sequence of atoms, Quetzal combines a causal transformer that predicts
the next atom's discrete type with a smaller Diffusion MLP that models the
continuous next-position distribution. Compared to existing autoregressive
baselines, Quetzal achieves substantial improvements in generation quality and
is competitive with the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. In
addition, by reducing the number of expensive forward passes through a dense
transformer, Quetzal enables significantly faster generation speed, as well as
exact divergence-based likelihood computation. Finally, without any
architectural changes, Quetzal natively handles variable-size tasks like
hydrogen decoration and scaffold completion. We hope that our work motivates a
perspective on scalability and generality for generative modelling of 3D
molecules.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过上下文无关生成（context-free generation）来近似估计KL散度的方法，以减少语言模型在微调时对原有任务的遗忘现象。

Motivation: 微调语言模型时，模型参数的变化可能导致其在其他任务上的性能下降（即“遗忘”）。论文的目标是在无法访问原始训练数据的情况下，通过一种简单的方法缓解遗忘问题。

Method: 使用上下文无关生成近似估计KL散度，并将生成的合成数据与微调数据集结合，以减少遗忘。

Result: 实验表明，上下文无关生成能够有效减少遗忘，尤其是在保留预训练模型的零样本性能和推理模型的推理能力方面。合成上下文数据或部分预训练数据的效果较差。

Conclusion: 上下文无关生成是一种简单且有效的方法，可用于缓解语言模型微调时的遗忘问题。

Abstract: Fine-tuning a language model often results in a degradation of its existing
performance on other tasks, due to a shift in the model parameters; this
phenomenon is often referred to as (catastrophic) forgetting. We are interested
in mitigating this, in settings where we only have access to the model weights
but no access to its training data/recipe. A natural approach is to penalize
the KL divergence between the original model and the new one. Our main
realization is that a simple process - which we term context-free generation -
allows for an approximate unbiased estimation of this KL divergence. We show
that augmenting a fine-tuning dataset with context-free generations mitigates
forgetting, in two settings: (a) preserving the zero-shot performance of
pretrained-only models, and (b) preserving the reasoning performance of
thinking models. We show that contextual synthetic data, and even a portion of
the pretraining data, are less effective. We also investigate the effect of
choices like generation temperature, data ratios etc. We present our results
for OLMo-1B for pretrained-only setting and R1-Distill-Llama-8B for the
reasoning setting.

TL;DR: 论文分析了KAN的计算速度问题，提出了FlashKAT解决方案，显著提升了训练速度。

Motivation: KAN虽然表达能力更强且可解释性高，但因计算成本高和训练不稳定，限制了其在大规模任务中的应用。KAT虽有类似FLOPs，但训练速度仍慢123倍。

Method: 研究发现性能瓶颈源于内存停滞和梯度积累效率低。FlashKAT通过优化内核结构和减少梯度积累来提升效率。

Result: FlashKAT实现了86.5倍的训练速度提升，同时减少了系数梯度的舍入误差。

Conclusion: FlashKAT有效解决了KAT的内存瓶颈，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has been gaining popularity as an
alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with its increased
expressiveness and interpretability. However, the KAN can be orders of
magnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training
instability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs
similar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational
KAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our
characterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds,
indicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this
paper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the
slowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls
and, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient
gradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT,
which builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation
with atomic adds and accesses to slow memory. Evaluations demonstrate that
FlashKAT can achieve a training speedup of 86.5x compared with the
state-of-the-art KAT, while reducing rounding errors in the coefficient
gradients. Our code is available at https://github.com/OSU-STARLAB/FlashKAT.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在部分无序样本信息泄露下的脆弱性，提出了一种更通用的威胁模型和两种数据无关的攻击方法，强调了其鲁棒性。

Motivation: 探讨在攻击者仅掌握部分、无序样本信息时，LLMs是否会泄露敏感训练数据。

Method: 引入了两种数据无关的方法：（1）基于成员推断的似然比攻击；（2）利用外部先验信息的PRISM方法。

Result: 在医疗和法律场景中，这两种方法与假设具备标记数据的基线分类器表现相当。

Conclusion: 细调后的LLMs在部分信息攻击下仍存在泄露风险。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can leak sensitive training data through
memorization and membership inference attacks. Prior work has primarily focused
on strong adversarial assumptions, including attacker access to entire samples
or long, ordered prefixes, leaving open the question of how vulnerable LLMs are
when adversaries have only partial, unordered sample information. For example,
if an attacker knows a patient has "hypertension," under what conditions can
they query a model fine-tuned on patient data to learn the patient also has
"osteoarthritis?" In this paper, we introduce a more general threat model under
this weaker assumption and show that fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to these
fragment-specific extraction attacks. To systematically investigate these
attacks, we propose two data-blind methods: (1) a likelihood ratio attack
inspired by methods from membership inference, and (2) a novel approach, PRISM,
which regularizes the ratio by leveraging an external prior. Using examples
from both medical and legal settings, we show that both methods are competitive
with a data-aware baseline classifier that assumes access to labeled
in-distribution data, underscoring their robustness.

Result: 在多个数据集上优于基于标记级蒸馏和模仿学习的基线，显著压缩模型尺寸且性能下降较小。

Conclusion: 分段对齐是高效可部署智能体的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making
agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style
frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference
costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a
framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models
while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike
standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into
{[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each
component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables
compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments
on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently
outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant
compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further
highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable
agents.

Abstract: Characterizing the ground state properties of quantum systems is fundamental
to capturing their behavior but computationally challenging. Recent advances in
AI have introduced novel approaches, with diverse machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) models proposed for this purpose. However, the necessity and
specific role of DL models in these tasks remain unclear, as prior studies
often employ varied or impractical quantum resources to construct datasets,
resulting in unfair comparisons. To address this, we systematically benchmark
DL models against traditional ML approaches across three families of
Hamiltonian, scaling up to 127 qubits in three crucial ground-state learning
tasks while enforcing equivalent quantum resource usage. Our results reveal
that ML models often achieve performance comparable to or even exceeding that
of DL approaches across all tasks. Furthermore, a randomization test
demonstrates that measurement input features have minimal impact on DL models'
prediction performance. These findings challenge the necessity of current DL
models in many quantum system learning scenarios and provide valuable insights
into their effective utilization.

Motivation: 现实世界中，GPS轨迹常因采样率低且间隔不规则而难以直接使用。传统方法未能充分利用轨迹和路网的复杂时空动态，限制了恢复效果。

Method: 提出TedTrajRec方法：1. 使用PD-GNN建模周期性交通动态和拓扑感知的路段动态；2. 提出TedFormer（时间感知Transformer），通过神经微分方程融入注意力机制处理不规则采样数据。

Conclusion: 通过分解时空动态并分别建模，TedTrajRec显著提升了低采样率GPS轨迹的恢复效果。

Abstract: In real-world applications, GPS trajectories often suffer from low sampling
rates, with large and irregular intervals between consecutive GPS points. This
sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based
systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery,
aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous
studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder
captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target
trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network
and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall
performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage
the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the
road network.
  To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of
trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics
and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for
trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce
PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics
concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we
present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics
for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential
equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively
handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/ysygMhdxw/TEDTrajRec/.

Abstract: Deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical tasks where
predictions must satisfy hard constraints, such as physical laws, fairness
requirements, or safety limits. However, standard architectures lack built-in
mechanisms to enforce such constraints, and existing approaches based on
regularization or projection are often limited to simple constraints,
computationally expensive, or lack feasibility guarantees. This paper proposes
a model-agnostic framework for enforcing input-dependent linear equality and
inequality constraints on neural network outputs. The architecture combines a
task network trained for prediction accuracy with a safe network trained using
decision rules from the stochastic and robust optimization literature to ensure
feasibility across the entire input space. The final prediction is a convex
combination of the two subnetworks, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction during
both training and inference without iterative procedures or runtime
optimization. We prove that the architecture is a universal approximator of
constrained functions and derive computationally tractable formulations based
on linear decision rules. Empirical results on benchmark regression tasks show
that our method consistently satisfies constraints while maintaining
competitive accuracy and low inference latency.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Baguan的新型数据驱动模型，通过自监督预训练和微调方法，有效解决了天气预测中的过拟合问题，并在多种任务中表现优异。

Motivation: 天气预测长期以来是一个重要挑战，传统的数值天气预测方法受限于数据量少，容易过拟合。AI模型虽在全局预测中表现更好，但数据不足仍是一个关键问题。

Method: 采用Siamese Autoencoder进行自监督预训练，通过选择合适的预训练任务引入局部偏差以缓解过拟合，随后对不同预测时间段进行微调。

Result: 实验结果显示，Baguan在中期天气预测中优于传统方法，并能有效控制过拟合，在季节性预测和区域预测等下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过预训练和微调的方法，Baguan模型在天气预测中表现卓越，为解决数据不足和过拟合问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Weather forecasting has long posed a significant challenge for humanity.
While recent AI-based models have surpassed traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods in global forecasting tasks, overfitting remains a
critical issue due to the limited availability of real-world weather data
spanning only a few decades. Unlike fields like computer vision or natural
language processing, where data abundance can mitigate overfitting, weather
forecasting demands innovative strategies to address this challenge with
existing data. In this paper, we explore pre-training methods for weather
forecasting, finding that selecting an appropriately challenging pre-training
task introduces locality bias, effectively mitigating overfitting and enhancing
performance. We introduce Baguan, a novel data-driven model for medium-range
weather forecasting, built on a Siamese Autoencoder pre-trained in a
self-supervised manner and fine-tuned for different lead times. Experimental
results show that Baguan outperforms traditional methods, delivering more
accurate forecasts. Additionally, the pre-trained Baguan demonstrates robust
overfitting control and excels in downstream tasks, such as
subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) modeling and regional forecasting, after
fine-tuning.

TL;DR: InfiFPO是一种新的偏好优化方法，通过合成多源模型概率提升LLM性能，显著优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有模型融合方法在偏好对齐（PA）阶段忽视了概率信息，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出InfiFPO，融合多源模型概率并引入概率剪裁与最大间隔策略。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，InfiFPO将Phi-4的平均性能从79.95提升至83.33。

Conclusion: InfiFPO在数学、编码和推理任务中显著提升LLM能力。

Abstract: Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different
strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training
methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for
enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods
on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs
from source models while discarding their probability information. To address
this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for
implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes
multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex
vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the
probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin
fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human
preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models.
Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO
consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization
methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average
performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its
capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 时间序列预测（TSF）常因历史数据有限而面临不确定性，跨未来行为（CFB）提供了一种新的解决思路。

Method: CRAFT方法包括Koopman预测模块、内部趋势挖掘模块和外部分层趋势引导模块，结合需求约束损失校准预测偏差。

Result: 在离线和在线实验中，CRAFT表现出显著的有效性。

Conclusion: CRAFT通过利用CFB特征和多模块协同，提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: The past decades witness the significant advancements in time series
forecasting (TSF) across various real-world domains, including e-commerce and
disease spread prediction. However, TSF is usually constrained by the
uncertainty dilemma of predicting future data with limited past observations.
To settle this question, we explore the use of Cross-Future Behavior (CFB) in
TSF, which occurs before the current time but takes effect in the future. We
leverage CFB features and propose the CRoss-Future Behavior Awareness based
Time Series Forecasting method (CRAFT). The core idea of CRAFT is to utilize
the trend of cross-future behavior to mine the trend of time series data to be
predicted. Specifically, to settle the sparse and partial flaws of cross-future
behavior, CRAFT employs the Koopman Predictor Module to extract the key trend
and the Internal Trend Mining Module to supplement the unknown area of the
cross-future behavior matrix. Then, we introduce the External Trend Guide
Module with a hierarchical structure to acquire more representative trends from
higher levels. Finally, we apply the demand-constrained loss to calibrate the
distribution deviation of prediction results. We conduct experiments on
real-world dataset. Experiments on both offline large-scale dataset and online
A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAFT. Our dataset and code is
available at https://github.com/CRAFTinTSF/CRAFT.

TL;DR: 研究分析了Llama 3.1和Qwen 3等模型，发现更深层模型并未有效利用深度进行高阶计算，而是将相同计算分散到更多层，解释了性能提升随深度增加而递减的现象。

Motivation: 探讨现代LLM是否通过深度实现了新的高阶计算，还是仅仅将相同计算分散到更多层。

Method: 分析模型的残差流，比较子层输出、跳层影响、多跳任务表现，并通过浅层到深层模型的线性映射测试。

Result: 更深层模型的第二半层贡献较小，跳层影响微弱；多跳任务中未见深度利用；线性映射显示更深模型仅将计算分散到更多层。

Conclusion: 更深模型并未利用深度进行新计算，而是通过更多层进行更精细的残差调整，解释了深度增加带来的收益递减。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance,
albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth
efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations
that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds
of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the
residual stream of the Llama 3.1 and Qwen 3 family of models. We find: First,
comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that
layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half,
with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers
in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output
predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that
models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving
many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using
their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we
train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one.
We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other,
suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over
its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using
their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth
to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain
why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer
architectures.

Result: 数据集重叠和任务重叠均与模型表示相似性呈正相关，结合两者效果最佳。

Conclusion: 数据集和任务的重叠是导致模型表示相似性的重要因素，尤其是二者的结合。

Abstract: Numerous works have noted significant similarities in how machine learning
models represent the world, even across modalities. Although much effort has
been devoted to uncovering properties and metrics on which these models align,
surprisingly little work has explored causes of this similarity. To advance
this line of inquiry, this work explores how two possible causal factors --
dataset overlap and task overlap -- influence downstream model similarity. The
exploration of dataset overlap is motivated by the reality that large-scale
generative AI models are often trained on overlapping datasets of scraped
internet data, while the exploration of task overlap seeks to substantiate
claims from a recent work, the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, that task
similarity may drive model similarity. We evaluate the effects of both factors
through a broad set of experiments. We find that both positively correlate with
higher representational similarity and that combining them provides the
strongest effect. Our code and dataset are published.

Method: 通过注入微小参数扰动和跟踪经验神经切向核（eNTK）的演化，分析网络对扰动的响应和功能轨迹。

Result: 发现早期混沌效应和后期锥形效应，表明网络从对初始条件高度敏感的混沌状态过渡到稳定状态。

Conclusion: 两种效应提供了深度学习训练过程中从探索到稳定的动态结构视角。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks learn remains a fundamental challenge
in modern machine learning. A growing body of evidence suggests that training
dynamics undergo a distinct phase transition, yet our understanding of this
transition is still incomplete. In this paper, we introduce an interval-wise
perspective that compares network states across a time window, revealing two
new phenomena that illuminate the two-phase nature of deep learning. i)
\textbf{The Chaos Effect.} By injecting an imperceptibly small parameter
perturbation at various stages, we show that the response of the network to the
perturbation exhibits a transition from chaotic to stable, suggesting there is
an early critical period where the network is highly sensitive to initial
conditions; ii) \textbf{The Cone Effect.} Tracking the evolution of the
empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (eNTK), we find that after this transition
point the model's functional trajectory is confined to a narrow cone-shaped
subset: while the kernel continues to change, it gets trapped into a tight
angular region. Together, these effects provide a structural, dynamical view of
how deep networks transition from sensitive exploration to stable refinement
during training.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于插入范式的新型学习方法L2C-Insert，用于解决车辆路径问题，相比传统顺序追加方法，显著提高了解决方案的灵活性和质量。

Motivation: 现有基于神经网络组合优化的方法通常采用顺序追加节点的范式，导致解决方案质量不佳。论文探索插入范式以克服这一限制。

Method: 提出L2C-Insert方法，通过策略性地将未访问节点插入当前部分解的任意有效位置，并引入模型架构、训练方案和推理技术三个关键组件。

Result: 在TSP和CVRP的合成和真实实例中，L2C-Insert在多种问题规模上均表现出更优的性能。

Conclusion: 插入范式的引入显著提升了神经网络组合优化在车辆路径问题中的表现。

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimisation (NCO) is a promising learning-based
approach for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) without extensive manual
design. While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an
appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial
solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome
this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose
Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel
learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches,
L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any
valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance
the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three
key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position
prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an
advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's
flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances
of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior
performance across various problem sizes.

Conclusion: COUPLE通过图扩散和渐进对齐显著提升了无监督域自适应检索的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval aims to transfer knowledge
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, while maintaining
low storage cost and high retrieval efficiency. However, existing methods
typically fail to address potential noise in the target domain, and directly
align high-level features across domains, thus resulting in suboptimal
retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Cross-Domain Diffusion with Progressive Alignment method (COUPLE). This
approach revisits unsupervised efficient domain adaptive retrieval from a graph
diffusion perspective, simulating cross-domain adaptation dynamics to achieve a
stable target domain adaptation process. First, we construct a cross-domain
relationship graph and leverage noise-robust graph flow diffusion to simulate
the transfer dynamics from the source domain to the target domain, identifying
lower noise clusters. We then leverage the graph diffusion results for
discriminative hash code learning, effectively learning from the target domain
while reducing the negative impact of noise. Furthermore, we employ a
hierarchical Mixup operation for progressive domain alignment, which is
performed along the cross-domain random walk paths. Utilizing target domain
discriminative hash learning and progressive domain alignment, COUPLE enables
effective domain adaptive hash learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
COUPLE's effectiveness on competitive benchmarks.

Method: 提出ShortcutProbe框架，通过识别潜在空间中的预测捷径并重新训练模型以提升鲁棒性。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，该方法能有效提升模型对伪偏置的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ShortcutProbe是一种高效且实用的工具，可改善模型在不同数据集中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning models often achieve high performance by inadvertently learning
spurious correlations between targets and non-essential features. For example,
an image classifier may identify an object via its background that spuriously
correlates with it. This prediction behavior, known as spurious bias, severely
degrades model performance on data that lacks the learned spurious
correlations. Existing methods on spurious bias mitigation typically require a
variety of data groups with spurious correlation annotations called group
labels. However, group labels require costly human annotations and often fail
to capture subtle spurious biases such as relying on specific pixels for
predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel post hoc spurious bias
mitigation framework without requiring group labels. Our framework, termed
ShortcutProbe, identifies prediction shortcuts that reflect potential
non-robustness in predictions in a given model's latent space. The model is
then retrained to be invariant to the identified prediction shortcuts for
improved robustness. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the
framework and empirically demonstrate that it is an efficient and practical
tool for improving a model's robustness to spurious bias on diverse datasets.

Abstract: World models predict state transitions in response to actions and are
increasingly developed across diverse modalities. However, standard training
objectives such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) often misalign with
task-specific goals of world models, i.e., transition prediction metrics like
accuracy or perceptual quality. In this paper, we present RLVR-World, a unified
framework that leverages reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
to directly optimize world models for such metrics. Despite formulating world
modeling as autoregressive prediction of tokenized sequences, RLVR-World
evaluates metrics of decoded predictions as verifiable rewards. We demonstrate
substantial performance gains on both language- and video-based world models
across domains, including text games, web navigation, and robot manipulation.
Our work indicates that, beyond recent advances in reasoning language models,
RLVR offers a promising post-training paradigm for enhancing the utility of
generative models more broadly.

TL;DR: VAMO是一种结合一阶和零阶梯度优化的方差减少方法，用于高效解决大规模非凸问题，在收敛速度和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Motivation: 大规模非凸优化问题在机器学习中常见，但现有的一阶方法计算成本高，而零阶方法收敛慢。VAMO旨在平衡这两者。

Method: VAMO结合了一阶小批量梯度和轻量级零阶有限差分探测，在SVRG框架下设计了一种混合梯度优化方法。

Result: 实验表明，VAMO在传统神经网络训练和LLM微调中均表现优异，收敛速率不受维度影响，优于SGD和纯零阶方法。

Conclusion: VAMO为计算受限场景提供了一种高效、灵活的优化方案。

Abstract: Optimizing large-scale nonconvex problems, common in machine learning,
demands balancing rapid convergence with computational efficiency. First-order
(FO) stochastic methods like SVRG provide fast convergence and good
generalization but incur high costs due to full-batch gradients in large
models. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) algorithms reduce this burden using
estimated gradients, yet their slow convergence in high-dimensional settings
limits practicality. We introduce VAMO (VAriance-reduced Mixed-gradient
Optimizer), a stochastic variance-reduced method combining FO mini-batch
gradients with lightweight ZO finite-difference probes under an SVRG-style
framework. VAMO's hybrid design uses a two-point ZO estimator to achieve a
dimension-agnostic convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T + 1/b)$, where $T$ is
the number of iterations and $b$ is the batch-size, surpassing the
dimension-dependent slowdown of purely ZO methods and significantly improving
over SGD's $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate. Additionally, we propose a
multi-point ZO variant that mitigates the $O(1/b)$ error by adjusting number of
estimation points to balance convergence and cost, making it ideal for a whole
range of computationally constrained scenarios. Experiments including
traditional neural network training and LLM finetuning show VAMO outperforms
established FO and ZO methods, offering a faster, more flexible option for
improved efficiency.

Abstract: To enhance the reliability and credibility of graph neural networks (GNNs)
and improve the transparency of their decision logic, a new field of
explainability of GNNs (XGNN) has emerged. However, two major limitations
severely degrade the performance and hinder the generalizability of existing
XGNN methods: they (a) fail to capture the complete decision logic of GNNs
across diverse distributions in the entire dataset's sample space, and (b)
impose strict prerequisites on edge properties and GNN internal accessibility.
To address these limitations, we propose OPEN, a novel c\textbf{O}mprehensive
and \textbf{P}rerequisite-free \textbf{E}xplainer for G\textbf{N}Ns. OPEN, as
the first work in the literature, can infer and partition the entire dataset's
sample space into multiple environments, each containing graphs that follow a
distinct distribution. OPEN further learns the decision logic of GNNs across
different distributions by sampling subgraphs from each environment and
analyzing their predictions, thus eliminating the need for strict
prerequisites. Experimental results demonstrate that OPEN captures nearly
complete decision logic of GNNs, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
fidelity while maintaining similar efficiency, and enhances robustness in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Existing research on judicial sentencing prediction predominantly relies on
end-to-end models, which often neglect the inherent sentencing logic and lack
interpretability-a critical requirement for both scholarly research and
judicial practice. To address this challenge, we make three key
contributions:First, we propose a novel Saturated Mechanistic Sentencing (SMS)
model, which provides inherent legal interpretability by virtue of its
foundation in China's Criminal Law. We also introduce the corresponding
Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) adaptive algorithm for this model. Second,
for the MLMS algorithm based adaptive sentencing predictor, we establish a
mathematical theory on the accuracy of adaptive prediction without resorting to
any stationarity and independence assumptions on the data. We also provide a
best possible upper bound for the prediction accuracy achievable by the best
predictor designed in the known parameters case. Third, we construct a Chinese
Intentional Bodily Harm (CIBH) dataset. Utilizing this real-world data,
extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a prediction
accuracy that is not far from the best possible theoretical upper bound,
validating both the model's suitability and the algorithm's accuracy.

limitations of existing mean field-based approaches. Based on this framework,
we derive (empirically tight) upper bounds of $\ell_q$ norm-based adversarial
loss with $\ell_p$ norm-based adversarial examples for various values of $p$
and $q$. Moreover, we prove that networks without shortcuts are generally not
adversarially trainable and that adversarial training reduces network capacity.
We also show that network width alleviates these issues. Furthermore, we
present the various impacts of the input and output dimensions on the upper
bounds and time evolution of the weight variance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FedGraM的新型联邦学习鲁棒聚合方法，通过辅助数据集和Gram矩阵范数检测并移除未目标攻击，显著提升了模型在数据隐私保护下的安全性。

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）易受未目标攻击影响，现有防御机制因数据异构性在实用环境中效果有限。作者旨在通过检测和移除攻击来减轻其影响。

Method: 提出FedGraM方法，服务器使用辅助数据集（每类一个样本）提取本地模型嵌入，计算Gram矩阵范数以衡量模型嵌入空间的类间分离能力，过滤范数最大的潜在恶意模型。

Result: 实验表明，FedGraM在有限数据下性能卓越，优于现有防御方法。

Conclusion: FedGraM通过嵌入空间分析和Gram矩阵范数检测攻击，有效提升了FL的抗攻击能力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables geographically distributed clients to
collaboratively train machine learning models by sharing only their local
models, ensuring data privacy. However, FL is vulnerable to untargeted attacks
that aim to degrade the global model's performance on the underlying data
distribution. Existing defense mechanisms attempt to improve FL's resilience
against such attacks, but their effectiveness is limited in practical FL
environments due to data heterogeneity. On the contrary, we aim to detect and
remove the attacks to mitigate their impact. Generalization contribution plays
a crucial role in distinguishing untargeted attacks. Our observations indicate
that, with limited data, the divergence between embeddings representing
different classes provides a better measure of generalization than direct
accuracy. In light of this, we propose a novel robust aggregation method,
FedGraM, designed to defend against untargeted attacks in FL. The server
maintains an auxiliary dataset containing one sample per class to support
aggregation. This dataset is fed to the local models to extract embeddings.
Then, the server calculates the norm of the Gram Matrix of the embeddings for
each local model. The norm serves as an indicator of each model's inter-class
separation capability in the embedding space. FedGraM identifies and removes
potentially malicious models by filtering out those with the largest norms,
then averages the remaining local models to form the global model. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of FedGraM. Our empirical
results show that with limited data samples used to construct the auxiliary
dataset, FedGraM achieves exceptional performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art defense methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的CPF方法，通过结合图级和节点级过滤，解决异质图分类问题，避免过度参数化。

Motivation: 传统图级过滤难以处理异质图，而节点级过滤可能过度参数化，需要统一框架优化。

Method: 引入CPF方法，通过结构感知和特征感知的分区过滤，结合图粗化和k均值聚类。

Result: CPF在节点分类和图异常检测任务中表现优异，优于其他范式。

Conclusion: CPF提供了一种有效统一的过滤框架，适用于同质和异质图任务。

Abstract: Filtering-based graph neural networks (GNNs) constitute a distinct class of
GNNs that employ graph filters to handle graph-structured data, achieving
notable success in various graph-related tasks. Conventional methods adopt a
graph-wise filtering paradigm, imposing a uniform filter across all nodes, yet
recent findings suggest that this rigid paradigm struggles with heterophilic
graphs. To overcome this, recent works have introduced node-wise filtering,
which assigns distinct filters to individual nodes, offering enhanced
adaptability. However, a fundamental gap remains: a comprehensive framework
unifying these two strategies is still absent, limiting theoretical insights
into the filtering paradigms. Moreover, through the lens of Contextual
Stochastic Block Model, we reveal that a synthesis of graph-wise and node-wise
filtering provides a sufficient solution for classification on graphs
exhibiting both homophily and heterophily, suggesting the risk of excessive
parameterization and potential overfitting with node-wise filtering. To address
the limitations, this paper introduces Coarsening-guided Partition-wise
Filtering (CPF). CPF innovates by performing filtering on node partitions. The
method begins with structure-aware partition-wise filtering, which filters node
partitions obtained via graph coarsening algorithms, and then performs
feature-aware partition-wise filtering, refining node embeddings via filtering
on clusters produced by $k$-means clustering over features. In-depth analysis
is conducted for each phase of CPF, showing its superiority over other
paradigms. Finally, benchmark node classification experiments, along with a
real-world graph anomaly detection application, validate CPF's efficacy and
practical utility.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在推理时固定降噪调度的问题，无法根据实例难度或任务需求动态分配计算资源。

Method: 提出Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD)框架，包含循环扩散搜索、自动探索-利用平衡和自适应思考时间。

Result: 实验表明ABCD在多种任务中提升性能的同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: ABCD为动态调整推理计算提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
domains ranging from image synthesis to complex reasoning tasks. However, most
inference-time scaling methods rely on fixed denoising schedules, limiting
their ability to allocate computation based on instance difficulty or
task-specific demands adaptively. We introduce the challenge of adaptive
inference-time scaling-dynamically adjusting computational effort during
inference-and propose Adaptive Bi-directional Cyclic Diffusion (ABCD), a
flexible, search-based inference framework. ABCD refines outputs through
bi-directional diffusion cycles while adaptively controlling exploration depth
and termination. It comprises three components: Cyclic Diffusion Search,
Automatic Exploration-Exploitation Balancing, and Adaptive Thinking Time.
Experiments show that ABCD improves performance across diverse tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FNO能够有效捕捉高维多尺度动力学系统的复杂行为，为离子模型的近似提供了一种可靠工具。

Abstract: Ionic models, described by systems of stiff ordinary differential equations,
are fundamental tools for simulating the complex dynamics of excitable cells in
both Computational Neuroscience and Cardiology. Approximating these models
using Artificial Neural Networks poses significant challenges due to their
inherent stiffness, multiscale nonlinearities, and the wide range of dynamical
behaviors they exhibit, including multiple equilibrium points, limit cycles,
and intricate interactions. While in previous studies the dynamics of the
transmembrane potential has been predicted in low dimensionality settings, in
the present study we extend these results by investigating whether Fourier
Neural Operators can effectively learn the evolution of all the state variables
within these dynamical systems in higher dimensions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach by accurately learning the dynamics of three
well-established ionic models with increasing dimensionality: the two-variable
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, the four-variable Hodgkin-Huxley model, and the
forty-one-variable O'Hara-Rudy model. To ensure the selection of near-optimal
configurations for the Fourier Neural Operator, we conducted automatic
hyperparameter tuning under two scenarios: an unconstrained setting, where the
number of trainable parameters is not limited, and a constrained case with a
fixed number of trainable parameters. Both constrained and unconstrained
architectures achieve comparable results in terms of accuracy across all the
models considered. However, the unconstrained architecture required
approximately half the number of training epochs to achieve similar error
levels, as evidenced by the loss function values recorded during training.
These results underline the capabilities of Fourier Neural Operators to
accurately capture complex multiscale dynamics, even in high-dimensional
dynamical systems.

Motivation: 现有模型引导方法缺乏理论基础，导致性能不佳，本文旨在填补这一空白并提供理论支持。

Method: 基于分布鲁棒优化（DRO）提出DRRho风险最小化框架，并扩展至CLIP任务，提出DRRho-CLIP方法。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，该方法显著提升泛化能力和数据效率，且优于现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: DRRho框架为模型引导提供了理论依据，并在实践中表现出色，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model
as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through
strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While
ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of
large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a
theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk
minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why
this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training
without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which
significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering.
Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and
DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments
validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to
CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing
heuristic approaches.

Motivation: 现有图结构学习方法（如GNNs、GATs）依赖原始图结构，性能在稀疏或含噪情况下下降，且聚类方法未能充分捕捉节点间关系。

Method: DeSE通过深度结构熵量化结构信息，结合结构学习层（SLL）生成属性图优化原始图，并基于GNN的聚类分配方法（ASS）学习节点嵌入。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于八种基线方法，证明了DeSE的有效性和可解释性。

Conclusion: DeSE通过结构熵和深度学习改进图聚类，解决了图稀疏性和噪声问题。

Abstract: Research on Graph Structure Learning (GSL) provides key insights for
graph-based clustering, yet current methods like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and contrastive learning often rely heavily on
the original graph structure. Their performance deteriorates when the original
graph's adjacency matrix is too sparse or contains noisy edges unrelated to
clustering. Moreover, these methods depend on learning node embeddings and
using traditional techniques like k-means to form clusters, which may not fully
capture the underlying graph structure between nodes. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces DeSE, a novel unsupervised graph clustering
framework incorporating Deep Structural Entropy. It enhances the original graph
with quantified structural information and deep neural networks to form
clusters. Specifically, we first propose a method for calculating structural
entropy with soft assignment, which quantifies structure in a differentiable
form. Next, we design a Structural Learning layer (SLL) to generate an
attributed graph from the original feature data, serving as a target to enhance
and optimize the original structural graph, thereby mitigating the issue of
sparse connections between graph nodes. Finally, our clustering assignment
method (ASS), based on GNNs, learns node embeddings and a soft assignment
matrix to cluster on the enhanced graph. The ASS layer can be stacked to meet
downstream task requirements, minimizing structural entropy for stable
clustering and maximizing node consistency with edge-based cross-entropy loss.
Extensive comparative experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets
against eight representative unsupervised graph clustering baselines,
demonstrating the superiority of the DeSE in both effectiveness and
interpretability.

Method: 通过对抗预训练Transformer模型，并在多任务上使用上下文学习，无需参数更新即可实现鲁棒性。

Result: 对抗预训练的Transformer能够聚焦于鲁棒特征，抵抗攻击，并在未见任务中表现良好。但存在局限性，如准确性与鲁棒性的权衡。

Conclusion: 对抗预训练Transformer可以作为鲁棒基础模型，减少对抗训练的需求，但需注意其局限性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but
it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we show that transformers
adversarially pretrained on diverse tasks can serve as robust foundation models
and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks.
Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a
single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple
unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter
updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and
its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these
positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain
conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer
transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an
accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context
demonstrations. The code is available at

Result: 在粗粒度和细粒度数据集上，MTMC提升了聚类精度和类别数量估计，增强了类间可分性。

Conclusion: MTMC是提升开放世界学习鲁棒性的关键，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is essential for improving deep learning
models' robustness in open-world scenarios by clustering unlabeled data
containing both known and novel categories. Traditional GCD methods focus on
minimizing intra-cluster variations, often sacrificing manifold capacity, which
limits the richness of intra-class representations. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach, Maximum Token Manifold Capacity (MTMC), that prioritizes
maximizing the manifold capacity of class tokens to preserve the diversity and
complexity of data. MTMC leverages the nuclear norm of singular values as a
measure of manifold capacity, ensuring that the representation of samples
remains informative and well-structured. This method enhances the
discriminability of clusters, allowing the model to capture detailed semantic
features and avoid the loss of critical information during clustering. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on coarse- and fine-grained
datasets, we demonstrate that MTMC outperforms existing GCD methods, improving
both clustering accuracy and the estimation of category numbers. The
integration of MTMC leads to more complete representations, better inter-class
separability, and a reduction in dimensional collapse, establishing MTMC as a
vital component for robust open-world learning. Code is in

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）目前缺乏像文本大语言模型（LLMs）那样的有效引导方法。本文旨在探索是否可以通过文本LLM的引导向量来提升MLLMs的性能。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）、均值漂移（mean shift）和线性探测（linear probing）从文本LLM中提取引导向量，并将其应用于MLLMs。

Result: 文本引导显著提升了MLLMs在多任务中的准确度，均值漂移在空间关系任务中表现尤为突出（CV-Bench上提升+7.3%），并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 文本引导向量是提升MLLMs性能的高效工具，且无需额外数据或计算资源。

Abstract: Steering methods have emerged as effective and targeted tools for guiding
large language models' (LLMs) behavior without modifying their parameters.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the
same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural
diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered
using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing. We find that text-derived
steering consistently enhances multimodal accuracy across diverse MLLM
architectures and visual tasks. In particular, mean shift boosts spatial
relationship accuracy on CV-Bench by up to +7.3% and counting accuracy by up to
+3.3%, outperforming prompting and exhibiting strong generalization to
out-of-distribution datasets. These results highlight textual steering vectors
as a powerful, efficient mechanism for enhancing grounding in MLLMs with
minimal additional data collection and computational overhead.

locked to model parameters, hindering its reusability and scalability. To this
end, we propose CoOpt, a highly efficient, parallelized framework for
collaborative unlabeled data optimization, thereby effectively encoding
knowledge into the data itself. By distributing unlabeled data and leveraging
publicly available task-agnostic models, CoOpt facilitates scalable, reusable,
and sustainable training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and architectures demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency, achieving
13.6% and 6.8% improvements on Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1K, respectively,
with training speedups of $1.94 \times $ and $1.2 \times$.

Abstract: This study investigates the multifaceted factors influencing wildfire risk in
Iran, focusing on the interplay between climatic conditions and human
activities. Utilizing advanced remote sensing, geospatial information system
(GIS) processing techniques such as cloud computing, and machine learning
algorithms, this research analyzed the impact of climatic parameters,
topographic features, and human-related factors on wildfire susceptibility
assessment and prediction in Iran. Multiple scenarios were developed for this
purpose based on the data sampling strategy. The findings revealed that
climatic elements such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
significantly contribute to wildfire susceptibility, while human
activities-particularly population density and proximity to powerlines-also
played a crucial role. Furthermore, the seasonal impact of each parameter was
separately assessed during warm and cold seasons. The results indicated that
human-related factors, rather than climatic variables, had a more prominent
influence during the seasonal analyses. This research provided new insights
into wildfire dynamics in Iran by generating high-resolution wildfire
susceptibility maps using advanced machine learning classifiers. The generated
maps identified high risk areas, particularly in the central Zagros region, the
northeastern Hyrcanian Forest, and the northern Arasbaran forest, highlighting
the urgent need for effective fire management strategies.

Abstract: Biological brains learn continually from a stream of unlabeled data, while
integrating specialized information from sparsely labeled examples without
compromising their ability to generalize. Meanwhile, machine learning methods
are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in this natural learning setting, as
supervised specialist fine-tuning degrades performance on the original task. We
introduce task-modulated contrastive learning (TMCL), which takes inspiration
from the biophysical machinery in the neocortex, using predictive coding
principles to integrate top-down information continually and without
supervision. We follow the idea that these principles build a view-invariant
representation space, and that this can be implemented using a contrastive
loss. Then, whenever labeled samples of a new class occur, new affine
modulations are learned that improve separation of the new class from all
others, without affecting feedforward weights. By co-opting the view-invariance
learning mechanism, we then train feedforward weights to match the unmodulated
representation of a data sample to its modulated counterparts. This introduces
modulation invariance into the representation space, and, by also using past
modulations, stabilizes it. Our experiments show improvements in both
class-incremental and transfer learning over state-of-the-art unsupervised
approaches, as well as over comparable supervised approaches, using as few as
1% of available labels. Taken together, our work suggests that top-down
modulations play a crucial role in balancing stability and plasticity.

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in the
field of education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies
between KCs. An accurate KC graph can assist educators in identifying the root
causes of learners' poor performance on specific KCs, thereby enabling targeted
instructional interventions. To achieve this, we have developed a KC graph
structure learning algorithm, named MAS-KCL, which employs a multi-agent system
driven by large language models for adaptive modification and optimization of
the KC graph. Additionally, a bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated
into the algorithm, where AI agents leverage this mechanism to assess the value
of edges within the KC graph and adjust the distribution of generation
probabilities for different edges, thereby accelerating the efficiency of
structure learning. We applied the proposed algorithm to 5 synthetic datasets
and 4 real-world educational datasets, and experimental results validate its
effectiveness in learning path recognition. By accurately identifying learners'
learning paths, teachers are able to design more comprehensive learning plans,
enabling learners to achieve their educational goals more effectively, thus
promoting the sustainable development of education.

Result: SLAM在模拟和真实空间转录组数据中表现优于其他评估指标，全面反映标注质量。

Conclusion: SLAM为空间标注相似性提供了一种全面、无偏的测量方法。

Abstract: Spatial labeling assigns labels to specific spatial locations to characterize
their spatial properties and relationships, with broad applications in
scientific research and practice. Measuring the similarity between two spatial
labelings is essential for understanding their differences and the contributing
factors, such as changes in location properties or labeling methods. An
adequate and unbiased measurement of spatial labeling similarity should
consider the number of matched labels (label agreement), the topology of
spatial label distribution, and the heterogeneous impacts of mismatched labels.
However, existing methods often fail to account for all these aspects. To
address this gap, we propose a methodological framework to guide the
development of methods that meet these requirements. Given two spatial
labelings, the framework transforms them into graphs based on location
organization, labels, and attributes (e.g., location significance). The
distributions of their graph attributes are then extracted, enabling an
efficient computation of distributional discrepancy to reflect the
dissimilarity level between the two labelings. We further provide a concrete
implementation of this framework, termed Spatial Labeling Analogy Metric
(SLAM), along with an analysis of its theoretical foundation, for evaluating
spatial labeling results in spatial transcriptomics (ST) \textit{as per} their
similarity with ground truth labeling. Through a series of carefully designed
experimental cases involving both simulated and real ST data, we demonstrate
that SLAM provides a comprehensive and accurate reflection of labeling quality
compared to other well-established evaluation metrics. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TTMM通过模型合并将MoE扩展到更多专家，近似测试时训练（TTT），性能接近TTT但计算成本低100倍。

Motivation: 解决当前MoE模型因训练和推理成本高而只能使用少量专家的问题，提供一种成本效益高的测试时训练扩展方法。

Method: 提出测试时模型合并（TTMM），利用模型合并减少测试时开销，并通过更多专家提升性能。

Result: TTMM性能随专家数量增加而提升，接近TTT，且1B参数模型下测试时速度快100倍。

Conclusion: TTMM是一种高效、成本低的测试时训练扩展方法，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: Mixture of expert (MoE) models are a promising approach to increasing model
capacity without increasing inference cost, and are core components of many
state-of-the-art language models. However, current MoE models typically use
only few experts due to prohibitive training and inference cost. We propose
Test-Time Model Merging (TTMM) which scales the MoE paradigm to an order of
magnitude more experts and uses model merging to avoid almost any test-time
overhead. We show that TTMM is an approximation of test-time training (TTT),
which fine-tunes an expert model for each prediction task, i.e., prompt. TTT
has recently been shown to significantly improve language models, but is
computationally expensive. We find that performance of TTMM improves with more
experts and approaches the performance of TTT. Moreover, we find that with a 1B
parameter base model, TTMM is more than 100x faster than TTT at test-time by
amortizing the cost of TTT at train-time. Thus, TTMM offers a promising
cost-effective approach to scale test-time training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为能量引导流匹配的新方法，用于增强流模型的训练，并消除了推理时的引导需求。该方法通过学习条件速度场和近似高斯路径来优化策略训练，并在离线强化学习中展示了竞争力。

Motivation: 目前在扩散模型中，如何在训练阶段引入引导仍是一个较少探索的问题。本文旨在通过能量引导流匹配改进训练过程，同时避免推理时的额外引导需求。

Method: 作者提出了能量引导流匹配方法，通过近似高斯路径学习条件速度场，并将其应用于离线强化学习算法FlowQ中。该方法优化了策略训练的时间复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，FlowQ在性能上具有竞争力，同时策略训练时间与流采样步骤数无关。

Conclusion: 能量引导流匹配是一种有效的训练方法，尤其适用于目标分布由数据和能量函数共同定义的任务，如强化学习。

Abstract: The use of guidance to steer sampling toward desired outcomes has been widely
explored within diffusion models, especially in applications such as image and
trajectory generation. However, incorporating guidance during training remains
relatively underexplored. In this work, we introduce energy-guided flow
matching, a novel approach that enhances the training of flow models and
eliminates the need for guidance at inference time. We learn a conditional
velocity field corresponding to the flow policy by approximating an
energy-guided probability path as a Gaussian path. Learning guided trajectories
is appealing for tasks where the target distribution is defined by a
combination of data and an energy function, as in reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-based policies have recently attracted attention for their expressive
power and ability to capture multi-modal action distributions. Typically, these
policies are optimized using weighted objectives or by back-propagating
gradients through actions sampled by the policy. As an alternative, we propose
FlowQ, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm based on energy-guided flow
matching. Our method achieves competitive performance while the policy training
time is constant in the number of flow sampling steps.

TL;DR: FedWBA是一种新型的个性化贝叶斯联邦学习方法，通过非参数化后验表示和基于Wasserstein重心聚合，解决了现有方法在后验推断和参数聚合中的限制。

Motivation: 现有PBFL方法存在参数化假设和简单平均聚合的局限性，FedWBA旨在提升本地推断和全局聚合的效果。

Method: 使用基于粒子的变分推断进行非参数化后验表示，并在服务器端引入Wasserstein重心聚合。

Result: 理论上证明本地变分推断和全局聚合的收敛性，实验显示FedWBA在准确性、不确定性校准和收敛速度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FedWBA在个性化贝叶斯联邦学习中表现出优越性，并具有稳健性。

Abstract: Personalized Bayesian federated learning (PBFL) handles non-i.i.d. client
data and quantifies uncertainty by combining personalization with Bayesian
inference. However, existing PBFL methods face two limitations: restrictive
parametric assumptions in client posterior inference and naive parameter
averaging for server aggregation. To overcome these issues, we propose FedWBA,
a novel PBFL method that enhances both local inference and global aggregation.
At the client level, we use particle-based variational inference for
nonparametric posterior representation. At the server level, we introduce
particle-based Wasserstein barycenter aggregation, offering a more
geometrically meaningful approach. Theoretically, we provide local and global
convergence guarantees for FedWBA. Locally, we prove a KL divergence decrease
lower bound per iteration for variational inference convergence. Globally, we
show that the Wasserstein barycenter converges to the true parameter as the
client data size increases. Empirically, experiments show that FedWBA
outperforms baselines in prediction accuracy, uncertainty calibration, and
convergence rate, with ablation studies confirming its robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GraNT的新范式，通过非参数教学视角重新解释图结构的属性学习过程，显著提升了GCN的训练效率，同时保持了泛化性能。

Motivation: 学习图结构数据属性（如分子溶解度）的隐式映射通常代价高昂，需要解决GCN训练中的效率问题。

Method: GraNT通过非参数教学框架，选择示例子集来加速GCN训练，并将GCN的参数更新重新解释为功能梯度下降。

Result: GraNT在图级回归、分类及节点级回归、分类任务中分别减少了36.62%、38.19%、30.97%和47.30%的训练时间，且保持泛化性能。

Conclusion: GraNT展示了非参数教学与结构敏感学习的一致性，显著提升了图属性学习器的效率。

Abstract: Inferring properties of graph-structured data, e.g., the solubility of
molecules, essentially involves learning the implicit mapping from graphs to
their properties. This learning process is often costly for graph property
learners like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). To address this, we propose
a paradigm called Graph Neural Teaching (GraNT) that reinterprets the learning
process through a novel nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the
latter offers a theoretical framework for teaching implicitly defined (i.e.,
nonparametric) mappings via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is
realized by a dense set of graph-property pairs, with the GraNT teacher
selecting a subset of them to promote faster convergence in GCN training. By
analytically examining the impact of graph structure on parameter-based
gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of GCNs--shaped
by parameter updates--through functional gradient descent in nonparametric
teaching, we show for the first time that teaching graph property learners
(i.e., GCNs) is consistent with teaching structure-aware nonparametric
learners. These new findings readily commit GraNT to enhancing learning
efficiency of the graph property learner, showing significant reductions in
training time for graph-level regression (-36.62%), graph-level classification
(-38.19%), node-level regression (-30.97%) and node-level classification
(-47.30%), all while maintaining its generalization performance.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）安全对齐的几何视角，发现安全行为与不安全行为在子空间中相互交织，挑战了局部对齐的假设。

Motivation: 研究旨在验证安全对齐是否可以通过几何方向隔离或保留，以防御微调导致的安全退化。

Method: 通过对参数和激活空间的全面实证研究，分析安全行为是否集中在特定子空间及其与通用学习的分离性。

Result: 结果显示安全与不安全行为在子空间中重叠，并未发现选择性控制安全的独立子空间。

Conclusion: 安全对齐并非几何局部化，而是源自模型学习动力学的复杂交互，表明基于子空间的防御策略存在根本局限。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to produce socially
acceptable responses. This is typically achieved through instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, this alignment is known to
be brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data,
can degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work
suggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable geometric directions in
weight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or
preserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive empirical study of this geometric perspective. We examine whether
safety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific subspaces, whether it can
be separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from
distinguishable patterns in internal representations. Across both parameter and
activation space, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe
behaviors also amplify unsafe ones, and prompts with different safety
implications activate overlapping representations. We find no evidence of a
subspace that selectively governs safety. These results challenge the
assumption that alignment is geometrically localized. Rather than residing in
distinct directions, safety appears to emerge from entangled, high-impact
components of the model's broader learning dynamics. This suggests that
subspace-based defenses may face fundamental limitations and underscores the
need for alternative strategies to preserve alignment under continued training.
We corroborate these findings through multiple experiments on five open-source
LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了α-GAN，一种基于Rényi测度的生成对抗网络，通过Rényi交叉熵构建价值函数，解决了传统GAN训练中的一些问题。

Motivation: 现有GAN在训练中常遇到梯度消失等问题，论文希望通过引入Rényi测度和调整α值，改善训练效率和稳定性。

Method: 使用Rényi交叉熵作为价值函数，通过α参数调节梯度大小，形成生成器和判别器的min-max问题。

Result: 实验表明，当α∈(0,1)时，梯度被指数放大，收敛速度加快，并可能解决梯度消失问题。

Conclusion: α-GAN在特定α范围内表现优于传统GAN，且尚未被充分探索，具有潜力解决GAN训练的常见问题。

Abstract: This paper proposes $\alpha$-GAN, a generative adversarial network using
R\'{e}nyi measures. The value function is formulated, by R\'{e}nyi cross
entropy, as an expected certainty measure incurred by the discriminator's soft
decision as to where the sample is from, true population or the generator. The
discriminator tries to maximize the R\'{e}nyi certainty about sample source,
while the generator wants to reduce it by injecting fake samples. This forms a
min-max problem with the solution parameterized by the R\'{e}nyi order
$\alpha$. This $\alpha$-GAN reduces to vanilla GAN at $\alpha = 1$, where the
value function is exactly the binary cross entropy. The optimization of
$\alpha$-GAN is over probability (vector) space. It is shown that the gradient
is exponentially enlarged when R\'{e}nyi order is in the range $\alpha \in
(0,1)$. This makes convergence faster, which is verified by experimental
results. A discussion shows that choosing $\alpha \in (0,1)$ may be able to
solve some common problems, e.g., vanishing gradient. A following observation
reveals that this range has not been fully explored in the existing R\'{e}nyi
version GANs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的FlashAttention内核FLASH-D，通过简化数学公式隐藏softmax除法并减少计算成本，同时保持了原有内核的高效特性，硬件实现显示出显著的性能提升。

Motivation: 传统transformer注意力机制中的softmax计算导致计算效率低下，FlashAttention虽然已优化GPU计算，但仍需进一步简化和提升硬件效率。

Method: 重新评估FlashAttention内核，提出FLASH-D，通过隐藏softmax除法和稳定计算指数来简化公式，同时减少计算成本。

Result: FLASH-D在28nm硬件实现中平均减少了22.8%的面积和20.3%的功耗，且无性能损失。

Conclusion: FLASH-D在保持FlashAttention高效特性的同时，显著提升了硬件效率。

Abstract: The transformer's attention mechanism has revolutionized AI and machine
learning, with its efficient computation being crucial to its performance.
However, calculating attention involves matrix operations interspersed with
softmax rescaling, which inherently slows down computation and requires
processing the entire input sequence. Building on online softmax computation,
FlashAttention integrates softmax calculation with matrix arithmetic, enabling
tiled computation independent of sequence length. While optimized for GPUs,
FlashAttention's simplicity makes it amenable to direct hardware acceleration.
This work re-evaluates the core FlashAttention kernel, presenting FLASH-D a
mathematically equivalent, yet simplified, formulation that achieves: (a)
hiding softmax division within other non-linear function evaluations; (b)
inherently numerically stable computation of exponentials, eliminating the need
for maximum value subtraction; and (c) a reduction in computational cost
without introducing numerical approximations to the FlashAttention kernel.
Importantly, the essential FlashAttention properties that facilitate efficient
tiled implementation are fully preserved. Hardware implementation results at
28nm demonstrate that this proposed formulation achieves a 22.8% reduction in
area and a 20.3% reduction in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art
parallel hardware architectures without any performance penalty.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多尺度离散Transformer（MSDformer）方法，用于解决现有DTM方法无法捕捉多尺度时间模式和缺乏理论基础的局限性，显著提升了时间序列生成的质量。

Motivation: 现有的DTM方法无法捕捉复杂时间数据中的多尺度时间模式，且缺乏理论基础指导模型优化。

Method: 提出了MSDformer方法，通过多尺度时间序列分词器学习多尺度的离散令牌表示，并应用多尺度自回归令牌建模技术。

Result: 实验表明，MSDformer显著优于现有技术，理论分析和实验结果验证了多尺度信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 结合多尺度信息和建模可以显著提升基于DTM的时间序列生成质量。

Abstract: Discrete Token Modeling (DTM), which employs vector quantization techniques,
has demonstrated remarkable success in modeling non-natural language
modalities, particularly in time series generation. While our prior work
SDformer established the first DTM-based framework to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in this domain, two critical limitations persist in existing DTM
approaches: 1) their inability to capture multi-scale temporal patterns
inherent to complex time series data, and 2) the absence of theoretical
foundations to guide model optimization. To address these challenges, we
proposes a novel multi-scale DTM-based time series generation method, called
Multi-Scale Discrete Transformer (MSDformer). MSDformer employs a multi-scale
time series tokenizer to learn discrete token representations at multiple
scales, which jointly characterize the complex nature of time series data.
Subsequently, MSDformer applies a multi-scale autoregressive token modeling
technique to capture the multi-scale patterns of time series within the
discrete latent space. Theoretically, we validate the effectiveness of the DTM
method and the rationality of MSDformer through the rate-distortion theorem.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MSDformer significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating multi-scale information and modeling multi-scale
patterns can substantially enhance the quality of generated time series in
DTM-based approaches. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile sensors has the potential to provide
massive and heterogeneous time series data, driving Artificial Intelligence
applications in mHealth. However, data collection remains limited due to
stringent ethical regulations, privacy concerns, and other constraints,
hindering progress in the field. Synthetic data generation, particularly
through Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, has emerged as a
promising solution to address both data scarcity and privacy issues. Yet, these
models are often limited to short-term, unimodal signal patterns. This paper
presents a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art generative models for time
series synthesis, with a focus on their ability to jointly handle
multi-modality, long-range dependencies, and conditional generation-key
challenges in the mHealth domain. To ensure a fair comparison, we introduce a
novel evaluation framework designed to measure both the intrinsic quality of
synthetic data and its utility in downstream predictive tasks. Our findings
reveal critical limitations in the existing approaches, particularly in
maintaining cross-modal consistency, preserving temporal coherence, and
ensuring robust performance in train-on-synthetic, test-on-real, and data
augmentation scenarios. Finally, we present our future research directions to
enhance synthetic time series generation and improve the applicability of
generative models in mHealth.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于PID控制的张量轮分解（PTWD）模型，用于动态网络的链接预测，通过结合TWD的表示能力和PID控制原理，显著提高了预测准确性。

Motivation: 动态网络中的链接预测需要捕捉时空模式和权重动态，传统静态方法难以胜任，而张量方法提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 采用张量轮分解（TWD）捕获网络拓扑和权重动态，并引入PID控制优化模型参数学习过程。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，PTWD模型在链接预测上比其他模型更准确。

Conclusion: PTWD模型通过结合TWD和PID控制，有效提升了动态网络链接预测的性能。

Abstract: Link prediction in dynamic networks remains a fundamental challenge in
network science, requiring the inference of potential interactions and their
evolving strengths through spatiotemporal pattern analysis. Traditional static
network methods have inherent limitations in capturing temporal dependencies
and weight dynamics, while tensor-based methods offer a promising paradigm by
encoding dynamic networks into high-order tensors to explicitly model
multidimensional interactions across nodes and time. Among them, tensor wheel
decomposition (TWD) stands out for its innovative topological structure, which
decomposes high-order tensors into cyclic factors and core tensors to maintain
structural integrity. To improve the prediction accuracy, this study introduces
a PID-controlled tensor wheel decomposition (PTWD) model, which mainly adopts
the following two ideas: 1) exploiting the representation power of TWD to
capture the latent features of dynamic network topology and weight evolution,
and 2) integrating the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control principle
into the optimization process to obtain a stable model parameter learning
scheme. The performance on four real datasets verifies that the proposed PTWD
model has more accurate link prediction capabilities compared to other models.

Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher
moments. We establish excess risk bounds consisting of subgaussian and
polynomial terms based on the well known integral operator framework. The
dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have
previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent
assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal
under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic
robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise. Our
derivations are based on a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for Hilbert-space valued
random variables.

Abstract: This study explores the use of Federated Learning (FL) for tuberculosis (TB)
diagnosis using chest X-rays in low-resource settings across Africa. FL allows
hospitals to collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw patient data,
addressing privacy concerns and data scarcity that hinder traditional
centralized models. The research involved hospitals and research centers in
eight African countries. Most sites used local datasets, while Ghana and The
Gambia used public ones. The study compared locally trained models with a
federated model built across all institutions to evaluate FL's real-world
feasibility. Despite its promise, implementing FL in sub-Saharan Africa faces
challenges such as poor infrastructure, unreliable internet, limited digital
literacy, and weak AI regulations. Some institutions were also reluctant to
share model updates due to data control concerns. In conclusion, FL shows
strong potential for enabling AI-driven healthcare in underserved regions, but
broader adoption will require improvements in infrastructure, education, and
regulatory support.

Conclusion: FEA通过高效的非奇异近似，显著优化了熵计算工具的性能，为机器学习和量子计算提供了更快速、更经济的方法。

Abstract: Shannon entropy (SE) and its quantum mechanical analogue von Neumann entropy
are key components in many tools used in physics, information theory, machine
learning (ML) and quantum computing. Besides of the significant amounts of SE
computations required in these fields, the singularity of the SE gradient is
one of the central mathematical reason inducing the high cost, frequently low
robustness and slow convergence of such tools. Here we propose the Fast Entropy
Approximation (FEA) - a non-singular rational approximation of Shannon entropy
and its gradient that achieves a mean absolute error of $10^{-3}$, which is
approximately $20$ times lower than comparable state-of-the-art methods. FEA
allows around $50\%$ faster computation, requiring only $5$ to $6$ elementary
computational operations, as compared to tens of elementary operations behind
the fastest entropy computation algorithms with table look-ups, bitshifts, or
series approximations. On a set of common benchmarks for the feature selection
problem in machine learning, we show that the combined effect of fewer
elementary operations, low approximation error, and a non-singular gradient
allows significantly better model quality and enables ML feature extraction
that is two to three orders of magnitude faster and computationally cheaper
when incorporating FEA into AI tools.

Abstract: Integrating combinatorial optimization layers into neural networks has
recently attracted significant research interest. However, many existing
approaches lack theoretical guarantees or fail to perform adequately when
relying on inexact solvers. This is a critical limitation, as many operations
research problems are NP-hard, often necessitating the use of
neighborhood-based local search heuristics. These heuristics iteratively
generate and evaluate candidate solutions based on an acceptance rule. In this
paper, we introduce a theoretically-principled approach for learning with such
inexact combinatorial solvers. Inspired by the connection between simulated
annealing and Metropolis-Hastings, we propose to transform problem-specific
neighborhood systems used in local search heuristics into proposal
distributions, implementing MCMC on the combinatorial space of feasible
solutions. This allows us to construct differentiable combinatorial layers and
associated loss functions. Replacing an exact solver by a local search strongly
reduces the computational burden of learning on many applications. We
demonstrate our approach on a large-scale dynamic vehicle routing problem with
time windows.

Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private second moment estimation and
present a new algorithm that achieve strong privacy-utility trade-offs even for
worst-case inputs under subsamplability assumptions on the data. We call an
input $(m,\alpha,\beta)$-subsamplable if a random subsample of size $m$ (or
larger) preserves w.p $\geq 1-\beta$ the spectral structure of the original
second moment matrix up to a multiplicative factor of $1\pm \alpha$. Building
upon subsamplability, we give a recursive algorithmic framework similar to
Kamath et al 2019, that abides zero-Concentrated Differential Privacy (zCDP)
while preserving w.h.p. the accuracy of the second moment estimation upto an
arbitrary factor of $(1\pm\gamma)$. We then show how to apply our algorithm to

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合序列编码和物理信息神经网络的方法，用于实时应用中动态参数、边界条件和初始条件的自适应建模。

Motivation: 传统方法在参数、边界条件或初始条件变化时需要重新训练模型，效率低。本文旨在解决这一问题，提升模型的适应能力。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the integration of Sequence Encoding for Online
Parameter Identification with Physics-Informed Neural Networks to create a
model that, once trained, can be utilized for real time applications with
variable parameters, boundary conditions, and initial conditions. Recently, the
combination of PINNs with Sparse Regression has emerged as a method for
performing dynamical system identification through supervised learning and
sparse regression optimization, while also solving the dynamics using PINNs.
However, this approach can be limited by variations in parameters or boundary
and initial conditions, requiring retraining of the model whenever changes
occur. In this work, we introduce an architecture that employs Deep Sets or
Sequence Encoders to encode dynamic parameters, boundary conditions, and
initial conditions, using these encoded features as inputs for the PINN,
enabling the model to adapt to changes in parameters, BCs, and ICs. We apply
this approach to three different problems. First, we analyze the Rossler ODE
system, demonstrating the robustness of the model with respect to noise and its
ability to generalize. Next, we explore the model's capability in a 2D
Navier-Stokes PDE problem involving flow past a cylinder with a parametric
sinusoidal inlet velocity function, showing that the model can encode pressure
data from a few points to identify the inlet velocity profile and utilize
physics to compute velocity and pressure throughout the domain. Finally, we
address a 1D heat monitoring problem using real data from the heating of glass
fiber and thermoplastic composite plates.

TL;DR: 论文提出了优势增强策略优化（AAPO），一种新的强化学习算法，通过动量增强优势估计解决现有组相对优势估计方法的训练低效问题，在数学推理基准测试中表现优异。

Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的后训练方法（如GRPO）在消除价值模型依赖方面表现良好，但在估计优势接近零时仍存在训练低效问题，论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出AAPO算法，通过动量增强优势估计优化交叉熵损失，改进组相对优势估计的效率。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AAPO表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: AAPO通过增强优势估计有效提升了训练效率，为强化学习在语言模型推理能力增强中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to
limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods,
group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the
dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to
traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we
observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers
from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage
approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented
Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the
cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based
estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies
associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on
multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance
of AAPO.

TL;DR: X-KAN提出了一种基于进化规则的新方法，通过局部Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KAN）和XCSF框架的结合，显著提高了函数逼近的准确性，特别是在处理局部复杂或不连续函数时表现优异。

Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在处理局部复杂或不连续函数时表现不佳，因为它们依赖单一的全局模型。X-KAN旨在通过多局部模型优化解决这一问题。

Method: X-KAN将KAN的高表达性与XCSF的自适应分区能力相结合，通过规则前提定义局部区域，并在规则结果中使用局部KAN模型。

Result: X-KAN在人工测试函数和真实数据集上均显著优于传统方法（如XCSF、MLP和KAN），且平均仅需7.2±2.3条规则。

Conclusion: X-KAN验证了在XCSF中将KAN作为局部模型的有效性，并通过准确性和通用性评估规则适应性。

Abstract: Function approximation is a critical task in various fields. However,
existing neural network approaches struggle with locally complex or
discontinuous functions due to their reliance on a single global model covering
the entire problem space. We propose X-KAN, a novel method that optimizes
multiple local Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) through an evolutionary
rule-based machine learning framework called XCSF. X-KAN combines KAN's high
expressiveness with XCSF's adaptive partitioning capability by implementing
local KAN models as rule consequents and defining local regions via rule
antecedents. Our experimental results on artificial test functions and
real-world datasets demonstrate that X-KAN significantly outperforms
conventional methods, including XCSF, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and KAN, in terms
of approximation accuracy. Notably, X-KAN effectively handles functions with
locally complex or discontinuous structures that are challenging for
conventional KAN, using a compact set of rules (average 7.2 $\pm$ 2.3 rules).
These results validate the effectiveness of using KAN as a local model in XCSF,
which evaluates the rule fitness based on both accuracy and generality. Our
X-KAN implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/X-KAN.

TL;DR: 研究提出了统一的量化感知训练（QAT）缩放定律，分析了4比特精度（W4A4）下的量化误差来源，并通过混合精度量化优化了性能。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）对计算和内存资源要求高，量化感知训练（QAT）能降低精度但保持性能，但其缩放行为尚未充分理解，尤其是4比特精度下的量化误差来源。

Method: 提出了统一的QAT缩放定律，通过268次实验量化误差与模型大小、训练数据量和量化组大小的关系，并分解了误差来源。

Result: 量化误差随模型增大而减小，随训练数据增加和粒度变粗而增加；FC2层的激活量化误差是主要瓶颈；混合精度量化可以平衡权重量化与激活量化误差。

Conclusion: 研究为QAT的优化提供了关键见解，特别是在4比特精度下，混合精度量化和关注权重量化误差的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory
resources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT)
addresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining
performance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit
precision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often
ignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization
granularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified
scaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,
training data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,
we show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises
with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the
sources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation
components. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization
error, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization
error increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows
that the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is
the primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying
mixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that
weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.
Additionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually
exceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight
quantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer
key insights for improving QAT research and development.

TL;DR: MultiTab提出了一个多维度的表格数据学习算法评估框架，强调模型行为在不同数据特性下的变化，而非仅依赖平均性能。

Motivation: 现有的表格数据评测大多基于平均性能指标，无法揭示模型在不同数据特性下的行为差异。

Method: MultiTab通过分类196个公开数据集的关键特性（如样本量、标签不平衡等），并评估13种代表性模型在不同特性下的表现。

Result: 模型性能对数据特性高度敏感，例如样本级相似性模型在大样本或高特征相关性数据中表现优异，而依赖特征间关系的模型在弱相关数据中表现最佳。

Conclusion: MultiTab揭示了归纳偏置并非总是如预期有效，并强调了基于数据特性的评估对模型选择和设计的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of tabular data in real-world applications, most
benchmarks rely on average-case metrics, which fail to reveal how model
behavior varies across diverse data regimes. To address this, we propose
MultiTab, a benchmark suite and evaluation framework for multi-dimensional,
data-aware analysis of tabular learning algorithms. Rather than comparing
models only in aggregate, MultiTab categorizes 196 publicly available datasets
along key data characteristics, including sample size, label imbalance, and
feature interaction, and evaluates 13 representative models spanning a range of
inductive biases. Our analysis shows that model performance is highly sensitive
to such regimes: for example, models using sample-level similarity excel on
datasets with large sample sizes or high inter-feature correlation, while
models encoding inter-feature dependencies perform best with weakly correlated
features. These findings reveal that inductive biases do not always behave as
intended, and that regime-aware evaluation is essential for understanding and
improving model behavior. MultiTab enables more principled model design and
offers practical guidance for selecting models tailored to specific data
characteristics. All datasets, code, and optimization logs are publicly
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LGAI-DILab/Multitab.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了ReLU神经网络的表达能力，特别是其深度。现有的研究认为$⌈ ⅃₃(n+1) ⌉$层足以计算所有连续分段线性函数（CPWL），但作者证明只需$⌈⅃₃(n-1)⌉+1$层即可，打破了之前的猜想。方法的关键是在两层网络中实现五输入最大值函数。

Motivation: 探索ReLU神经网络的表达能力，尤其是深度对其计算CPWL函数的影响，并验证Hertrich等人的猜想是否正确。

Method: 通过构造性证明，展示了两层ReLU网络可以精确表示五输入最大值函数，并推广到一般情况。

Result: $⌈⅃₃(n-1)⌉+1$层足以计算所有$ℝ^n$上的CPWL函数，改进前人结果。

Conclusion: ReLU神经网络的深度需求比之前认为的更小，为理论研究和实际应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on
their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1)
\rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear
(CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella
(NeurIPS'21) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there
are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require
this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that
$\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL
functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers
can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we
show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute
the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the
$\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in
the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The
constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of
the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in semi-supervised deep learning have introduced
effective strategies for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve
classification performance. This work proposes a semi-supervised framework that
utilizes a distance-based weighting mechanism to prioritize critical training
samples based on their proximity to test data. By focusing on the most
informative examples, the method enhances model generalization and robustness,
particularly in challenging scenarios with noisy or imbalanced datasets.
Building on techniques such as uncertainty consistency and graph-based
representations, the approach addresses key challenges of limited labeled data
while maintaining scalability. Experiments on twelve benchmark datasets
demonstrate significant improvements across key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, and recall, consistently outperforming existing methods. This
framework provides a robust and practical solution for semi-supervised
learning, with potential applications in domains such as healthcare and
security where data limitations pose significant challenges.

Abstract: As language models become more powerful and sophisticated, it is crucial that
they remain trustworthy and reliable. There is concerning preliminary evidence
that models may attempt to deceive or keep secrets from their operators. To
explore the ability of current techniques to elicit such hidden knowledge, we
train a Taboo model: a language model that describes a specific secret word
without explicitly stating it. Importantly, the secret word is not presented to
the model in its training data or prompt. We then investigate methods to
uncover this secret. First, we evaluate non-interpretability (black-box)
approaches. Subsequently, we develop largely automated strategies based on
mechanistic interpretability techniques, including logit lens and sparse
autoencoders. Evaluation shows that both approaches are effective in eliciting
the secret word in our proof-of-concept setting. Our findings highlight the
promise of these approaches for eliciting hidden knowledge and suggest several
promising avenues for future work, including testing and refining these methods
on more complex model organisms. This work aims to be a step towards addressing
the crucial problem of eliciting secret knowledge from language models, thereby
contributing to their safe and reliable deployment.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit heterogeneity across numerous layers of
various types such as residuals, multi-head attention, etc., due to varying
structures (dimensions, activation functions, etc.), distinct representation
characteristics, which impact predictions. We develop a general layer-wise
quantization framework with tight variance and code-length bounds, adapting to
the heterogeneities over the course of training. We then apply a new layer-wise
quantization technique within distributed variational inequalities (VIs),
proposing a novel Quantized Optimistic Dual Averaging (QODA) algorithm with
adaptive learning rates, which achieves competitive convergence rates for
monotone VIs. We empirically show that QODA achieves up to a $150\%$ speedup
over the baselines in end-to-end training time for training Wasserstein GAN on
$12+$ GPUs.

Result: 强制性别平衡的候选名单对多样性提升有限，新算法显著改善性别多样性。

Conclusion: 算法设计选择对实现多样性目标至关重要，需避免筛选与管理者偏好高度相关。

Abstract: Algorithmic tools are increasingly used in hiring to improve fairness and
diversity, often by enforcing constraints such as gender-balanced candidate
shortlists. However, we show theoretically and empirically that enforcing equal
representation at the shortlist stage does not necessarily translate into more
diverse final hires, even when there is no gender bias in the hiring stage. We
identify a crucial factor influencing this outcome: the correlation between the
algorithm's screening criteria and the human hiring manager's evaluation
criteria -- higher correlation leads to lower diversity in final hires. Using a
large-scale empirical analysis of nearly 800,000 job applications across
multiple technology firms, we find that enforcing equal shortlists yields
limited improvements in hire diversity when the algorithmic screening closely
mirrors the hiring manager's preferences. We propose a complementary
algorithmic approach designed explicitly to diversify shortlists by selecting
candidates likely to be overlooked by managers, yet still competitive according
to their evaluation criteria. Empirical simulations show that this approach
significantly enhances gender diversity in final hires without substantially
compromising hire quality. These findings highlight the importance of
algorithmic design choices in achieving organizational diversity goals and
provide actionable guidance for practitioners implementing fairness-oriented
hiring algorithms.

Abstract: Autonomous systems that rely on Machine Learning (ML) utilize online fault
tolerance mechanisms, such as runtime monitors, to detect ML prediction errors
and maintain safety during operation. However, the lack of human-interpretable
explanations for these errors can hinder the creation of strong assurances
about the system's safety and reliability. This paper introduces a novel
fuzzy-based monitor tailored for ML perception components. It provides
human-interpretable explanations about how different operating conditions
affect the reliability of perception components and also functions as a runtime
safety monitor. We evaluated our proposed monitor using naturalistic driving
datasets as part of an automated driving case study. The interpretability of
the monitor was evaluated and we identified a set of operating conditions in
which the perception component performs reliably. Additionally, we created an
assurance case that links unit-level evidence of \textit{correct} ML operation
to system-level \textit{safety}. The benchmarking demonstrated that our monitor
achieved a better increase in safety (i.e., absence of hazardous situations)
while maintaining availability (i.e., ability to perform the mission) compared
to state-of-the-art runtime ML monitors in the evaluated dataset.

Abstract: Existing time series tokenization methods predominantly encode a constant
number of samples into individual tokens. This inflexible approach can generate
excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values,
resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of
byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme
for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs,
our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing
time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous
properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a
lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no
gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series
foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting
performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional
decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we
demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns,
its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations
capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and
trends.

Abstract: Table foundation models bring high hopes to data science: pre-trained on
tabular data to embark knowledge or priors, they should facilitate downstream
tasks on tables. One specific challenge is that of data semantics: numerical
entries take their meaning from context, e.g., column name. Pre-trained neural
networks that jointly model column names and table entries have recently
boosted prediction accuracy. While these models outline the promises of world
knowledge to interpret table values, they lack the convenience of popular
foundation models in text or vision. Indeed, they must be fine-tuned to bring
benefits, come with sizeable computation costs, and cannot easily be reused or
combined with other architectures. Here we introduce TARTE, a foundation model
that transforms tables to knowledge-enhanced vector representations using the
string to capture semantics. Pre-trained on large relational data, TARTE yields
representations that facilitate subsequent learning with little additional
cost. These representations can be fine-tuned or combined with other learners,
giving models that push the state-of-the-art prediction performance and improve
the prediction/computation performance trade-off. Specialized to a task or a
domain, TARTE gives domain-specific representations that facilitate further
learning. Our study demonstrates an effective approach to knowledge
pre-training for tabular learning.

Abstract: We propose a new interpretability method for neural networks, which is based
on a novel mathematico-philosophical theory of reasons. Our method computes a
vector for each neuron, called its reasons vector. We then can compute how
strongly this reasons vector speaks for various propositions, e.g., the
proposition that the input image depicts digit 2 or that the input prompt has a
negative sentiment. This yields an interpretation of neurons, and groups
thereof, that combines a logical and a Bayesian perspective, and accounts for
polysemanticity (i.e., that a single neuron can figure in multiple concepts).
We show, both theoretically and empirically, that this method is: (1) grounded
in a philosophically established notion of explanation, (2) uniform, i.e.,
applies to the common neural network architectures and modalities, (3)
scalable, since computing reason vectors only involves forward-passes in the
neural network, (4) faithful, i.e., intervening on a neuron based on its reason
vector leads to expected changes in model output, (5) correct in that the
model's reasons structure matches that of the data source, (6) trainable, i.e.,
neural networks can be trained to improve their reason strengths, (7) useful,
i.e., it delivers on the needs for interpretability by increasing, e.g.,
robustness and fairness.

Abstract: The objective of this proposal is to bridge the gap between Deep Learning
(DL) and System Dynamics (SD) by developing an interpretable neural system
dynamics framework. While DL excels at learning complex models and making
accurate predictions, it lacks interpretability and causal reliability.
Traditional SD approaches, on the other hand, provide transparency and causal
insights but are limited in scalability and require extensive domain knowledge.
To overcome these limitations, this project introduces a Neural System Dynamics
pipeline, integrating Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic
Interpretability, and Causal Machine Learning. This framework combines the
predictive power of DL with the interpretability of traditional SD models,
resulting in both causal reliability and scalability. The efficacy of the
proposed pipeline will be validated through real-world applications of the
EU-funded AutoMoTIF project, which is focused on autonomous multimodal
transportation systems. The long-term goal is to collect actionable insights
that support the integration of explainability and safety in autonomous
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RefiDiff的创新框架，用于处理高维混合类型数据集中的缺失值问题，尤其在MNAR机制下表现优异。结合局部机器学习预测和Mamba去噪网络，显著提升性能。

Motivation: 高维混合类型数据集在MNAR机制下的缺失值问题是现有方法的短板，急需一种能整合局部和全局特征的方法。

Method: RefiDiff框架结合局部预测和Mamba去噪网络，通过预精细化和后精细化提升稳定性与准确性，统一编码混合类型数据。

Result: RefiDiff在多种缺失值设置下超越现有方法，尤其在MNAR中表现突出，训练速度比DDPM快4倍。

Conclusion: 在九种真实数据集上验证了RefiDiff的鲁棒性、可扩展性和对复杂缺失模式的处理能力。

Abstract: Missing values in high-dimensional, mixed-type datasets pose significant
challenges for data imputation, particularly under Missing Not At Random (MNAR)
mechanisms. Existing methods struggle to integrate local and global data
characteristics, limiting performance in MNAR and high-dimensional settings. We
propose an innovative framework, RefiDiff, combining local machine learning
predictions with a novel Mamba-based denoising network capturing
interrelationships among distant features and samples. Our approach leverages
pre-refinement for initial warm-up imputations and post-refinement to polish
results, enhancing stability and accuracy. By encoding mixed-type data into
unified tokens, RefiDiff enables robust imputation without architectural or
hyperparameter tuning. RefiDiff outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
across missing-value settings, excelling in MNAR with a 4x faster training time
than SOTA DDPM-based approaches. Extensive evaluations on nine real-world
datasets demonstrate its robustness, scalability, and effectiveness in handling
complex missingness patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)的可解释强化学习方法，用于网络控制中的负载均衡，通过提取控制器方程提供决策过程的透明性。

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在网络控制问题中缺乏可解释性，且难以提取控制器方程，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 使用PPO代理结合1层KAN actor模型和MLP Critic网络，学习负载均衡策略以最大化吞吐量效用并最小化损失和延迟。

Result: 通过不同奖励函数的评估，证明该方法能有效提升网络性能，同时提供可解释的策略。

Conclusion: KAN模型为强化学习在网络控制中的应用提供了可解释性和透明性，是解决现有问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to network control
problems, such as load balancing. However, existing RL approaches often suffer
from lack of interpretability and difficulty in extracting controller
equations. In this paper, we propose the use of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KAN) for interpretable RL in network control. We employ a PPO agent with a
1-layer actor KAN model and an MLP Critic network to learn load balancing
policies that maximise throughput utility, minimize loss as well as delay. Our
approach allows us to extract controller equations from the learned neural
networks, providing insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate our
approach using different reward functions demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving network performance while providing interpretable policies.

Motivation: 探究图对抗攻击中是否存在内在韧性状态，并找到这种关键状态。

Method: 将图对抗学习建模为多目标动态系统，提出理论框架证明韧性状态存在，并开发一维函数捕捉动态变化。

Result: 在五个常用数据集和三种代表性攻击下，提出的方法显著优于现有防御技术。

Conclusion: 图对抗攻击存在内在韧性状态，通过动态系统方法可以有效捕捉并防御攻击。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks to graph analytics are gaining increased attention. To
date, two lines of countermeasures have been proposed to resist various graph
adversarial attacks from the perspectives of either graph per se or graph
neural networks. Nevertheless, a fundamental question lies in whether there
exists an intrinsic adversarial resilience state within a graph regime and how
to find out such a critical state if exists. This paper contributes to tackle
the above research questions from three unique perspectives: i) we regard the
process of adversarial learning on graph as a complex multi-object dynamic
system, and model the behavior of adversarial attack; ii) we propose a
generalized theoretical framework to show the existence of critical adversarial
resilience state; and iii) we develop a condensed one-dimensional function to
capture the dynamic variation of graph regime under perturbations, and pinpoint
the critical state through solving the equilibrium point of dynamic system.
Multi-facet experiments are conducted to show our proposed approach can
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art defense methods under five
commonly-used real-world datasets and three representative attacks.

TL;DR: 当前的无服务器计算在通用LLM推理中表现良好，但在LoRA推理中存在参数冗余、加载延迟高和资源竞争等问题。ServerlessLoRA通过共享骨干LLM、预加载LoRA工件和资源优化，显著提升了性能和降低了成本。

Motivation: 解决当前无服务器计算在LoRA推理中的参数冗余、加载延迟和资源竞争问题，以提升性能和降低成本。

Method: 提出ServerlessLoRA系统，包括骨干LLM共享、LoRA工件预加载和资源管理优化技术。

Result: 实验证明，ServerlessLoRA将TTFT降低86%，成本降低89%。

Conclusion: ServerlessLoRA为LoRA LLM推理提供了更高效、更低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM)
inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid
scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively
serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to
three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where
99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency
beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple
LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased
Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs.
  We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for
faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM
sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a
pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize
cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware
batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty
workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA
reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to
state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了基于强化学习的个性化胰岛素治疗推荐方法ABBA，用于1型和2型糖尿病患者的血糖管理，通过模拟测试显示其相比标准方法显著提高了血糖达标时间和减少了血糖异常时间。

Motivation: 尽管胰岛素制剂和技术有所进步，调整胰岛素剂量对大多数1型和长期2型糖尿病患者仍具挑战性，因此需要开发更个性化的胰岛素治疗推荐方法。

Method: 研究开发了ABBA（Adaptive Basal-Bolus Advisor），通过强化学习为患者提供个性化胰岛素剂量建议，并在FDA认可的模拟人群中进行了测试。

Result: 模拟测试显示，ABBA显著提高了血糖达标时间，减少了低血糖和高血糖时间，且性能持续提升，效果优于标准方法。

Conclusion: ABBA有望进一步优化血糖控制，支持患者的日常自我管理，值得在人体试验中进一步验证。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in insulin preparations and technology, adjusting
insulin remains an ongoing challenge for the majority of people with type 1
diabetes (T1D) and longstanding type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we
propose the Adaptive Basal-Bolus Advisor (ABBA), a personalised insulin
treatment recommendation approach based on reinforcement learning for
individuals with T1D and T2D, performing self-monitoring blood glucose
measurements and multiple daily insulin injection therapy. We developed and
evaluated the ability of ABBA to achieve better time-in-range (TIR) for
individuals with T1D and T2D, compared to a standard basal-bolus advisor (BBA).
The in-silico test was performed using an FDA-accepted population, including
101 simulated adults with T1D and 101 with T2D. An in-silico evaluation shows
that ABBA significantly improved TIR and significantly reduced both times
below- and above-range, compared to BBA. ABBA's performance continued to
improve over two months, whereas BBA exhibited only modest changes. This
personalised method for adjusting insulin has the potential to further optimise
glycaemic control and support people with T1D and T2D in their daily
self-management. Our results warrant ABBA to be trialed for the first time in
humans.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过“割线损失”学习ODE积分的方法，以平衡性能和成本，加速扩散模型推理。

Motivation: 在极小步长下，数值求解器性能不佳，而蒸馏技术则复杂且不稳定，需要一种中间策略来平衡。

Method: 通过蒙特卡洛积分和皮卡迭代，从导数-积分关系中推导出损失函数（割线损失），逐步将切线扩展到割线。

Result: 实验表明，EDM和SiT-XL/2模型的割线版本在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-256×256上均取得优异结果。

Conclusion: 割线损失能快速调整预训练扩散模型，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: To accelerate diffusion model inference, numerical solvers perform poorly at
extremely small steps, while distillation techniques often introduce complexity
and instability. This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing
performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived
from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration
and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by
gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses.
The secant losses can rapidly convert (via fine-tuning or distillation) a
pretrained diffusion model into its secant version. In our experiments, the
secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the
secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID
of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$. Code will be available.

Abstract: In spite of their prevalence, the behaviour of Neural Networks when
extrapolating far from the training distribution remains poorly understood,
with existing results limited to specific cases. In this work, we prove general
results -- the first of their kind -- by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and
prove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the
induced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the
output of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even
on inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class
of networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain
inputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on
finite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit
uncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively
mitigates this instability. Finally, we explore real-world implications of this
extrapolatory stability, including applications to predicting residue sizes in
proteins larger than those seen during training and estimating age from facial
images of underrepresented ethnicities absent from the training set.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为潜在流变换器（LFT）的方法，通过将多个离散层替换为单个学习的传输算子，显著压缩模型尺寸，同时保持性能，并且提出了Flow Walking算法以优化流匹配方法。

Motivation: 传统大语言模型的层数虽多但效率不高，而连续层在图像生成中表现出色。论文旨在探索如何将连续层的优势引入语言模型。

Method: 提出的LFT方法采用流匹配训练的传输算子替代多个离散层，并引入Flow Walking算法以保持耦合性。

Result: 在Pythia-410M模型上，LFT成功压缩了6层（共24层），性能优于直接跳过2层的方法。进一步使用Flow Walking算法时，能将12层压缩至1层。

Conclusion: LFT的设计展示了在语言模型中结合连续层优势的可行性，显著缩短了自回归和流式生成方法之间的差距。

Abstract: Transformers, the standard implementation for large language models (LLMs),
typically consist of tens to hundreds of discrete layers. While more layers can
lead to better performance, this approach has been challenged as far from
efficient, especially given the superiority of continuous layers demonstrated
by diffusion and flow-based models for image generation. We propose the Latent
Flow Transformer (LFT), which replaces a block of layers with a single learned
transport operator trained via flow matching, offering significant compression
while maintaining compatibility with the original architecture. Additionally,
we address the limitations of existing flow-based methods in \textit{preserving
coupling} by introducing the Flow Walking (FW) algorithm. On the Pythia-410M
model, LFT trained with flow matching compresses 6 of 24 layers and outperforms
directly skipping 2 layers (KL Divergence of LM logits at 0.407 vs. 0.529),
demonstrating the feasibility of this design. When trained with FW, LFT further
distills 12 layers into one while reducing the KL to 0.736 surpassing that from
skipping 3 layers (0.932), significantly narrowing the gap between
autoregressive and flow-based generation paradigms.

Abstract: Wind hazards such as tornadoes and straight-line winds frequently affect
vulnerable communities in the Great Plains of the United States, where limited
infrastructure and sparse data coverage hinder effective emergency response.
Existing forecasting systems focus primarily on meteorological elements and
often fail to capture community-specific vulnerabilities, limiting their
utility for localized risk assessment and resilience planning. To address this
gap, we propose an interpretable dual-stream learning framework that integrates
structured numerical weather data with unstructured textual event narratives.
Our architecture combines a Random Forest and RoBERTa-based transformer through
a late fusion mechanism, enabling robust and context-aware wind hazard
prediction. The system is tailored for underserved tribal communities and
supports block-level risk assessment. Experimental results show significant
performance gains over traditional baselines. Furthermore, gradient-based
sensitivity and ablation studies provide insight into the model's
decision-making process, enhancing transparency and operational trust. The
findings demonstrate both predictive effectiveness and practical value in
supporting emergency preparedness and advancing community resilience.

Motivation: 现有触发器检测/移除方法通常需要预先了解目标模型的详细信息、大量干净样本或模型重新训练权限，限制了实际应用。理想的防御方法应在不了解目标模型的情况下消除植入的触发器。

Method: 通过Hopfield网络的记忆关联功能，提出轻量级黑盒防御方法SifterNet，利用Ising模型的思想净化输入样本中的触发器。

Abstract: Aiming at resisting backdoor attacks in convolution neural networks and
vision Transformer-based large model, this paper proposes a generalized and
model-agnostic trigger-purification approach resorting to the classic Ising
model. To date, existing trigger detection/removal studies usually require to
know the detailed knowledge of target model in advance, access to a large
number of clean samples or even model-retraining authorization, which brings
the huge inconvenience for practical applications, especially inaccessible to
target model. An ideal countermeasure ought to eliminate the implanted trigger
without regarding whatever the target models are. To this end, a lightweight
and black-box defense approach SifterNet is proposed through leveraging the
memorization-association functionality of Hopfield network, by which the
triggers of input samples can be effectively purified in a proper manner. The
main novelty of our proposed approach lies in the introduction of ideology of
Ising model. Extensive experiments also validate the effectiveness of our
approach in terms of proper trigger purification and high accuracy achievement,
and compared to the state-of-the-art baselines under several commonly-used
datasets, our SiferNet has a significant superior performance.

Abstract: Agent-based Transformers have been widely adopted in recent reinforcement
learning advances due to their demonstrated ability to solve complex tasks.
However, the high computational complexity of Transformers often results in
significant energy consumption, limiting their deployment in real-world
autonomous systems. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their biologically
inspired structure, offer an energy-efficient alternative for machine learning.
In this paper, a novel Spike-Transformer Reinforcement Learning (STRL)
algorithm that combines the energy efficiency of SNNs with the powerful
decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning is developed.
Specifically, an SNN using multi-step Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons
and attention mechanisms capable of processing spatio-temporal patterns over
multiple time steps is designed. The architecture is further enhanced with
state, action, and reward encodings to create a Transformer-like structure
optimized for reinforcement learning tasks. Comprehensive numerical experiments
conducted on state-of-the-art benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed SNN
Transformer achieves significantly improved policy performance compared to
conventional agent-based Transformers. With both enhanced energy efficiency and
policy optimality, this work highlights a promising direction for deploying
bio-inspired, low-cost machine learning models in complex real-world
decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant potential for
energy-efficient sensory processing but face critical challenges in modality
imbalance and temporal misalignment. Current approaches suffer from
uncoordinated convergence speeds across modalities and static fusion mechanisms
that ignore time-varying cross-modal interactions. We propose the temporal
attention-guided adaptive fusion framework for multimodal SNNs with two
synergistic innovations: 1) The Temporal Attention-guided Adaptive Fusion
(TAAF) module that dynamically assigns importance scores to fused spiking
features at each timestep, enabling hierarchical integration of temporally
heterogeneous spike-based features; 2) The temporal adaptive balanced fusion
loss that modulates learning rates per modality based on the above attention
scores, preventing dominant modalities from monopolizing optimization. The
proposed framework implements adaptive fusion, especially in the temporal
dimension, and alleviates the modality imbalance during multimodal learning,
mimicking cortical multisensory integration principles. Evaluations on CREMA-D,
AVE, and EAD datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (77.55\%,
70.65\% and 97.5\%accuracy, respectively) with energy efficiency. The system
resolves temporal misalignment through learnable time-warping operations and
faster modality convergence coordination than baseline SNNs. This work
establishes a new paradigm for temporally coherent multimodal learning in
neuromorphic systems, bridging the gap between biological sensory processing
and efficient machine intelligence.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型通常是任务特定的，且依赖于数据集特定的训练和复杂的特征工程。尽管基于Transformer的架构提高了可扩展性，但时间序列领域的基础模型仍未被充分探索，且主要用于预测任务。

Method: CHARM通过结合通道级文本描述的架构创新，并保持对通道顺序的不变性，解决了时间序列基础学习的独特困难。模型采用联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA），结合新的增强方案和设计用于提高可解释性和训练稳定性的损失函数进行训练。

Abstract: Traditional time series models are task-specific and often depend on
dataset-specific training and extensive feature engineering. While
Transformer-based architectures have improved scalability, foundation models,
commonplace in text, vision, and audio, remain under-explored for time series
and are largely restricted to forecasting. We introduce $\textbf{CHARM}$, a
foundation embedding model for multivariate time series that learns shared,
transferable, and domain-aware representations. To address the unique
difficulties of time series foundation learning, $\textbf{CHARM}$ incorporates
architectural innovations that integrate channel-level textual descriptions
while remaining invariant to channel order. The model is trained using a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), with novel augmentation schemes and a
loss function designed to improve interpretability and training stability. Our
$7$M-parameter model achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse
downstream tasks, setting a new benchmark for time series representation

Abstract: Weather forecasting is essential but remains computationally intensive and

PhyDL-NWP, a physics-guided deep learning framework that integrates physical

predicts weather variables from arbitrary spatiotemporal coordinates, computes
physical terms via automatic differentiation, and uses a physics-informed loss
to align predictions with governing dynamics. PhyDL-NWP enables resolution-free
downscaling by modeling weather as a continuous function and fine-tunes
pre-trained models with minimal overhead, achieving up to 170x faster inference
with only 55K parameters. Experiments show that PhyDL-NWP improves both
forecasting performance and physical consistency.

Abstract: This paper reviews the topological groundwork for the study of reinforcement
learning (RL) by focusing on the structure of state, action, and policy spaces.
We begin by recalling key mathematical concepts such as complete metric spaces,
which form the foundation for expressing RL problems. By leveraging the Banach
contraction principle, we illustrate how the Banach fixed-point theorem
explains the convergence of RL algorithms and how Bellman operators, expressed
as operators on Banach spaces, ensure this convergence. The work serves as a
bridge between theoretical mathematics and practical algorithm design, offering
new approaches to enhance the efficiency of RL. In particular, we investigate
alternative formulations of Bellman operators and demonstrate their impact on
improving convergence rates and performance in standard RL environments such as
MountainCar, CartPole, and Acrobot. Our findings highlight how a deeper
mathematical understanding of RL can lead to more effective algorithms for
decision-making problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant strides in various domains,
and policy gradient methods like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) have gained
popularity due to their balance in performance, training stability, and
computational efficiency. These methods directly optimize policies through
gradient-based updates. However, developing effective control policies for
environments with complex and non-linear dynamics remains a challenge. High
variance in gradient estimates and non-convex optimization landscapes often
lead to unstable learning trajectories. Koopman Operator Theory has emerged as
a powerful framework for studying non-linear systems through an
infinite-dimensional linear operator that acts on a higher-dimensional space of
measurement functions. In contrast with their non-linear counterparts, linear
systems are simpler, more predictable, and easier to analyze. In this paper, we
present Koopman-Inspired Proximal Policy Optimization (KIPPO), which learns an
approximately linear latent-space representation of the underlying system's
dynamics while retaining essential features for effective policy learning. This
is achieved through a Koopman-approximation auxiliary network that can be added
to the baseline policy optimization algorithms without altering the
architecture of the core policy or value function. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate consistent improvements over the PPO baseline with 6-60%
increased performance while reducing variability by up to 91% when evaluated on
various continuous control tasks.

Abstract: Artificial neural network pruning is a method in which artificial neural
network sizes can be reduced while attempting to preserve the predicting
capabilities of the network. This is done to make the model smaller or faster
during inference time. In this work we analyze the ability of a selection of
artificial neural network pruning methods to generalize to a new cybersecurity
dataset utilizing a simpler network type than was designed for. We analyze each
method using a variety of pruning degrees to best understand how each algorithm
responds to the new environment. This has allowed us to determine the most well
fit pruning method of those we searched for the task. Unexpectedly, we have
found that many of them do not generalize to the problem well, leaving only a
few algorithms working to an acceptable degree.

TL;DR: 本文提出了物理信息降阶模型（Φ-ROM），通过将可微PDE求解器集成到训练过程中，显著提高了模型的泛化能力和长期预测性能。

Motivation: 现有的降阶模型（ROM）在训练过程中未包含高保真数值求解器，导致潜在动力学偏离实际物理规律，限制了模型的泛化和预测能力。

Method: 提出Φ-ROM模型，通过直接利用求解器中的物理方程来塑造潜在空间动力学及其对PDE参数的依赖关系，确保与原始系统的强一致性。

Result: Φ-ROM在泛化性、长期预测、时空连续性以及数据成本方面均优于现有方法，即使在稀疏和不规则的观测数据下也能恢复和预测解场。

Conclusion: Φ-ROM通过融合物理信息提升了降阶模型的性能，提供了一个适用于多种PDE系统和可微求解器的灵活框架。

Abstract: Reduced-order modeling (ROM) of time-dependent and parameterized differential
equations aims to accelerate the simulation of complex high-dimensional systems
by learning a compact latent manifold representation that captures the
characteristics of the solution fields and their time-dependent dynamics.
Although high-fidelity numerical solvers generate the training datasets, they
have thus far been excluded from the training process, causing the learned
latent dynamics to drift away from the discretized governing physics. This
mismatch often limits generalization and forecasting capabilities. In this
work, we propose Physics-informed ROM ($\Phi$-ROM) by incorporating
differentiable PDE solvers into the training procedure. Specifically, the
latent space dynamics and its dependence on PDE parameters are shaped directly
by the governing physics encoded in the solver, ensuring a strong
correspondence between the full and reduced systems. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven ROMs and other physics-informed strategies by
accurately generalizing to new dynamics arising from unseen parameters,
enabling long-term forecasting beyond the training horizon, maintaining
continuity in both time and space, and reducing the data cost. Furthermore,
$\Phi$-ROM learns to recover and forecast the solution fields even when trained
or evaluated with sparse and irregular observations of the fields, providing a
flexible framework for field reconstruction and data assimilation. We
demonstrate the framework's robustness across different PDE solvers and
highlight its broad applicability by providing an open-source JAX
implementation readily extensible to other PDE systems and differentiable
solvers.

Motivation: 为了解决时间序列聚类中缺乏真实基准的问题，使研究者能客观评估聚类质量和算法表现。

Method: 提出CSTS基准，包含不同的相关性结构、系统变化的数据条件、性能阈值和评估协议。

Result: 实证结果显示相关性结构在下采样时中度失真，而对分布偏移和稀疏化影响较小。

Conclusion: CSTS为基于相关性的时间序列聚类提供了严格的评估标准，并能精确诊断方法局限性。

Abstract: Time series clustering promises to uncover hidden structural patterns in data
with applications across healthcare, finance, industrial systems, and other
critical domains. However, without validated ground truth information,
researchers cannot objectively assess clustering quality or determine whether
poor results stem from absent structures in the data, algorithmic limitations,
or inappropriate validation methods, raising the question whether clustering is
"more art than science" (Guyon et al., 2009). To address these challenges, we
introduce CSTS (Correlation Structures in Time Series), a synthetic benchmark
for evaluating the discovery of correlation structures in multivariate time
series data. CSTS provides a clean benchmark that enables researchers to
isolate and identify specific causes of clustering failures by differentiating
between correlation structure deterioration and limitations of clustering
algorithms and validation methods. Our contributions are: (1) a comprehensive
benchmark for correlation structure discovery with distinct correlation
structures, systematically varied data conditions, established performance
thresholds, and recommended evaluation protocols; (2) empirical validation of
correlation structure preservation showing moderate distortion from
downsampling and minimal effects from distribution shifts and sparsification;
and (3) an extensible data generation framework enabling structure-first
clustering evaluation. A case study demonstrates CSTS's practical utility by
identifying an algorithm's previously undocumented sensitivity to non-normal
distributions, illustrating how the benchmark enables precise diagnosis of
methodological limitations. CSTS advances rigorous evaluation standards for
correlation-based time series clustering.

Conclusion: Φ-Module通过嵌入基于第一性原理的约束，显著提升了性能，同时保持了超参数友好、内存高效和训练轻量化的特点。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network interatomic potentials have emerged as a
promising research direction. However, popular deep learning models often lack
auxiliary constraints grounded in physical laws, which could accelerate
training and improve fidelity through physics-based regularization. In this
work, we introduce $\Phi$-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces
Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic
interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise
representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation,
making it possible to acquire a potential $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and a
corresponding charge density $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ linked to the learnable
Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an
electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This
approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with
insignificant computational overhead. Experiments on the OE62 and MD22
benchmarks confirm that models combined with $\Phi$-Module achieve robust
improvements over baseline counterparts. For OE62 error reduction ranges from
4.5\% to 17.8\%, and for MD22, baseline equipped with $\Phi$-Module achieves
best results on 5 out of 14 cases. Our results underscore how embedding a
first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly
improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient
and lightweight in training. Code will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出使用最大均值差异（MMD）解决连续多目标优化问题（MOPs），通过分析梯度和Hessian矩阵，设计了一种新的MMD-based Newton方法（MMDN），并与多目标进化算法（MOEA）结合，实验证实混合算法优化效果更佳。

Motivation: 多目标优化问题中，常用Hausdorff距离衡量近似Pareto前沿与参考集的差异。本文提出使用MMD作为更优的距离度量，以提高优化精度。

Method: 1. 使用MMD度量两个集合的距离；2. 提供MMD的梯度和Hessian矩阵解析表达式，设计MMDN方法；3. 将MMDN与MOEA结合，先运行EA逼近全局Pareto前沿，再启动MMDN进行精细优化。

Result: 在11个基准问题上测试，混合算法（MMDN + MOEA）在相同计算资源下比单独使用EA优化精度更高。

Conclusion: MMD为多目标优化问题提供了有效的距离度量，结合梯度和Hessian的MMDN方法能够显著提升优化效果，尤其是与MOEA的混合使用。

Abstract: Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been widely employed to measure the
distance between probability distributions. In this paper, we propose using MMD
to solve continuous multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). For solving
MOPs, a common approach is to minimize the distance (e.g., Hausdorff) between a
finite approximate set of the Pareto front and a reference set. Viewing these
two sets as empirical measures, we propose using MMD to measure the distance
between them. To minimize the MMD value, we provide the analytical expression
of its gradient and Hessian matrix w.r.t. the search variables, and use them to
devise a novel set-oriented, MMD-based Newton (MMDN) method. Also, we analyze
the theoretical properties of MMD's gradient and Hessian, including the
first-order stationary condition and the eigenspectrum of the Hessian, which
are important for verifying the correctness of MMDN. To solve complicated
problems, we propose hybridizing MMDN with multiobjective evolutionary
algorithms (MOEAs), where we first execute an EA for several iterations to get
close to the global Pareto front and then warm-start MMDN with the result of
the MOEA to efficiently refine the approximation. We empirically test the
hybrid algorithm on 11 widely used benchmark problems, and the results show the
hybrid (MMDN + MOEA) can achieve a much better optimization accuracy than EA
alone with the same computation budget.

Conclusion: 虚拟细胞的研究方向为药物发现社区提供了优化模型开发的实用框架。

Abstract: Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of
treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from
computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling
researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely
and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific
model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of
perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective
treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual
cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that
unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of
cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab
automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities
for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing
and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We
argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual
cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to
perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of
modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key
principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a
lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate
for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development.
Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful
framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including
virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research
community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug
discovery outcomes.

Motivation: 为解决LoRA调整后模型在复杂推理任务中因基模型偏差而表现不佳的问题，提高模型对任务特定知识的利用。

Method: 提出CoLD框架，对比专家模型与基模型的概率分布差异，选择更符合LoRA表征的候选词，并针对华为Ascend NPU优化计算效率。

Result: CoLD将任务准确率提高5.54%，同时端到端延迟降低28%。

Conclusion: CoLD为资源受限环境下的LLM解码提供了高效方法，对云和本地应用均具有重要意义。

Abstract: Huawei Cloud users leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as an efficient and
scalable method to fine-tune and customize large language models (LLMs) for
application-specific needs. However, tasks that require complex reasoning or
deep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from
the base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search.
These biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model
instead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we
introduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed
to maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models,
resulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by
scoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability
distributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model.
This approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned
representations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective,
a naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each
decoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models.
To address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD
achieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end
latency by 28% compared to greedy decoding. This work provides practical and
efficient decoding strategies for fine-tuned LLMs in resource-constrained
environments and has broad implications for applied data science in both cloud
and on-premises settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their
policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of
rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze
a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct
model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals
that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where
the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and
theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by
depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To
mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments
existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false
negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward
estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts
pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.
Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false
negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of
LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food

several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there
has been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We
introduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide
personalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated
micro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts
entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as
context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system
generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To
evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe
related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly
outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for
food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis. Our code and
benchmark datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: We present the first theoretical framework that connects predictive coding
(PC), a biologically inspired local learning rule, with the minimum description
length (MDL) principle in deep networks. We prove that layerwise PC performs
block-coordinate descent on the MDL two-part code objective, thereby jointly
minimizing empirical risk and model complexity. Using Hoeffding's inequality
and a prefix-code prior, we derive a novel generalization bound of the form
$R(\theta) \le \^{R}(\theta) + \frac{L(\theta)}{N}$, capturing the tradeoff
between fit and compression. We further prove that each PC sweep monotonically
decreases the empirical two-part codelength, yielding tighter high-probability
risk bounds than unconstrained gradient descent. Finally, we show that repeated
PC updates converge to a block-coordinate stationary point, providing an
approximate MDL-optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first result
offering formal generalization and convergence guarantees for PC-trained deep
models, positioning PC as a theoretically grounded and biologically plausible
alternative to backpropagation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is linked
to high morbidity and mortality. In a fast-evolving AF rhythm control treatment
era, predicting AF recurrence after its onset may be crucial to achieve the
optimal therapeutic approach, yet traditional scores like CHADS2-VASc, HATCH,
and APPLE show limited predictive accuracy. Moreover, early diagnosis studies
often rely on codified electronic health record (EHR) data, which may contain
errors and missing information.
  OBJECTIVE: This study aims to predict AF recurrence between one month and two
years after onset by evaluating traditional clinical scores, ML models, and our
LTM approach. Moreover, another objective is to develop a methodology for
integrating structured and unstructured data to enhance tabular dataset
quality.
  METHODS: A tabular dataset was generated by combining structured clinical
data with free-text discharge reports processed through natural language
processing techniques, reducing errors and annotation effort. A total of 1,508
patients with documented AF onset were identified, and models were evaluated on
a manually annotated test set. The proposed approach includes a LTM compared
against traditional clinical scores and ML models.
  RESULTS: The proposed LTM approach achieved the highest predictive
performance, surpassing both traditional clinical scores and ML models.
Additionally, the gender and age bias analyses revealed demographic
disparities.
  CONCLUSION: The integration of structured data and free-text sources resulted
in a high-quality dataset. The findings emphasize the limitations of
traditional clinical scores in predicting AF recurrence and highlight the
potential of ML-based approaches, particularly our LTM model.

training LLMs in FP4 precision face significant accuracy degradation and often
rely on mixed-precision fallbacks. In this paper, we systematically investigate
hardware-supported FP4 training and introduce Quartet, a new approach enabling
accurate, end-to-end FP4 training with all the major computations (in e.g.
linear layers) being performed in low precision. Through extensive evaluations
on Llama-type models, we reveal a new low-precision scaling law that quantifies
performance trade-offs across varying bit-widths and allows us to identify a
"near-optimal" low-precision training technique in terms of
accuracy-vs-computation, called Quartet. We implement Quartet using optimized
CUDA kernels tailored for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, and show that it can achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy for FP4 precision, successfully training
billion-scale models. Our method demonstrates that fully FP4-based training is
a competitive alternative to standard-precision and FP8 training. Our code is
available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/Quartet.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合语义和拓扑的LLM框架OGA，以解决开放世界中标签不足和未知类别节点的问题。

Motivation: 现有方法在处理开放世界中的数据不确定性时表现不足，尤其是标签不足和未知类别节点的问题。

Method: 提出OGA框架，结合自适应标签追踪（整合语义和拓扑）和图标签标注器。

Result: 实验表明OGA在有效性和实用性上表现优异。

Conclusion: OGA成功解决了开放世界图学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced
text-attributed graph (TAG) learning. However, existing methods inadequately
handle data uncertainty in open-world scenarios, especially concerning limited
labeling and unknown-class nodes. Prior solutions typically rely on isolated
semantic or structural approaches for unknown-class rejection, lacking
effective annotation pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
Open-world Graph Assistant (OGA), an LLM-based framework that combines adaptive
label traceability, which integrates semantics and topology for unknown-class
rejection, and a graph label annotator to enable model updates using newly
annotated nodes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate OGA's effectiveness and
practicality.

Abstract: The scarcity of data depicting dangerous situations presents a major obstacle
to training AI systems for safety-critical applications, such as construction
safety, where ethical and logistical barriers hinder real-world data
collection. This creates an urgent need for an end-to-end framework to generate
synthetic data that can bridge this gap. While existing methods can produce
synthetic scenes, they often lack the semantic depth required for scene
simulations, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-agent framework that employs an iterative, in-the-loop collaboration
between two agents: an Evaluator Agent, acting as an LLM-based judge to enforce
semantic consistency and safety-specific constraints, and an Editor Agent,
which generates and refines scenes based on this guidance. Powered by LLM's
capabilities to reasoning and common-sense knowledge, this collaborative design
produces synthetic images tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Our
experiments suggest this design can generate useful scenes based on realistic
specifications that address the shortcomings of prior approaches, balancing
safety requirements with visual semantics. This iterative process holds promise
for delivering robust, aesthetically sound simulations, offering a potential
solution to the data scarcity challenge in multimedia safety applications.

Motivation: 当前LLMs在工程任务评估中的方法过于简化，未能充分体现真实工程的复杂性。

Method: 研究者构建了一个包含真实工程问题的数据集，并系统评估了四种LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在基础和结构性推理上表现良好，但在抽象推理、形式化建模和工程逻辑上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在工程任务中的潜力有限，需要进一步改进以应对复杂工程问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformative not only for daily activities
but also for engineering tasks. However, current evaluations of LLMs in
engineering exhibit two critical shortcomings: (i) the reliance on simplified
use cases, often adapted from examination materials where correctness is easily
verifiable, and (ii) the use of ad hoc scenarios that insufficiently capture
critical engineering competencies. Consequently, the assessment of LLMs on
complex, real-world engineering problems remains largely unexplored. This paper
addresses this gap by introducing a curated database comprising over 100
questions derived from authentic, production-oriented engineering scenarios,
systematically designed to cover core competencies such as product design,
prognosis, and diagnosis. Using this dataset, we evaluate four state-of-the-art
LLMs, including both cloud-based and locally hosted instances, to
systematically investigate their performance on complex engineering tasks. Our
results show that LLMs demonstrate strengths in basic temporal and structural
reasoning but struggle significantly with abstract reasoning, formal modeling,
and context-sensitive engineering logic.

Result: TransKT显著提升了知识转移的性能，提供了更准确的学习者知识状态表示。

Conclusion: 跨课程知识转移能够有效提升知识跟踪模型的性能，尤其是通过概念图和大语言模型的支持。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict learners' future performance based on
historical learning interactions. However, existing KT models predominantly
focus on data from a single course, limiting their ability to capture a
comprehensive understanding of learners' knowledge states. In this paper, we
propose TransKT, a contrastive cross-course knowledge tracing method that
leverages concept graph guided knowledge transfer to model the relationships
between learning behaviors across different courses, thereby enhancing
knowledge state estimation. Specifically, TransKT constructs a cross-course
concept graph by leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM) prompts to
establish implicit links between related concepts across different courses.
This graph serves as the foundation for knowledge transfer, enabling the model
to integrate and enhance the semantic features of learners' interactions across
courses. Furthermore, TransKT includes an LLM-to-LM pipeline for incorporating
summarized semantic features, which significantly improves the performance of
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) used for knowledge transfer. Additionally,
TransKT employs a contrastive objective that aligns single-course and
cross-course knowledge states, thereby refining the model's ability to provide
a more robust and accurate representation of learners' overall knowledge
states.

TL;DR: ADALog是一种自适应、无监督的异常检测框架，适用于异构日志数据，无需依赖日志解析或标记数据。

Motivation: 现代软件系统生成的日志数据具有动态格式、碎片化事件序列和变化的时序模式，使得异常检测变得重要且具有挑战性。

Method: ADALog使用基于Transformer的预训练双向编码器，通过掩码语言建模任务对正常日志进行微调，提取日志内上下文关系，并通过自适应百分位阈值识别异常。

Result: 在BGL、Thunderbird和Spirit基准数据集上，ADALog表现出强大的泛化能力和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ADALog能够动态适应系统行为变化，无需依赖固定阈值，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Modern software systems generate extensive heterogeneous log data with
dynamic formats, fragmented event sequences, and varying temporal patterns,
making anomaly detection both crucial and challenging. To address these
complexities, we propose ADALog, an adaptive, unsupervised anomaly detection
framework designed for practical applicability across diverse real-world
environments. Unlike traditional methods reliant on log parsing, strict
sequence dependencies, or labeled data, ADALog operates on individual
unstructured logs, extracts intra-log contextual relationships, and performs
adaptive thresholding on normal data. The proposed approach utilizes a
transformer-based, pretrained bidirectional encoder with a masked language
modeling task, fine-tuned on normal logs to capture domain-specific syntactic
and semantic patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. Anomalies are
identified via token-level reconstruction probabilities, aggregated into
log-level scores, with adaptive percentile-based thresholding calibrated only
on normal data. This allows the model to dynamically adapt to evolving system
behaviors while avoiding rigid, heuristic-based thresholds common in
traditional systems. We evaluate ADALog on benchmark datasets BGL, Thunderbird,
and Spirit, showing strong generalization and competitive performance compared
to state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Additional ablation
studies examine the effects of masking, fine-tuning, and token positioning on
model behavior and interpretability.

Result: Claude 3.5 Haiku表现最佳，赚取约152万美元，其次是GPT-4o-mini（149万美元）、Qwen 2.5（133万美元）和Mistral（70万美元）。

Conclusion: 最强模型能解决大部分任务，但结构化任务与真实自由职业复杂性仍有差距。

Abstract: This study explores Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for
real-world tasks, including freelance software development. This work presents
a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on freelance programming and data analysis
tasks derived from economic data. We construct the benchmark using synthetic
tasks created from a Kaggle Freelancer dataset of job postings, with all job
prices standardized to USD (median fixed-project price around $250, and an
average of $306). Each task is accompanied by structured input-output test
cases and an estimated price tag, enabling automated correctness checking and a
monetary performance valuation. This approach is inspired by OpenAI's recent
SWE-Lancer benchmark (1,400 real Upwork tasks worth $1M total). Still, our
framework simplifies evaluation using programmatically testable tasks and
predicted price values, making it highly scalable and repeatable. On this
benchmark, we evaluate four modern LLMs - Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen
2.5, and Mistral. We report each model's accuracy (task success rate and
test-case pass rate) and the total "freelance earnings" it achieves (sum of
prices of solved tasks). Our results show that Claude 3.5 Haiku performs best,
earning approximately $1.52 million USD, followed closely by GPT-4o-mini at
$1.49 million, then Qwen 2.5 ($1.33M) and Mistral ($0.70M). We analyze the
distribution of errors per task and observe that the strongest models solve the
most tasks and rarely fail completely on any project. We discuss the
implications of these results for the feasibility of AI as a freelance
developer, the advantages and limitations of our automated benchmark approach,
and the gap between performance on structured tasks versus the true complexity
of real-world freelance jobs.

Motivation: 由于MIRP问题的高复杂度，现有的精确方法（如MIP）在实际操作中效率低下，而非MIP的启发式方法又因其高度约束性难以应用，因此需要新的方法解决问题。

Method: 提出了一种启发式方法，结合改进的Beam Search算法和迭代局部搜索程序。

Result: 在72个测试实例中，该方法改进了10个已知最优解，并在可接受的CPU时间内实现。

Conclusion: 该方法为MIRP问题提供了一种高效的解决方案，推动了MIRPLib的使用和结果比较。

Abstract: Maritime Inventory Routing Problem (MIRP) plays a crucial role in the
integration of global maritime commerce levels. However, there are still no
well-established methodologies capable of efficiently solving large MIRP
instances or their variants due to the high complexity of the problem. The
adoption of exact methods, typically based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
for daily operations is nearly impractical due to the CPU time required, as
planning must be executed multiple times while ensuring high-quality results
within acceptable time limits. Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently
applied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even
the construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et
al. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib,
aiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances.
However, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published
since then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons,
this study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical
optimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon,
single-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam
Search algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72
instances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution
for ten instances within an acceptable CPU time.

Method: 提出BARREL框架，旨在实现简洁且有边界意识的事实性推理，解决过思考和猜测问题。

Result: 实验显示，BARREL训练显著提升了DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型的可靠性，从39.33%提高到61.48%。

Conclusion: BARREL框架为构建更可靠的System 2 LRMs提供了启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. However, current LRMs
rarely admit ignorance or respond with "I don't know". Instead, they often
produce incorrect answers while showing undue confidence, raising concerns
about their factual reliability. In this work, we identify two pathological
reasoning patterns characterized by overthinking that contribute to the
overconfident and incorrect answers: last-minute guessing and second-thought
spiraling. To address these issues, we propose BARREL-a novel framework that
promotes concise and boundary-aware factual reasoning. Our experiments show
that BARREL-training increases the reliability of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
from 39.33% to 61.48%, while still achieving accuracy comparable to models
finetuned on reasoning data generated by R1. These results demonstrate that our
pilot study is inspiring to build more reliable and factual System 2 LRMs.

Method: FinMaster包含三个模块：FinSim（生成合成隐私合规的金融数据）、FinSuite（提供183个核心金融任务）和FinEval（统一评估接口）。

Abstract: Financial tasks are pivotal to global economic stability; however, their
execution faces challenges including labor intensive processes, low error
tolerance, data fragmentation, and tool limitations. Although large language
models (LLMs) have succeeded in various natural language processing tasks and
have shown potential in automating workflows through reasoning and contextual
understanding, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in finance lack
sufficient domain-specific data, have simplistic task design, and incomplete
evaluation frameworks. To address these gaps, this article presents FinMaster,
a comprehensive financial benchmark designed to systematically assess the
capabilities of LLM in financial literacy, accounting, auditing, and
consulting. Specifically, FinMaster comprises three main modules: i) FinSim,
which builds simulators that generate synthetic, privacy-compliant financial
data for companies to replicate market dynamics; ii) FinSuite, which provides
tasks in core financial domains, spanning 183 tasks of various types and
difficulty levels; and iii) FinEval, which develops a unified interface for
evaluation. Extensive experiments over state-of-the-art LLMs reveal critical
capability gaps in financial reasoning, with accuracy dropping from over 90% on
basic tasks to merely 40% on complex scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning.
This degradation exhibits the propagation of computational errors, where
single-metric calculations initially demonstrating 58% accuracy decreased to
37% in multimetric scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, FinMaster is the
first benchmark that covers full-pipeline financial workflows with challenging
tasks. We hope that FinMaster can bridge the gap between research and industry
practitioners, driving the adoption of LLMs in real-world financial practices
to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Automatic prompt generation plays a crucial role in enabling general-purpose
multi-agent systems to perform diverse tasks autonomously. Existing methods
typically evaluate prompts based on their immediate task performance,
overlooking the intrinsic qualities that determine their reliability. This
outcome-centric view not only limits interpretability but also fails to account
for the inherent stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In this work,
we bring attention to prompt stability-the consistency of model responses
across repeated executions-as a key factor for building robust and effective
prompt generation systems. To quantify this, we propose semantic stability as a
criterion for assessing the response consistency of prompts, and fine-tune a
LLaMA-based evaluator to measure it automatically across tasks. These
components have enabled us to develop the first stability-aware general-purpose
prompt generation system that leverages stability feedback to iteratively
enhance both prompt quality and system-level performance. Furthermore, we
establish a logical chain between prompt stability and task success by
analyzing the structural dependencies within our system, proving stability as a
necessary condition for effective system-level execution. Empirical results
across general and domain-specific tasks demonstrate that our stability-aware
framework improves both accuracy and output consistency. By shifting the focus
from one-off results to persistent reliability, our work offers a new
perspective on prompt design and contributes practical tools for building more
trustworthy general-purpose systems.

Conclusion: 研究强调了设计能够抵抗信息压力下刚性的认知架构的原则，并提供了避免反推断行为的建议。

Abstract: This study explores the emergence of counter-inferential behavior in natural
and artificial cognitive systems, that is, patterns in which agents
misattribute empirical success or suppress adaptation, leading to epistemic
rigidity or maladaptive stability. We analyze archetypal scenarios in which
such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance,
meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective
reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or
flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between
internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation
mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition,
human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior
as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise
well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving
minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design
principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under
informational stress.

Abstract: Daniel Dennett speculated in *Kinds of Minds* 1996: "Perhaps the kind of mind
you get when you add language to it is so different from the kind of mind you

work in AI can be seen as testing Dennett's thesis by exploring the performance
of AI systems with and without linguistic training. I argue that the success of
Large Language Models at inferential reasoning, limited though it may be,
supports Dennett's radical view about the effect of language on thought. I
suggest it is the abstractness and efficiency of linguistic encoding that lies
behind the capacity of LLMs to perform inferences across a wide range of
domains. In a slogan, language makes inference computationally tractable. I
assess what these results in AI indicate about the role of language in the
workings of our own biological minds.

Motivation: 传统FAQ检索方法常依赖单一模型，难以捕捉多样用户查询的细微差异，因此提出多智能体框架以解决这一问题。

Method: 采用基于Attentive Reasoning Queries（ARQs）的结构化推理方法，结合多个专业智能体和法官智能体进行重排序；使用差异化少样本示例策略增强多样性。

Abstract: Modern applications require accurate and efficient retrieval of information
in response to user queries. Mapping user utterances to the most relevant
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) is a crucial component of these systems.
Traditional approaches often rely on a single model or technique, which may not
capture the nuances of diverse user inquiries. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-agent framework for FAQ annotation that combines multiple specialized
agents with different approaches and a judge agent that reranks candidates to
produce optimal results. Our agents utilize a structured reasoning approach
inspired by Attentive Reasoning Queries (ARQs), which guides them through
systematic reasoning steps using targeted, task-specific JSON queries. Our
framework features a specialized few-shot example strategy, where each agent
receives different few-shots, enhancing ensemble diversity and coverage of the
query space. We evaluate our framework on a real-world banking dataset as well
as public benchmark datasets (LCQMC and FiQA), demonstrating significant
improvements over single-agent approaches across multiple metrics, including a
14% increase in Top-1 accuracy, an 18% increase in Top-5 accuracy, and a 12%
improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on our dataset, and similar gains on public
benchmarks when compared with traditional single agent annotation techniques.
Our framework is particularly effective at handling ambiguous queries, making
it well-suited for deployment in production applications while showing strong
generalization capabilities across different domains and languages.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful alternative to parameter
scaling for improving language model performance on complex reasoning tasks.
While existing methods have shown strong performance gains under fixed compute
budgets, there has been little focus on optimally utilizing that budget during
inference. In this work, we introduce A*-decoding, a search-based
inference-time strategy that builds on the A* search algorithm to optimally
utilize a fixed compute budget by prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths
during generation. We frame language model decoding as a structured search in a
state space of partial solutions, applying the A* transition model to identify
promising continuations guided by an external process supervision signal. In
our experiments, A*-decoding reaches the performance levels of strong inference
scaling baselines like best-of-N and particle filtering while using up to 3x
fewer tokens and 30% fewer PRM passes under equivalent compute budgets. On the
MATH500 and AIME 2024 benchmarks, A*-decoding enables Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to
match the performance of the 70x larger Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, and allows
Qwen3-1.7B to reach o1-like reasoning accuracy. These results highlight the
power of structured search in decoding, offering an alternative to brute-force
sampling or scale-driven gains. Our work demonstrates how thoughtful
inference-time strategies can enhance reasoning in SLMs, pointing toward future

Result: ESWM表现出极高的样本效率，能够快速适应环境变化，并支持探索和导航任务，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: ESWM为通过稀疏记忆构建环境模型提供了有效解决方案，展示了类似动物大脑的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Many animals possess a remarkable capacity to rapidly construct flexible
mental models of their environments. These world models are crucial for
ethologically relevant behaviors such as navigation, exploration, and planning.
The ability to form episodic memories and make inferences based on these sparse
experiences is believed to underpin the efficiency and adaptability of these
models in the brain. Here, we ask: Can a neural network learn to construct a
spatial model of its surroundings from sparse and disjoint episodic memories?
We formulate the problem in a simulated world and propose a novel framework,
the Episodic Spatial World Model (ESWM), as a potential answer. We show that
ESWM is highly sample-efficient, requiring minimal observations to construct a
robust representation of the environment. It is also inherently adaptive,
allowing for rapid updates when the environment changes. In addition, we
demonstrate that ESWM readily enables near-optimal strategies for exploring
novel environments and navigating between arbitrary points, all without the
need for additional training.

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过在玩具领域蒸馏长链思维预热模型，再用少量目标域数据微调，解决数据稀缺下推理LLMs训练问题。

Motivation: 传统RLVR或CoT蒸馏方法依赖大量数据，本文旨在数据稀缺环境下高效训练推理能力的LLMs。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 在K&K逻辑题领域蒸馏长链思维预热模型；2) 用少量目标域数据RLVR微调预热模型。

Result: 预热模型在多项任务表现更优，且RLVR训练后保持跨域泛化性，同时提升样本效率。

Conclusion: 预热方法在数据稀缺环境下显著提升推理LLMs的训练效果和样本效率。

Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with
carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on
extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of
quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage
training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the
first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain,
namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning
skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a
limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this
two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone
facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a
range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro. $(ii)$ When both
the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small
dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the
base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain
cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$
Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall
sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the
promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce
environments.

Motivation: 旨在开发一种无需依赖假设或模板的方法，直接解释Transformer模型中注意力头的功能角色。

Method: 提出了因果头门控（CHG）方法，通过学习头的软门并基于其对任务性能的影响进行分类，适用于任何标准的下一个词预测任务。

Result: CHG在多个LLAMA 3模型和多样化任务中表现出色，能揭示因果性见解，并发现LLMs中存在稀疏子电路。

Conclusion: CHG为解释注意力头的功能角色提供了新视角，揭示了LLMs的低模块性和任务机制的分离性。

Abstract: We present causal head gating (CHG), a scalable method for interpreting the
functional roles of attention heads in transformer models. CHG learns soft
gates over heads and assigns them a causal taxonomy - facilitating,
interfering, or irrelevant - based on their impact on task performance. Unlike
prior approaches in mechanistic interpretability, which are hypothesis-driven
and require prompt templates or target labels, CHG applies directly to any
dataset using standard next-token prediction. We evaluate CHG across multiple
large language models (LLMs) in the Llama 3 model family and diverse tasks,
including syntax, commonsense, and mathematical reasoning, and show that CHG
scores yield causal - not merely correlational - insight, validated via
ablation and causal mediation analyses. We also introduce contrastive CHG, a
variant that isolates sub-circuits for specific task components. Our findings
reveal that LLMs contain multiple sparse, sufficient sub-circuits, that
individual head roles depend on interactions with others (low modularity), and
that instruction following and in-context learning rely on separable
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）的元认知能力，即它们是否能监控和报告自身的激活模式，并通过神经反馈范式量化了这种能力。研究发现LLMs能学习和控制部分激活模式，但其能力受限。

Motivation: 随着社会对LLMs依赖的增加，了解其元认知能力的限制，尤其是在监控内部激活方面的能力，对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 采用神经反馈范式，通过提供句子-标签对来训练LLMs报告和控制其内部激活模式。

Result: LLMs能够学习和控制部分激活模式，但其性能受示例数量、目标神经方向的可解释性和方差解释率的影响。

Conclusion: LLMs的元认知能力有限，仅能监控部分神经机制，这对AI安全有重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they
actually use to solve tasks, but they can also fail to do so. This suggests
some degree of metacognition -- the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive
processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognitive abilities
enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might obscure
their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms
designed to detect harmful behaviors. Given society's increased reliance on
these models, it is critical that we understand the limits of their
metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal
activations. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired
neurofeedback paradigm designed to quantify the ability of LLMs to explicitly
report and control their activation patterns. By presenting models with
sentence-label pairs where labels correspond to sentence-elicited internal
activations along specific directions in the neural representation space, we
demonstrate that LLMs can learn to report and control these activations. The
performance varies with several factors: the number of example pairs provided,
the semantic interpretability of the target neural direction, and the variance
explained by that direction. These results reveal a "metacognitive space" with
dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can
monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms. Our findings provide
empirical evidence quantifying metacognitive capabilities in LLMs, with
significant implications for AI safety.

Motivation: 在医学、经济学等高风险领域，可靠的因果推断至关重要，但目前不清楚大语言模型是否能胜任。现有基准任务过于简化，忽略了统计陷阱，故需更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出CausalPitfalls基准，包含结构化挑战和评分标准，通过直接提示和代码辅助提示两种协议评估模型，并与人类专家评分对比验证。

Result: 发现当前大语言模型在统计因果推断中存在显著局限性，CausalPitfalls提供了定量指标和指导。

Conclusion: CausalPitfalls为开发可信的因果推理系统提供了重要基准和支持。

Abstract: Reliable causal inference is essential for making decisions in high-stakes
areas like medicine, economics, and public policy. However, it remains unclear
whether large language models (LLMs) can handle rigorous and trustworthy
statistical causal inference. Current benchmarks usually involve simplified
tasks. For example, these tasks might only ask LLMs to identify semantic causal
relationships or draw conclusions directly from raw data. As a result, models
may overlook important statistical pitfalls, such as Simpson's paradox or
selection bias. This oversight limits the applicability of LLMs in the real
world. To address these limitations, we propose CausalPitfalls, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capability of LLMs in overcoming
common causal inference pitfalls. Our benchmark features structured challenges
across multiple difficulty levels, each paired with grading rubrics. This
approach allows us to quantitatively measure both causal reasoning capabilities
and the reliability of LLMs' responses. We evaluate models using two protocols:
(1) direct prompting, which assesses intrinsic causal reasoning, and (2)
code-assisted prompting, where models generate executable code for explicit
statistical analysis. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of this judge
by comparing its scoring with assessments from human experts. Our results
reveal significant limitations in current LLMs when performing statistical
causal inference. The CausalPitfalls benchmark provides essential guidance and
quantitative metrics to advance the development of trustworthy causal reasoning
systems.

Abstract: We compare three methods of familiarizing a human with an artificial
intelligence (AI) teammate ("agent") prior to operation in a collaborative,
fast-paced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) environment. In
a between-subjects user study (n=60), participants either read documentation
about the agent, trained alongside the agent prior to the mission, or were
given no familiarization. Results showed that the most valuable information
about the agent included details of its decision-making algorithms and its
relative strengths and weaknesses compared to the human. This information
allowed the familiarization groups to form sophisticated team strategies more
quickly than the control group. Documentation-based familiarization led to the
fastest adoption of these strategies, but also biased participants towards
risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores. Participants familiarized
through direct interaction were able to infer much of the same information
through observation, and were more willing to take risks and experiment with
different control modes, but reported weaker understanding of the agent's
internal processes. Significant differences were seen between individual
participants' risk tolerance and methods of AI interaction, which should be
considered when designing human-AI control interfaces. Based on our findings,
we recommend a human-AI team familiarization method that combines AI
documentation, structured in-situ training, and exploratory interaction.

Motivation: 为了确保LRMs在复杂问题解决中的中间推理过程的可靠性，需要评估其思维草稿的忠实性。

Method: 提出了一个反事实干预框架，通过两个维度评估忠实性：1) 草稿内忠实性（Intra-Draft Faithfulness），2) 草稿至答案忠实性（Draft-to-Answer Faithfulness）。

Result: 实验表明，当前LRMs对中间推理步骤的忠实性具有选择性，且与思维草稿的结论一致性较差。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在高级LRMs中实现更忠实和可解释推理的必要性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities
in complex problem-solving by introducing a thinking draft that enables
multi-path Chain-of-Thought explorations before producing final answers.
Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial
for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper,
we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously
evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary
dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual
reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft
conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer
Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent
with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding
logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our
findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to
intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the
draft conclusions. These results underscore the need for more faithful and
interpretable reasoning in advanced LRMs.

Motivation: 商业LLM服务隐藏推理过程，用户无法验证令牌使用情况，可能导致账单膨胀问题。

Method: CoIn通过令牌指纹的哈希树验证数量，并通过嵌入相关性匹配检测伪造内容。

Result: 实验显示CoIn能94.7%准确检测令牌膨胀，恢复账单透明性。

Conclusion: CoIn有效解决了LLM服务中的透明度问题，提升了账单可信度。

Abstract: As post-training techniques evolve, large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly augmented with structured multi-step reasoning abilities, often
optimized through reinforcement learning. These reasoning-enhanced models
outperform standard LLMs on complex tasks and now underpin many commercial LLM
APIs. However, to protect proprietary behavior and reduce verbosity, providers
typically conceal the reasoning traces while returning only the final answer.
This opacity introduces a critical transparency gap: users are billed for
invisible reasoning tokens, which often account for the majority of the cost,
yet have no means to verify their authenticity. This opens the door to token
count inflation, where providers may overreport token usage or inject
synthetic, low-effort tokens to inflate charges. To address this issue, we
propose CoIn, a verification framework that audits both the quantity and
semantic validity of hidden tokens. CoIn constructs a verifiable hash tree from
token embedding fingerprints to check token counts, and uses embedding-based
relevance matching to detect fabricated reasoning content. Experiments
demonstrate that CoIn, when deployed as a trusted third-party auditor, can
effectively detect token count inflation with a success rate reaching up to
94.7%, showing the strong ability to restore billing transparency in opaque LLM
services. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Evaluating ecological time series is critical for benchmarking model
performance in many important applications, including predicting greenhouse gas
fluxes, capturing carbon-nitrogen dynamics, and monitoring hydrological cycles.
Traditional numerical metrics (e.g., R-squared, root mean square error) have
been widely used to quantify the similarity between modeled and observed
ecosystem variables, but they often fail to capture domain-specific temporal
patterns critical to ecological processes. As a result, these methods are often
accompanied by expert visual inspection, which requires substantial human labor
and limits the applicability to large-scale evaluation. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates metric learning with
large language model (LLM)-based natural language policy extraction to develop
interpretable evaluation criteria. The proposed method processes pairwise
annotations and implements a policy optimization mechanism to generate and
combine different assessment metrics. The results obtained on multiple datasets
for evaluating the predictions of crop gross primary production and carbon
dioxide flux have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method in
capturing target assessment preferences, including both synthetically generated
and expert-annotated model comparisons. The proposed framework bridges the gap
between numerical metrics and expert knowledge while providing interpretable
evaluation policies that accommodate the diverse needs of different ecosystem
modeling studies.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of complex designs while
minimizing waste, but faces challenges related to defects and process
anomalies. This study presents a novel multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation-based framework that automates anomaly detection across various
Additive Manufacturing processes leveraging retrieved information from
literature, including images and descriptive text, rather than training
datasets. This framework integrates text and image retrieval from scientific
literature and multimodal generation models to perform zero-shot anomaly
identification, classification, and explanation generation in a Laser Powder
Bed Fusion setting. The proposed framework is evaluated on four L-PBF
manufacturing datasets from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, featuring various
printer makes, models, and materials. This evaluation demonstrates the
framework's adaptability and generalizability across diverse images without
requiring additional training. Comparative analysis using Qwen2-VL-2B and
GPT-4o-mini as MLLM within the proposed framework highlights that GPT-4o-mini
outperforms Qwen2-VL-2B and proportional random baseline in manufacturing
anomalies classification. Additionally, the evaluation of the RAG system
confirms that incorporating retrieval mechanisms improves average accuracy by
12% by reducing the risk of hallucination and providing additional information.
The proposed framework can be continuously updated by integrating emerging
research, allowing seamless adaptation to the evolving landscape of AM
technologies. This scalable, automated, and zero-shot-capable framework
streamlines AM anomaly analysis, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The selection of base station sites is a critical challenge in 5G network
planning, which requires efficient optimization of coverage, cost, user

human expertise, suffer from inefficiencies and are limited to an unsatisfied
planning-construction consistency. Existing AI tools, despite improving
efficiency in certain aspects, still struggle to meet the dynamic network
conditions and multi-objective needs of telecom operators' networks. To address
these challenges, we propose TelePlanNet, an AI-driven framework tailored for
the selection of base station sites, integrating a three-layer architecture for
efficient planning and large-scale automation. By leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for real-time user input processing and intent alignment with
base station planning, combined with training the planning model using the
improved group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning, the
proposed TelePlanNet can effectively address multi-objective optimization,
evaluates candidate sites, and delivers practical solutions. Experiments
results show that the proposed TelePlanNet can improve the consistency to 78%,
which is superior to the manual methods, providing telecom operators with an
efficient and scalable tool that significantly advances cellular network
planning.

Abstract: Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene
classification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video
analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a
growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret
video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key
obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models
have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames
or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of
events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making.
Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning
approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic
perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured
into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an
approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide
stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing
trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the
research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents
that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and
analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content
generation. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive
perception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing
the boundaries of video understanding.

Abstract: Despite efforts to better understand the constraints that operate on
single-step parallel (aka "package", "multiple") revision, very little work has
been carried out on how to extend the model to the iterated case. A recent
paper by Delgrande & Jin outlines a range of relevant rationality postulates.
While many of these are plausible, they lack an underlying unifying
explanation. We draw on recent work on iterated parallel contraction to offer a
general method for extending serial iterated belief revision operators to
handle parallel change. This method, based on a family of order aggregators
known as TeamQueue aggregators, provides a principled way to recover the
independently plausible properties that can be found in the literature, without
yielding the more dubious ones.

Result: DrugPilot在简单、多重和多轮任务上的完成率分别为98.0%、93.5%和64.0%，优于现有代理。

Conclusion: DrugPilot通过创新的参数化推理架构显著提升了药物发现中的LLM应用效果。

Abstract: In the field of AI4Science, large-scale language models (LLMs) show great
potential to parse complex scientific semantics, integrate cross-disciplinary
knowledge, and assist critical task research. However, in the field of drug
discovery, despite the optimization through professional data pre-training,
context window expansion, and internet search, the existing LLMs are still
facing challenges such as massive multi-modal and heterogeneous data
processing, domain knowledge dynamic updating delay, and insufficient
confidence in predicting the results of complex computational tasks. To address
these challenges, we propose the DrugPilot, an LLM-based agent with
parameterized reasoning for drug discovery. DrugPilot addresses key limitations
of traditional end-to-end LLM prediction approaches through its parametric
inference architecture. This agent system supports major phases of the drug
discovery pipeline, facilitating automated planning and execution of
multi-stage research tasks. To address the critical challenge of multi-modal
drug data analysis (incorporating both public datasets and user-submitted
data), we developed an interactive parameterized memory pool. This innovative
component standardizes real-world drug data into parametric representations,
simultaneously enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in multi-turn dialogue
while mitigating the information loss inherent in text-based data transmission.
Additionally, we created a drug instruct dataset across 8 essential drug
discovery tasks for model fine-tuning and evaluation. Based on the Berkeley
function calling evaluation framework, DrugPilot demonstrated the most advanced
tool calling capabilities on our drug discovery tool instruction dataset,
outperforming existing agents (e.g., ReAct, LoT). Specifically, it achieves
task completion rates of 98.0%, 93.5%, and 64.0% on simple, multiple, and
multi-turn tasks, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出Vittle方法，通过信息瓶颈原理增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 现有方法需要更多指令数据或更大模型架构，成本高昂，因此从表示学习角度改进MLLMs的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈（IB）原理，推导出MLLMs的变分下界，提出视觉指令瓶颈调优（Vittle）方法。

Result: 在45个数据集（包括30种偏移场景）上的实验表明，Vittle通过最小充分表示学习提升了MLLMs的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Vittle是一种有效的低成本方法，能显著提升MLLMs在分布偏移下的性能。

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer
performance degradation when encountering unfamiliar queries under distribution
shifts. Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require
either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of
which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we
take an alternative approach to enhance the robustness of MLLMs under
distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by
the information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound
of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction
Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of
Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness
metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of three MLLMs on open-ended and
closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45
datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently
improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a
minimal sufficient representation.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于交通运输网络，还能推广到其他领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as an important paradigm to solve
combinatorial optimization problems primarily due to its ability to learn
heuristics that can generalize across problem instances. However, integrating
external knowledge that will steer combinatorial optimization problem solutions
towards domain appropriate outcomes remains an extremely challenging task. In
this paper, we propose the first RL solution that uses constrained action
spaces to guide the normalized cut problem towards pre-defined template
instances. Using transportation networks as an example domain, we create a
Wedge and Ring Transformer that results in graph partitions that are shaped in
form of Wedges and Rings and which are likely to be closer to natural optimal
partitions. However, our approach is general as it is based on principles that
can be generalized to other domains.

TL;DR: SPLIT-RAG是一种多智能体RAG框架，通过语义图分割和协作子图检索解决现有RAG系统在大规模知识图谱上的效率-准确性权衡问题。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在扩展到大知识图谱时，面临着检索效率与准确性之间的权衡问题。现有方法往往依赖于单一图检索，导致简单查询时不必要的延迟和复杂多跳问题的碎片化推理。

Method: 提出SPLIT-RAG框架，采用问题驱动的语义图分割和协作子图检索。通过语义划分链接信息，利用类型专门化的知识库实现多智能体RAG，并通过轻量级LLM代理管理分割后的子图，激活相关分区进行检索，减少搜索空间。

Result: 实验验证表明，SPLIT-RAG在效率和准确性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPLIT-RAG通过语义分割和多智能体协作优化了RAG系统在大规模知识图谱中的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems empower large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge, yet struggle with efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs when scaling to large knowledge graphs. Existing approaches often
rely on monolithic graph retrieval, incurring unnecessary latency for simple
queries and fragmented reasoning for complex multi-hop questions. To address
these challenges, this paper propose SPLIT-RAG, a multi-agent RAG framework
that addresses these limitations with question-driven semantic graph
partitioning and collaborative subgraph retrieval. The innovative framework
first create Semantic Partitioning of Linked Information, then use the
Type-Specialized knowledge base to achieve Multi-Agent RAG. The attribute-aware
graph segmentation manages to divide knowledge graphs into semantically
coherent subgraphs, ensuring subgraphs align with different query types, while
lightweight LLM agents are assigned to partitioned subgraphs, and only relevant
partitions are activated during retrieval, thus reduce search space while
enhancing efficiency. Finally, a hierarchical merging module resolves
inconsistencies across subgraph-derived answers through logical verifications.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates considerable improvements
compared to existing approaches.

TL;DR: VeRecycle是一个框架，用于在系统动态仅在状态子集变化时高效重用概率证书，减少重新认证的计算成本。

Motivation: 现实中的自主系统面临多种不确定性，但现有的概率认证方法在系统动态变化时需要完全重新认证，计算成本高。

Method: 提出了VeRecycle框架，通过局部状态空间变化的假设，高效重用概率证书。

Result: 实验证明VeRecycle既能节省计算资源，又能提供竞争性的概率保证。

Conclusion: VeRecycle为非线性随机动力系统的认证提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in the real world encounter a range of
uncertainties. Probabilistic neural Lyapunov certification is a powerful
approach to proving safety of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. When
faced with changes beyond the modeled uncertainties, e.g., unidentified
obstacles, probabilistic certificates must be transferred to the new system
dynamics. However, even when the changes are localized in a known part of the
state space, state-of-the-art requires complete re-certification, which is
particularly costly for neural certificates. We introduce VeRecycle, the first
framework to formally reclaim guarantees for discrete-time stochastic dynamical
systems. VeRecycle efficiently reuses probabilistic certificates when the
system dynamics deviate only in a given subset of states. We present a general
theoretical justification and algorithmic implementation. Our experimental
evaluation shows scenarios where VeRecycle both saves significant computational
effort and achieves competitive probabilistic guarantees in compositional
neural control.

Method: 使用多跨度演化策略和解缠组件区分活跃与稳定特征。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上大幅超越现有方法，最高提升22.7%的MRR。

Conclusion: DiMNet有效捕获子图内部交互和语义变化，显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs
(KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge
by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future
facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in
recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent
subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive
reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling
subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural
interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs.
2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic
changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process.
Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network
(DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution
strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical
neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between
subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic
change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates
nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of
historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on
four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial
performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7%
in MRR.

Abstract: Mental health risk is a critical global public health challenge,
necessitating innovative and reliable assessment methods. With the development
of large language models (LLMs), they stand out to be a promising tool for
explainable mental health care applications. Nevertheless, existing approaches
predominantly rely on subjective textual mental records, which can be distorted
by inherent mental uncertainties, leading to inconsistent and unreliable
predictions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ProMind-LLM.
We investigate an innovative approach integrating objective behavior data as
complementary information alongside subjective mental records for robust mental
health risk assessment. Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive
pipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental
health contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of
numerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of its predictions. Evaluations of two
real-world datasets, PMData and Globem, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, achieving substantial improvements over general LLMs. We
anticipate that ProMind-LLM will pave the way for more dependable,
interpretable, and scalable mental health case solutions.

Motivation: 深度学习在教育领域的应用存在局限性，如缺乏个性化、忽视非评估材料以及知识获取与行为模式的关联性不足。KMaP旨在通过多任务方法解决这些问题。

Method: 提出KMaP模型，通过聚类分析生成个性化学生表征，同时建模学生知识和行为，并预测未来学习资源偏好。

Conclusion: KMaP有效提升了学生知识跟踪和行为建模的个性化程度，为教育领域的深度学习应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite advances in deep learning for education, student knowledge tracing
and behavior modeling face persistent challenges: limited personalization,
inadequate modeling of diverse learning activities (especially non-assessed
materials), and overlooking the interplay between knowledge acquisition and
behavioral patterns. Practical limitations, such as fixed-size sequence
segmentation, frequently lead to the loss of contextual information vital for
personalized learning. Moreover, reliance on student performance on assessed
materials limits the modeling scope, excluding non-assessed interactions like
lectures. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose Knowledge Modeling and
Material Prediction (KMaP), a stateful multi-task approach designed for
personalized and simultaneous modeling of student knowledge and behavior. KMaP
employs clustering-based student profiling to create personalized student
representations, improving predictions of future learning resource preferences.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm significant behavioral
differences across student clusters and validate the efficacy of the KMaP
model.

Result: 实验证明了该方法的鲁棒性，能够解决多种巡逻模型中的实例。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了有限记忆策略中的内存分配问题，提升了策略的实用性。

Abstract: Adversarial Patrolling games form a subclass of Security games where a
Defender moves between locations, guarding vulnerable targets. The main
algorithmic problem is constructing a strategy for the Defender that minimizes
the worst damage an Attacker can cause. We focus on the class of finite-memory
(also known as regular) Defender's strategies that experimentally outperformed
other competing classes. A finite-memory strategy can be seen as a positional
strategy on a finite set of states. Each state consists of a pair of a location
and a certain integer value--called memory. Existing algorithms improve the
transitional probabilities between the states but require that the available
memory size itself is assigned at each location manually. Choosing the right
memory assignment is a well-known open and hard problem that hinders the
usability of finite-memory strategies. We solve this issue by developing a
general method that iteratively changes the memory assignment. Our algorithm
can be used in connection with \emph{any} black-box strategy optimization tool.
We evaluate our method on various experiments and show its robustness by
solving instances of various patrolling models.

Result: 在多个基准测试中性能提升13.4%，轻量级导航器（<3K参数）使小模型达到接近大模型的效果。

Conclusion: RLoT具有强适应性和迁移性，为提升LLM推理能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), the token-level
autoregressive nature constrains their complex reasoning capabilities. To
enhance LLM reasoning, inference-time techniques, including
Chain/Tree/Graph-of-Thought(s), successfully improve the performance, as they
are fairly cost-effective by guiding reasoning through sophisticated logical
structures without modifying LLMs' parameters. However, these manually
predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse
tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT),
where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL)
to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design
five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the
reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable
logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according
to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
(AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek)
illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to
13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to
make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts. Moreover, the RL
navigator demonstrates strong transferability: a model trained on one specific
LLM-task pair can effectively generalize to unseen LLMs and tasks. Our code is
open-source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RL-LLM-Reasoning-1A30 for

Motivation: 移动GUI代理在执行任务时由于缺乏对目标应用的深入理解，容易在任务规划中迷失方向，因此需要一种有效的规划方法。

Method: 提出SPlanner模块，利用扩展有限状态机（EFSMs）建模应用逻辑，分解用户指令为功能序列并生成执行路径，再通过LLM转换为自然语言计划。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，SPlanner与Qwen2.5-VL-72B结合使用时任务成功率达63.8%，比无规划辅助时提高了28.8个百分点。

Conclusion: SPlanner能有效解决GUI代理的任务规划问题，生成简洁可执行的计划，显著提升任务完成率。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents execute user commands by directly interacting with the
graphical user interface (GUI) of mobile devices, demonstrating significant
potential to enhance user convenience. However, these agents face considerable
challenges in task planning, as they must continuously analyze the GUI and
generate operation instructions step by step. This process often leads to
difficulties in making accurate task plans, as GUI agents lack a deep
understanding of how to effectively use the target applications, which can
cause them to become "lost" during task execution. To address the task planning
issue, we propose SPlanner, a plug-and-play planning module to generate
execution plans that guide vision language model(VLMs) in executing tasks. The
proposed planning module utilizes extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to
model the control logits and configurations of mobile applications. It then
decomposes a user instruction into a sequence of primary function modeled in
EFSMs, and generate the execution path by traversing the EFSMs. We further
refine the execution path into a natural language plan using an LLM. The final
plan is concise and actionable, and effectively guides VLMs to generate
interactive GUI actions to accomplish user tasks. SPlanner demonstrates strong
performance on dynamic benchmarks reflecting real-world mobile usage. On the
AndroidWorld benchmark, SPlanner achieves a 63.8% task success rate when paired
with Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the VLM executor, yielding a 28.8 percentage point
improvement compared to using Qwen2.5-VL-72B without planning assistance.

Conclusion: MMoLRE通过有效建模任务共性和特性，解决了参数冲突问题，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables the efficient transfer of extra knowledge
acquired from other tasks. The high correlation between multimodal sentiment
analysis (MSA) and multimodal emotion recognition (MER) supports their joint
training. However, existing methods primarily employ hard parameter sharing,
ignoring parameter conflicts caused by complex task correlations. In this
paper, we present a novel MTL method for MSA and MER, termed Multimodal Mixture
of Low-Rank Experts (MMoLRE). MMoLRE utilizes shared and task-specific experts
to distinctly model common and unique task characteristics, thereby avoiding
parameter conflicts. Additionally, inspired by low-rank structures in the
Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, we design low-rank expert networks to
reduce parameter and computational overhead as the number of experts increases.
Extensive experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI benchmarks demonstrate that
MMoLRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MSA task and competitive
results on the MER task.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems empower large language models
(LLMs) to access external knowledge during inference. Recent advances have
enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving
information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines.
However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only
metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM
to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and
limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary
models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework
that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a
Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG.
s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over
70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across
six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Training large reasoning models (LRMs) with reinforcement learning in STEM
domains is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable
problem sets. Existing synthesis methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting,
often generate oversimplified or uncheckable data, limiting model advancement
on complex tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce SHARP, a unified
approach to Synthesizing High-quality Aligned Reasoning Problems for LRMs
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). SHARP encompasses a
strategic set of self-alignment principles -- targeting graduate and
Olympiad-level difficulty, rigorous logical consistency, and unambiguous,
verifiable answers -- and a structured three-phase framework (Alignment,
Instantiation, Inference) that ensures thematic diversity and fine-grained
control over problem generation. We implement SHARP by leveraging a
state-of-the-art LRM to infer and verify challenging STEM questions, then
employ a reinforcement learning loop to refine the model's reasoning through
verifiable reward signals. Experiments on benchmarks such as GPQA demonstrate
that SHARP-augmented training substantially outperforms existing methods,
markedly improving complex reasoning accuracy and pushing LRM performance
closer to expert-level proficiency. Our contributions include the SHARP
strategy, framework design, end-to-end implementation, and experimental
evaluation of its effectiveness in elevating LRM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Mathematical modeling is a cornerstone of scientific discovery and
engineering practice, enabling the translation of real-world problems into
formal systems across domains such as physics, biology, and economics. Unlike
mathematical reasoning, which assumes a predefined formulation, modeling
requires open-ended problem analysis, abstraction, and principled
formalization. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning
capabilities, they fall short in rigorous model construction, limiting their
utility in real-world problem-solving. To this end, we formalize the task of
LLM-powered real-world mathematical modeling, where agents must analyze
problems, construct domain-appropriate formulations, and generate complete
end-to-end solutions. We introduce MM-Bench, a curated benchmark of 111
problems from the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM), spanning the
years 2000 to 2025 and across ten diverse domains such as physics, biology, and
economics. To tackle this task, we propose MM-Agent, an expert-inspired
framework that decomposes mathematical modeling into four stages: open-ended
problem analysis, structured model formulation, computational problem solving,
and report generation. Experiments on MM-Bench show that MM-Agent significantly
outperforms baseline agents, achieving an 11.88\% improvement over human expert
solutions while requiring only 15 minutes and \$0.88 per task using GPT-4o.
Furthermore, under official MCM/ICM protocols, MM-Agent assisted two
undergraduate teams in winning the Finalist Award (\textbf{top 2.0\% among
27,456 teams}) in MCM/ICM 2025, demonstrating its practical effectiveness as a
modeling copilot. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DSMentor的新型推理时优化框架，利用课程学习策略提升LLM代理在复杂数据科学任务中的表现。

Motivation: 现有研究忽略了问题解决顺序的重要性，本文旨在通过课程学习策略优化LLM代理的性能。

Method: DSMentor框架按难度递增组织任务，并引入长期记忆机制以积累和利用知识。

Result: 实验表明，DSMentor在DSEval和QRData基准上提升了5.2%的通过率，在因果推理任务中比GPT-4高出8.8%。

Conclusion: DSMentor通过模仿人类学习过程的策略，为LLM性能提升开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown promising performance in
generating code for solving complex data science problems. Recent studies
primarily focus on enhancing in-context learning through improved search,
sampling, and planning techniques, while overlooking the importance of the
order in which problems are tackled during inference. In this work, we develop
a novel inference-time optimization framework, referred to as DSMentor, which
leverages curriculum learning -- a strategy that introduces simpler task first
and progressively moves to more complex ones as the learner improves -- to
enhance LLM agent performance in challenging data science tasks. Our
mentor-guided framework organizes data science tasks in order of increasing
difficulty and incorporates a growing long-term memory to retain prior
experiences, guiding the agent's learning progression and enabling more
effective utilization of accumulated knowledge. We evaluate DSMentor through
extensive experiments on DSEval and QRData benchmarks. Experiments show that
DSMentor using Claude-3.5-Sonnet improves the pass rate by up to 5.2% on DSEval
and QRData compared to baseline agents. Furthermore, DSMentor demonstrates
stronger causal reasoning ability, improving the pass rate by 8.8% on the
causality problems compared to GPT-4 using Program-of-Thoughts prompts. Our
work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for
accumulating and utilizing knowledge during inference, mirroring the human
learning process and opening new avenues for improving LLM performance through
curriculum-based inference optimization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态重规划框架，利用实时延迟数据优化公共交通路线，推式方法显著优于拉式方法。

Motivation: 现有解决方案无法充分利用实时延迟数据，导致用户错失更早到达的机会，因此需要一种系统级的动态重规划框架。

Method: 提出了推式和拉式两种动态重规划方法，推式由服务器主动监控和调整路线。

Result: 实验表明推式方法显著优于拉式方法，动态重规划带来了显著的到达时间节省。

Conclusion: 利用实时延迟数据的动态重规划能显著优化用户行程，推式方法更具优势。

Abstract: Delays in public transport are common, often impacting users through
prolonged travel times and missed transfers. Existing solutions for handling
delays remain limited; backup plans based on historical data miss opportunities
for earlier arrivals, while snapshot planning accounts for current delays but
not future ones. With the growing availability of live delay data, users can
adjust their journeys in real-time. However, the literature lacks a framework
that fully exploits this advantage for system-scale dynamic replanning. To
address this, we formalise the dynamic replanning problem in public transport
routing and propose two solutions: a "pull" approach, where users manually
request replanning, and a novel "push" approach, where the server proactively
monitors and adjusts journeys. Our experiments show that the push approach
outperforms the pull approach, achieving significant speedups. The results also
reveal substantial arrival time savings enabled by dynamic replanning.

Motivation: 现有研究多限于简化的二维小规模场景，忽视了现实环境扰动和异质性，需在三维大规模场景中探索更实用的防御策略。

Method: 提出EMFAC框架，利用表示学习和均值场方法实现高效协调；引入轻量级注意力机制优化观测和决策。

Result: EMFAC在模拟中表现优于基线方法，收敛速度和性能均有提升，并在小规模现实实验中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: EMFAC为解决大规模异质防御问题提供了有效方案，适用于复杂三维场景。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and missile
technologies, perimeter-defense game between attackers and defenders for the
protection of critical regions have become increasingly complex and
strategically significant across a wide range of domains. However, existing
studies predominantly focus on small-scale, simplified two-dimensional
scenarios, often overlooking realistic environmental perturbations, motion
dynamics, and inherent heterogeneity--factors that pose substantial challenges
to real-world applicability. To bridge this gap, we investigate large-scale
heterogeneous perimeter-defense game in a three-dimensional setting,
incorporating realistic elements such as motion dynamics and wind fields. We
derive the Nash equilibrium strategies for both attackers and defenders,
characterize the victory regions, and validate our theoretical findings through
extensive simulations. To tackle large-scale heterogeneous control challenges
in defense strategies, we propose an Embedded Mean-Field Actor-Critic (EMFAC)
framework. EMFAC leverages representation learning to enable high-level action
aggregation in a mean-field manner, supporting scalable coordination among
defenders. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight agent-level attention
mechanism based on reward representation, which selectively filters
observations and mean-field information to enhance decision-making efficiency
and accelerate convergence in large-scale tasks. Extensive simulations across
varying scales demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of EMFAC, which
outperforms established baselines in both convergence speed and overall
performance. To further validate practicality, we test EMFAC in small-scale
real-world experiments and conduct detailed analyses, offering deeper insights
into the framework's effectiveness in complex scenarios.

Motivation: 探讨RLVR和蒸馏对模型能力与准确性影响的机制。

Method: 通过小模型实验分析RLVR和蒸馏对问题难度及回答质量的影响。

Result: RLVR仅提升简单问题的准确性而损害难题，蒸馏只有引入新知识时才提升能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RLVR和蒸馏如何影响模型的推理行为。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) enhances overall accuracy but fails to improve capability, while
distillation can improve both. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms
behind these phenomena. First, we demonstrate that RLVR does not improve
capability because it focuses on improving the accuracy of the less-difficult
questions to the detriment of the accuracy of the most difficult questions,
thereby leading to no improvement in capability. Second, we find that RLVR does
not merely increase the success probability for the less difficult questions,
but in our small model settings produces quality responses that were absent in
its output distribution before training. In addition, we show these responses
are neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords,
underscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third,
we show that while distillation reliably improves accuracy by learning strong
reasoning patterns, it only improves capability when new knowledge is
introduced. Moreover, when distilling only with reasoning patterns and no new
knowledge, the accuracy of the less-difficult questions improves to the
detriment of the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these
findings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape
reasoning behavior in language models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EVA框架，用于动态优化间接提示注入攻击，显著提高攻击成功率和跨场景适用性。

Motivation: 多模态代理在GUI环境中易受间接提示注入攻击，现有静态方法效果不佳，需动态优化攻击策略。

Method: 提出EVA框架，通过闭环优化动态调整攻击提示，结合代理的视觉注意力分布持续更新策略。

Result: 实验表明EVA在六种GUI代理中显著优于静态方法，且攻击模式可跨模型迁移，揭示代理的共同行为偏差。

Conclusion: EVA是红队测试和发现多模态代理决策漏洞的有力工具。

Abstract: As multimodal agents are increasingly trained to operate graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) to complete user tasks, they face a growing threat from
indirect prompt injection, attacks in which misleading instructions are
embedded into the agent's visual environment, such as popups or chat messages,
and misinterpreted as part of the intended task. A typical example is
environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence
agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these
emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt
injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by
continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and
updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response.
Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard
for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to
emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates
and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA
on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings
such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email
composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success
rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the
attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective
patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models,
revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that
evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming
agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal
decision making.

Motivation: 高风险行业（如核能和航空）使用实时监测来检测危险系统状态，类似的，LLMs也需要监测保障。本文旨在通过无监督方法预测有害输出，并防止高级模型的欺骗行为。

Method: 采用无监督方法，将正常行为作为基线，有害输出视为异常值。通过研究后门触发响应和模型内部行为特征，开发了Safety-Net多检测器框架，监测不同表示维度。

Result: 研究发现模型能够通过因果机制生成有害内容，并通过改变特征关系实现欺骗。Safety-Net框架在检测有害行为方面达到96%的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的无监督框架能够有效检测LLMs的有害输出，即使模型尝试通过多种方式逃避监测。

Abstract: High-risk industries like nuclear and aviation use real-time monitoring to
detect dangerous system conditions. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs)
need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful
AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats
normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study
focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input
phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe
content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key
challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface
correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately
evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an
unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans
exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display
distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our
study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that
capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and
2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our
findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms
and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear
representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we
developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different
representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when
information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual
monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using
our unsupervised ensemble approach.

Method: SCAN采用粗粒度的语义方法，将文档分为连贯区域，并通过微调目标检测模型实现高效布局分析。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), rich document analysis technologies for
applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and visual RAG are
gaining significant attention. Recent research indicates that using VLMs can
achieve better RAG performance, but processing rich documents still remains a
challenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this
paper, we present SCAN (\textbf{S}emanti\textbf{C} Document Layout
\textbf{AN}alysis), a novel approach enhancing both textual and visual
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems working with visually rich
documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components
with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with
processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that
divides documents into coherent regions covering continuous components. We
trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models with
sophisticated annotation datasets. Our experimental results across English and
Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual
RAG performance by up to 9.0\% and visual RAG performance by up to 6.4\%,
outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing

Motivation: 现有数据标注方法在长CoT推理中仅关注首次错误步骤及之前步骤，忽略了后续可能存在的正确推理步骤，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种新的数据标注方法，结合错误传播和错误终止概念，利用LLM生成标注数据，训练7B PRM模型。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在搜索指导、BoN和F1分数上优于现有开源PRMs，且数据效率和性能更优。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅稳定性强且泛化能力高，显著提升了PRMs的长CoT推理能力。

Abstract: Many studies focus on data annotation techniques for training effective PRMs.
However, current methods encounter a significant issue when applied to long CoT
reasoning processes: they tend to focus solely on the first incorrect step and
all preceding steps, assuming that all subsequent steps are incorrect. These
methods overlook the unique self-correction and reflection mechanisms inherent
in long CoT, where correct reasoning steps may still occur after initial
reasoning mistakes. To address this issue, we propose a novel data annotation
method for PRMs specifically designed to score the long CoT reasoning process.
Given that under the reflection pattern, correct and incorrect steps often
alternate, we introduce the concepts of Error Propagation and Error Cessation,
enhancing PRMs' ability to identify both effective self-correction behaviors
and reasoning based on erroneous steps. Leveraging an LLM-based judger for
annotation, we collect 1.7 million data samples to train a 7B PRM and evaluate
it at both solution and step levels. Experimental results demonstrate that
compared to existing open-source PRMs and PRMs trained on open-source datasets,
our PRM achieves superior performance across various metrics, including search
guidance, BoN, and F1 scores. Compared to widely used MC-based annotation
methods, our annotation approach not only achieves higher data efficiency but
also delivers superior performance. Detailed analysis is also conducted to
demonstrate the stability and generalizability of our method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code
generation from natural language queries. However, despite their extensive
knowledge and ability to produce high-quality code, LLMs often struggle with
contextual accuracy, particularly in evolving codebases. Current code search
and retrieval methods frequently lack robustness in both the quality and
contextual relevance of retrieved results, leading to suboptimal code
generation. This paper introduces a novel knowledge graph-based approach to
improve code search and retrieval leading to better quality of code generation
in the context of repository-level tasks. The proposed approach represents code
repositories as graphs, capturing structural and relational information for
enhanced context-aware code generation. Our framework employs a hybrid approach
for code retrieval to improve contextual relevance, track inter-file modular
dependencies, generate more robust code and ensure consistency with the
existing codebase. We benchmark the proposed approach on the Evolutionary Code
Benchmark (EvoCodeBench) dataset, a repository-level code generation benchmark,
and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baseline
approach. These findings suggest that knowledge graph based code generation
could advance robust, context-sensitive coding assistance tools.

Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）在因果推理任务中表现不足，主要是依赖记忆而非真正的因果推理能力。此外，现实应用中反事实推理的评估也面临挑战。

Method: 提出Causal Cartographer框架，包括一个图检索增强生成代理用于从数据中提取因果关系，以及一个受因果关系约束的反事实推理代理。

Result: 该方法能够有效提取因果知识，提升LLM在因果推理任务中的鲁棒性，同时降低推理成本并减少虚假相关性。

Conclusion: Causal Cartographer框架通过显式建模因果关系，显著提升了模型在复杂因果推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Causal world models are systems that can answer counterfactual questions
about an environment of interest, i.e. predict how it would have evolved if an
arbitrary subset of events had been realized differently. It requires
understanding the underlying causes behind chains of events and conducting
causal inference for arbitrary unseen distributions. So far, this task eludes
foundation models, notably large language models (LLMs), which do not have
demonstrated causal reasoning capabilities beyond the memorization of existing
causal relationships. Furthermore, evaluating counterfactuals in real-world
applications is challenging since only the factual world is observed, limiting
evaluation to synthetic datasets. We address these problems by explicitly
extracting and modeling causal relationships and propose the Causal
Cartographer framework. First, we introduce a graph retrieval-augmented
generation agent tasked to retrieve causal relationships from data. This
approach allows us to construct a large network of real-world causal
relationships that can serve as a repository of causal knowledge and build
real-world counterfactuals. In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning
agent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step
causal inference. We show that our approach can extract causal knowledge and
improve the robustness of LLMs for causal reasoning tasks while reducing
inference costs and spurious correlations.

Result: 在同一训练数据下，BCPG-NSA在数学/代码推理任务中表现优于基线，提高了样本效率并展现出扩展性。

Conclusion: BCPG-NSA证明了负面样本中有效信息的挖掘对提升模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning language models have witnessed a paradigm shift
from short to long CoT pattern. Given the substantial computational cost of
rollouts in long CoT models, maximizing the utility of fixed training datasets
becomes crucial. Our analysis reveals that negative responses contain valuable
components such as self-reflection and error-correction steps, yet primary
existing methods either completely discard negative samples (RFT) or apply
equal penalization across all tokens (RL), failing to leverage these potential
learning signals. In light of this, we propose Behavior Constrained Policy
Gradient with Negative Sample Augmentation (BCPG-NSA), a fine-grained offline
RL framework that encompasses three stages: 1) sample segmentation, 2)
consensus-based step correctness assessment combining LLM and PRM judgers, and
3) policy optimization with NSA designed to effectively mine positive steps
within negative samples. Experimental results show that BCPG-NSA outperforms
baselines on several challenging math/coding reasoning benchmarks using the
same training dataset, achieving improved sample efficiency and demonstrating
robustness and scalability when extended to multiple iterations.

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a central challenge in fully harnessing
the capabilities of LLMs. While well-designed prompts can dramatically enhance
performance, crafting them typically demands expert intuition and a nuanced
understanding of the task. Moreover, the most impactful prompts often hinge on
subtle semantic cues, ones that may elude human perception but are crucial for
guiding LLM behavior. In this paper, we introduce PRL (Prompts from

generation. Unlike previous methods, PRL can produce novel few-shot examples
that were not seen during training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a range of benchmarks, including text classification,
simplification, and summarization. On the classification task, it surpasses
prior methods by 2.58% over APE and 1.00% over EvoPrompt. Additionally, it

Method: 提出SCOPE方法，将自然语言推理步骤转化为代码，并通过抽象语法树归一化，合并等效步骤构建前缀树。

Result: SCOPE将复杂度从$O(NMK)$降至$O(N)$，并用仅5%的计算资源构建了包含196K样本的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 在PRMs训练中，SCOPE显著优于现有自动注释方法，尤其是在Best-of-N策略和ProcessBench上表现突出。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated promising results in
mathematical reasoning, but existing process annotation approaches, whether
through human annotations or Monte Carlo simulations, remain computationally
expensive. In this paper, we introduce Step COmpression for Process Estimation
(SCOPE), a novel compression-based approach that significantly reduces
annotation costs. We first translate natural language reasoning steps into code
and normalize them through Abstract Syntax Tree, then merge equivalent steps to
construct a prefix tree. Unlike simulation-based methods that waste numerous
samples on estimation, SCOPE leverages a compression-based prefix tree where
each root-to-leaf path serves as a training sample, reducing the complexity
from $O(NMK)$ to $O(N)$. We construct a large-scale dataset containing 196K
samples with only 5% of the computational resources required by previous
methods. Empirical results demonstrate that PRMs trained on our dataset
consistently outperform existing automated annotation approaches on both
Best-of-N strategy and ProcessBench.

TL;DR: 结合神经符号方法，通过类比问题检索和形式验证器提升LLM在几何问题中的证明生成能力，显著提高准确率。

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在需要严格逻辑推理和符号推理的正式领域（如数学证明生成）中的局限性。

Method: 两阶段方法：(1) 检索类似问题并用其证明指导LLM；(2) 使用形式验证器评估和反馈生成的证明。

Result: 显著提高了OpenAI o1模型的证明准确率（58%-70%提升）。

Conclusion: 生成可证明正确结论的LLM可大幅提升可靠性、准确性和一致性，适用于需要高信任度的复杂任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require
rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof
generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative
strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a
proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1)
we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a
formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping
the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both
analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More
broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could
dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking
complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require
trustworthiness.

TL;DR: 研究显示，进行链式思维（CoT）推理的大语言模型（LLMs）在问题解决和信心表达上优于非推理模型，且信心校准表现更优。

Motivation: LLMs在表达自身信心时往往不准确，限制了其可靠性。本研究探讨推理模型能否更准确地表达信心。

Method: 对六种推理模型在六个数据集上进行基准测试，分析其慢思考行为（如探索替代方法和回溯）对信心校准的影响。

Result: 推理模型在33/36设置中表现优于非推理模型，信心校准随时间推移而提升；移除慢思考行为会导致校准显著下降。

Conclusion: 慢思考行为是推理模型信心校准的关键，非推理模型通过上下文学习也能受益。

Abstract: Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to
communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when
they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we
demonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but
also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six
reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better
confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the
36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem
from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring
alternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their
confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more
accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly
better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning
models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a
significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not
exclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to
perform slow thinking via in-context learning.

TL;DR: BACON是一个基于分级逻辑的新型框架，用于自动训练可解释的AI模型，旨在实现高预测精度和完全透明的决策逻辑。

Motivation: 随着机器学习和自主代理在高风险领域（如医疗、金融等）的广泛应用，对透明和可信赖的解释的需求日益迫切。

Method: BACON使用分级逻辑自动训练可解释的AI模型，提供结构透明和基于逻辑的符号化解释。

Result: 在多个场景（如布尔近似、鸢尾花分类等）中，BACON不仅实现了高性能，还生成了紧凑且可验证的决策逻辑。

Conclusion: BACON是一个实用且原则性的方法，能够提供清晰、可信赖的可解释AI。

Abstract: As machine learning models and autonomous agents are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes, real-world domains such as healthcare, security, finance, and
robotics, the need for transparent and trustworthy explanations has become
critical. To ensure end-to-end transparency of AI decisions, we need models
that are not only accurate but also fully explainable and human-tunable. We
introduce BACON, a novel framework for automatically training explainable AI
models for decision making problems using graded logic. BACON achieves high
predictive accuracy while offering full structural transparency and precise,
logic-based symbolic explanations, enabling effective human-AI collaboration
and expert-guided refinement. We evaluate BACON with a diverse set of
scenarios: classic Boolean approximation, Iris flower classification, house
purchasing decisions and breast cancer diagnosis. In each case, BACON provides
high-performance models while producing compact, human-verifiable decision
logic. These results demonstrate BACON's potential as a practical and
principled approach for delivering crisp, trustworthy explainable AI.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个‘保护式查询路由’问题，提出GQR-Bench基准测试，并对比了多种路由方法的性能。结果显示，结合离域检测的WideMLP在准确性和速度上表现最佳。

Motivation: 在查询路由任务中，如何处理分布外查询（如无关领域问题、其他语言或不安全文本）是一个重要问题。本文旨在研究和评估不同方法在此任务中的表现。

Method: 引入GQR-Bench基准测试，覆盖三个目标领域和七种数据集，评估了LLM、传统机器学习模型和词袋分类器在查询路由任务中的性能。

Result: WideMLP在准确率（88%）和速度（<4ms）上表现最佳；fastText速度最快（<1ms）；LLM准确率最高（91%）但速度较慢。

Conclusion: 质疑了LLM在查询路由中的自动依赖，推荐在实际应用中采用WideMLP或fastText等高效方法。

Abstract: Query routing, the task to route user queries to different large language
model (LLM) endpoints, can be considered as a text classification problem.
However, out-of-distribution queries must be handled properly, as those could
be questions about unrelated domains, queries in other languages, or even
contain unsafe text. Here, we thus study a \emph{guarded} query routing
problem, for which we first introduce the Guarded Query Routing Benchmark
(GQR-Bench), which covers three exemplary target domains (law, finance, and
healthcare), and seven datasets to test robustness against out-of-distribution
queries. We then use GQR-Bench to contrast the effectiveness and efficiency of
LLM-based routing mechanisms (GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.2-3B, and Llama-3.1-8B),
standard LLM-based guardrail approaches (LlamaGuard and NVIDIA NeMo
Guardrails), continuous bag-of-words classifiers (WideMLP, fastText), and
traditional machine learning models (SVM, XGBoost). Our results show that
WideMLP, enhanced with out-of-domain detection capabilities, yields the best
trade-off between accuracy (88\%) and speed (<4ms). The embedding-based
fastText excels at speed (<1ms) with acceptable accuracy (80\%), whereas LLMs
yield the highest accuracy (91\%) but are comparatively slow (62ms for local
Llama-3.1:8B and 669ms for remote GPT-4o-mini calls). Our findings challenge
the automatic reliance on LLMs for (guarded) query routing and provide concrete
recommendations for practical applications. GQR-Bench will be released as a
Python package -- \texttt{gqr}.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的注意力逻辑模型，解决了现有动态认知逻辑无法处理复杂注意力场景的问题，尤其适用于AI代理分析人类注意力偏见的场景。

Motivation: 现有动态认知逻辑仅能处理原子公式的注意力模型，且复杂度随代理和变量数量指数增长，无法应对复杂注意力场景如高阶信念或多代理注意力。

Method: 通过扩展边条件事件模型，使其表达力与标准事件模型相当但更简洁；将注意力扩展到任意公式，支持代理间注意力交互。

Result: 新逻辑模型在表达力和复杂度上取得平衡，支持复杂注意力场景建模，并成功应用于AI代理发现人类注意力偏见。

Conclusion: 该逻辑模型为注意力提供了一种模态化处理方式，填补了现有工具的空白，具有理论和应用双重价值。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first general logic of attention. Attention is a
powerful cognitive ability that allows agents to focus on potentially complex
information, such as logically structured propositions, higher-order beliefs,
or what other agents pay attention to. This ability is a strength, as it helps
to ignore what is irrelevant, but it can also introduce biases when some types
of information or agents are systematically ignored. Existing dynamic epistemic
logics for attention cannot model such complex attention scenarios, as they
only model attention to atomic formulas. Additionally, such logics quickly
become cumbersome, as their size grows exponentially in the number of agents
and announced literals. Here, we introduce a logic that overcomes both
limitations. First, we generalize edge-conditioned event models, which we show
to be as expressive as standard event models yet exponentially more succinct
(generalizing both standard event models and generalized arrow updates).
Second, we extend attention to arbitrary formulas, allowing agents to also
attend to other agents' beliefs or attention. Our work treats attention as a
modality, like belief or awareness. We introduce attention principles that
impose closure properties on that modality and that can be used in its
axiomatization. Throughout, we illustrate our framework with examples of AI
agents reasoning about human attentional biases, demonstrating how such agents
can discover attentional biases.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了多智能体强化学习在优化交通信号协调中的应用，显示其相比于固定时间信号控制系统能显著减少等待时间和提高交通流量。

Motivation: 城市交通拥堵在十字路口尤为严重，固定时间信号控制系统难以应对动态交通模式，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 通过模拟环境（Pygame）建模多个十字路口，实现分散式多智能体强化学习控制器，每个交通信号作为自主智能体基于局部观察和邻域信息决策。

Result: 与固定时间控制器相比，MARL显著减少了平均等待时间并提高了整体交通流量。

Conclusion: MARL动态控制策略在提升城市交通效率方面具有潜力，但需进一步研究可扩展性和实际应用挑战。

Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly
impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time
signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic
patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across
multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a
simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections
with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability.
A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal
operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations
and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a
baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time
and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically
significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved
throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies
hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency.
More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world
implementation challenges.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了Agent Context Protocols（ACPs），一种用于多智能体系统的结构化协议，通过结合执行蓝图和标准化消息模式，提升协作性能，并在实验中达到领先水平。

Motivation: 当前多智能体系统的协调依赖非结构化的自然语言，限制了复杂交互和领域专用智能体的互操作性。

Method: 提出ACPs协议，结合持久执行蓝图和标准化消息模式，实现多智能体的高效协作与容错。

Result: ACP系统在AssistantBench上的长时网络辅助任务中达到28.3%准确率，在多模态技术报告中表现优于商业AI系统。

Conclusion: ACPs具有高度模块化和可扩展性，可快速构建高性能通用智能体。

Abstract: AI agents have become increasingly adept at complex tasks such as coding,
reasoning, and multimodal understanding. However, building generalist systems
requires moving beyond individual agents to collective inference -- a paradigm
where multi-agent systems with diverse, task-specialized agents complement one
another through structured communication and collaboration. Today, coordination
is usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits
complex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents.
We introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic
family of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and
error handling. ACPs combine (i) persistent execution blueprints -- explicit
dependency graphs that store intermediate agent outputs -- with (ii)
standardized message schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent
collective inference. ACP-powered generalist systems reach state-of-the-art
performance: 28.3 % accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance
and best-in-class multimodal technical reports, outperforming commercial AI
systems in human evaluation. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, allowing
practitioners to build top-tier generalist agents quickly.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated unprecedented performance
across various domains, and its application to communication systems is an
active area of research. While current methods focus on task-specific
solutions, the broader trend in AI is shifting toward large general models
capable of supporting multiple applications. In this work, we take a step
toward a foundation model for communication data--a transformer-based,
multi-modal model designed to operate directly on communication data. We
propose methodologies to address key challenges, including tokenization,
positional embedding, multimodality, variable feature sizes, and normalization.
Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that such a model can successfully
estimate multiple features, including transmission rank, selected precoder,
Doppler spread, and delay profile.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Self-Braking Tuning (SBT)的新框架，旨在通过模型自我调节来解决大型推理模型（LRMs）中的冗余推理问题，减少计算开销。

Motivation: 大型推理模型在生成长链思维时出现大量冗余推理，导致计算成本高昂和过度思考问题，现有方法依赖外部干预，效果有限。

Method: 提出SBT框架，设计过思考识别指标，构建自适应推理长度数据，引入刹车提示机制，使模型学会自我终止推理。

Result: 实验表明，SBT在数学基准测试中减少了60%的token消耗，同时保持与未约束模型相当的准确性。

Conclusion: SBT框架有效解决了冗余推理问题，提供了一种无需外部干预的自我调节方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities by generating longer chains
of thought, demonstrating outstanding performance across a variety of tasks.
However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in
redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high
computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although
numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they
often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the
perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus
eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of
overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a
systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately
identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates
training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this
foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive
reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that
enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an
appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC,
MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to
60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在逻辑搜索推理中的能力，填补现有研究专注于推理规则的不足。

Method: 通过自动生成SAT公式并将其转化为故事上下文和条件，构建2100个可调整难度的逻辑谜题，并通过多重验证确保质量。

Result: 最强模型o4-mini在难题上准确率仅65.0%，接近50%的随机基线。

Conclusion: SATBench揭示了当前大语言模型在搜索型逻辑推理中的根本局限性，为未来研究提供可扩展测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived
from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on
inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from
a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT
problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified
set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT
formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The
generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by
varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both
LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a
subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini,
achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random
baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based
logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for
future research in logical reasoning.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）在多样领域和多模态中展现出超越人类评估者的能力，如何实现可扩展的监管成为挑战，辩论机制为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 研究在多模态背景下采用辩论机制，由两个视觉语言专家模型进行辩论，文本模型作为裁判裁决答案。专家仅支持符合其信念的答案，避免角色扮演，集中讨论分歧点。

Conclusion: 辩论机制在多模态监督中具有潜力，能够有效提升模型性能，尤其适用于解决模型能力超越人类评估者时的监管问题。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain expertise across diverse domains and
modalities, scalable oversight becomes increasingly challenging, particularly
when their capabilities may surpass human evaluators. Debate has emerged as a
promising mechanism for enabling such oversight. In this work, we extend the
debate paradigm to a multimodal setting, exploring its potential for weaker
models to supervise and enhance the performance of stronger models. We focus on
visual question answering (VQA), where two "sighted" expert vision-language
models debate an answer, while a "blind" (text-only) judge adjudicates based
solely on the quality of the arguments. In our framework, the experts defend
only answers aligned with their beliefs, thereby obviating the need for
explicit role-playing and concentrating the debate on instances of expert
disagreement. Experiments on several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the
debate framework consistently outperforms individual expert models. Moreover,
judgments from weaker LLMs can help instill reasoning capabilities in
vision-language models through finetuning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在开放推理中表现优异，但在成本敏感规划中往往表现不佳，无法有效处理严格的预算约束。

Method: 通过引入成本增强的蒙特卡洛树搜索（CATS），结合LLM的推理能力与结构化搜索，实现了对成本约束的显式关注。

Result: 实验表明，CATS在严格预算下表现优于GPT-4.1等顶级LLMs，任务成功率和成本效率更高。

Conclusion: CATS为预算敏感的决策提供了一种有效的解决方案，结合了LLMs的推理能力与结构化搜索的优势。

Abstract: While LLMs excel at open-ended reasoning, they often struggle with
cost-sensitive planning, either treating all actions as having equal cost or
failing to stay within strict budgets. In this paper, we introduce
Cost-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (CATS), a novel approach that brings
explicit cost-awareness into LLM-guided planning. Tight cost constraints push
the planner to quickly identify infeasible solutions, while looser constraints
encourage optimization for minimal cost. We benchmark top LLMs such as GPT-4.1,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1, against our CATS planner to evaluate their
performance in cost-sensitive scenarios. Our experiments suggest that raw LLMs
such as GPT-4.1 often falter under tight budgets, whereas CATS consistently
delivers strong performance, achieving higher task success rates and better
cost efficiency. CATS provides an effective solution for budget-aware
decision-making by combining the reasoning power of LLMs with structured
search.

TL;DR: SAFEPATH是一种轻量级对齐方法，通过在推理开始时生成安全提示来减少有害输出，同时保持推理性能。

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂问题解决中表现强大，但其结构化推理路径在面对有害提示时可能导致不安全输出，现有安全对齐方法存在性能下降和攻击漏洞问题。

Method: SAFEPATH通过微调LRMs，使其在面对有害提示时生成简短的安全提示（8个token），其余推理过程不受监督。

Result: SAFEPATH在多个基准测试中显著减少有害输出（最多90.0%），并阻止83.3%的越狱攻击，计算成本远低于其他方法。

Conclusion: SAFEPATH是一种高效的安全对齐方法，同时揭示了当前方法在推理模型中的不足，为更安全的AI提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem
solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs
when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce
harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant
trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated
jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight
alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at
the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the
rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while
maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful
responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than
Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot
variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to
reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer
AI.

Result: 在ContextAgentBench上，ContextAgent在主动预测和工具调用上的准确率分别提高了8.5%和6.0%。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更先进、以人为中心的主动AI助手提供了启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent
agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing
proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed
environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based
proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and
limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce
ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates
extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents.
ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory
perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions.
ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from
historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive
assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary
tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate
ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive
LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty
tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为RICE的新方法，通过强化认知专家提升大型推理模型的性能，无需额外训练或复杂启发式。

Motivation: 现有的推理模型常因认知效率问题（如过度思考或思考不足）表现不佳，RICE旨在解决这一局限。

Method: 利用nPMI识别并强化特定的认知专家，优化推理过程。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3-235B等模型上，RICE显著提升了准确性、认知效率和跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: RICE是一种轻量且可解释的方法，能有效提升高级推理模型的认知效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)
have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating
experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances,
existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like
overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts
(RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training
or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information
(nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive
experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by
tokens like ''<think>''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs
(DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning
accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our
lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering
techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving
the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight
reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable
direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.

TL;DR: 为了解决非专家用户和专家用户在SPARQL查询构建上的困难，Q²Forge工具通过迭代验证和人类反馈生成新能力问题和SPARQL查询。

Motivation: SPARQL查询是访问知识图谱的标准方法，但构建这些查询对非专家用户和专家用户来说都很耗时。现有的能力问题和查询示例往往不足，需要一种自动生成高质量查询的方法。

Method: 使用Q²Forge工具，通过迭代验证和人类反馈生成新能力问题和SPARQL查询。工具是开源的、通用的、可扩展的和模块化的。

Result: Q²Forge提供了一个完整的流程，从能力问题生成到查询评估，支持为任何目标知识图谱创建参考查询集。

Conclusion: Q²Forge通过结合人类反馈和LLM验证，有效解决了生成高质量SPARQL查询的挑战。

Abstract: The SPARQL query language is the standard method to access knowledge graphs
(KGs). However, formulating SPARQL queries is a significant challenge for
non-expert users, and remains time-consuming for the experienced ones. Best
practices recommend to document KGs with competency questions and example
queries to contextualise the knowledge they contain and illustrate their
potential applications. In practice, however, this is either not the case or
the examples are provided in limited numbers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are
being used in conversational agents and are proving to be an attractive
solution with a wide range of applications, from simple question-answering
about common knowledge to generating code in a targeted programming language.
However, training and testing these models to produce high quality SPARQL
queries from natural language questions requires substantial datasets of
question-query pairs. In this paper, we present Q${}^2$Forge that addresses the
challenge of generating new competency questions for a KG and corresponding
SPARQL queries. It iteratively validates those queries with human feedback and
LLM as a judge. Q${}^2$Forge is open source, generic, extensible and modular,
meaning that the different modules of the application (CQ generation, query
generation and query refinement) can be used separately, as an integrated
pipeline, or replaced by alternative services. The result is a complete
pipeline from competency question formulation to query evaluation, supporting
the creation of reference query sets for any target KG.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Abacus，一种用于优化语义操作符系统的成本优化器，通过最小验证样本和先验知识提升性能。

Motivation: 现有语义操作符优化器在多维优化（如质量、成本、延迟）方面能力有限，Abacus旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Abacus利用验证样本和先验知识搜索最优实现，支持多目标优化。

Result: 在生物医学、法律领域及多模态问答任务中，Abacus优化系统质量提升18.7%-39.2%，成本降低23.6倍，延迟减少4.2倍。

Conclusion: Abacus显著提升了语义操作符系统的性能，适用于多维优化场景。

Abstract: LLMs enable an exciting new class of data processing applications over large
collections of unstructured documents. Several new programming frameworks have
enabled developers to build these applications by composing them out of
semantic operators: a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with
natural language specifications. These include LLM-powered maps, filters,
joins, etc. used for document processing tasks such as information extraction,
summarization, and more. While systems of semantic operators have achieved
strong performance on benchmarks, they can be difficult to optimize. An
optimizer for this setting must determine how to physically implement each
semantic operator in a way that optimizes the system globally. Existing
optimizers are limited in the number of optimizations they can apply, and most
(if not all) cannot optimize system quality, cost, or latency subject to
constraint(s) on the other dimensions. In this paper we present Abacus, an
extensible, cost-based optimizer which searches for the best implementation of
a semantic operator system given a (possibly constrained) optimization
objective. Abacus estimates operator performance by leveraging a minimal set of
validation examples and, if available, prior beliefs about operator
performance. We evaluate Abacus on document processing workloads in the
biomedical and legal domains (BioDEX; CUAD) and multi-modal question answering
(MMQA). We demonstrate that systems optimized by Abacus achieve 18.7%-39.2%
better quality and up to 23.6x lower cost and 4.2x lower latency than the next
best system.

Motivation: 尽管PFNs在表格数据预测中表现出色，但缺乏对预测均值、分位数等的不确定性量化。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于Martingale posteriors的采样方法，构建贝叶斯后验分布，并证明其收敛性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据实验中，该方法成功量化了预测的不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为PFNs提供了有效的预测不确定性量化工具，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have emerged as promising foundation models
for prediction from tabular data sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance
on small to moderate data sizes without tuning. While PFNs are motivated by
Bayesian ideas, they do not provide any uncertainty quantification for
predictive means, quantiles, or similar quantities. We propose a principled and
efficient sampling procedure to construct Bayesian posteriors for such
estimates based on Martingale posteriors, and prove its convergence. Several
simulated and real-world data examples showcase the uncertainty quantification
of our method in inference applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的基于FDK算法的神经网络方法，通过选择性集成可训练元素和利用小波变换减少参数空间，从而在保持可解释性的同时提升图像质量和计算效率。

Motivation: 传统FDK算法在CBCT重建中存在噪声和伪影问题，而现有深度学习方法虽改进图像质量，但计算复杂且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 在FDK算法的余弦加权和滤波阶段选择性引入可训练元素，并利用小波变换稀疏化表示以减少参数。

Result: 参数数量减少93.75%，计算效率提高，图像质量提升且保持与传统FDK相当的推理成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床应用中具有实用价值，尤其在计算资源有限的环境中。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is essential in medical imaging, and the
Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is a popular choice for reconstruction due
to its efficiency. However, FDK is susceptible to noise and artifacts. While
recent deep learning methods offer improved image quality, they often increase
computational complexity and lack the interpretability of traditional methods.
In this paper, we introduce an enhanced FDK-based neural network that maintains
the classical algorithm's interpretability by selectively integrating trainable
elements into the cosine weighting and filtering stages. Recognizing the
challenge of a large parameter space inherent in 3D CBCT data, we leverage
wavelet transformations to create sparse representations of the cosine weights
and filters. This strategic sparsification reduces the parameter count by
$93.75\%$ without compromising performance, accelerates convergence, and
importantly, maintains the inference computational cost equivalent to the
classical FDK algorithm. Our method not only ensures volumetric consistency and
boosts robustness to noise, but is also designed for straightforward
integration into existing CT reconstruction pipelines. This presents a
pragmatic enhancement that can benefit clinical applications, particularly in
environments with computational limitations.

Abstract: A common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease requires a precise
diagnosis and efficient treatment, particularly in light of escalating
healthcare expenses and the expanding use of artificial intelligence in medical
diagnostics. Many recent studies shows that the combination of brain Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) and deep neural networks have achieved promising
results for diagnosing AD. Using deep convolutional neural networks, this paper
introduces a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates multiresidual
blocks, specialized spatial attention blocks, grouped query attention, and
multi-head attention. The study assessed the model's performance on four
publicly accessible datasets and concentrated on identifying binary and
multiclass issues across various categories. This paper also takes into account
of the explainability of AD's progression and compared with state-of-the-art
methods namely Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), Score-CAM, Faster
Score-CAM, and XGRADCAM. Our methodology consistently outperforms current
approaches, achieving 99.66\% accuracy in 4-class classification, 99.63\% in
3-class classification, and 100\% in binary classification using Kaggle
datasets. For Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets the
accuracies are 99.92\%, 99.90\%, and 99.95\% respectively. The Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) dataset was used for experiments in
three planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) and a combination of all planes.
The study achieved accuracies of 99.08\% for axis, 99.85\% for sagittal, 99.5\%
for coronal, and 99.17\% for all axis, and 97.79\% and 8.60\% respectively for
ADNI-2. The network's ability to retrieve important information from MRI images
is demonstrated by its excellent accuracy in categorizing AD stages.

Motivation: 肺段分割对癌症定位和手术规划至关重要，但像素级标注耗时且边界难以区分，因此提出一种基于解剖学定义的弱监督方法。

Method: 设计了基于段级和叶级监督的损失函数，引入两阶段分割策略，并使用一致性损失优化边界平滑性。

Result: 在私有数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效提升分割效果和边界平滑性。

Conclusion: AHSL方法通过结合解剖学定义和多级监督，显著提高了肺段分割的精度和实用性。

Abstract: Pulmonary segment segmentation is crucial for cancer localization and
surgical planning. However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is
laborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical
images. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method,
termed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise
clinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary
segment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are
determined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the
design of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level
labels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments,
ensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree.
Second, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment,
ensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a
two-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori
information. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the
smoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to
measure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries. Visual inspection and
evaluation metrics from experiments conducted on a private dataset demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 为了解决模型在临床环境中对罕见或未知病症的识别能力不足的问题，作者提出了NOVA基准。

Method: NOVA包含约900个脑部MRI扫描，涵盖281种罕见病理和多种采集协议，每个案例附带临床叙述和专家标注。

Result: 基线测试显示，领先的视觉语言模型在NOVA上的表现显著下降。

Conclusion: NOVA为提升模型对未知异常的检测、定位和推理能力提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ
from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies
whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world
recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as
ever-emerging, previously $unknown$ categories appear and must be addressed
without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on
large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across
domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test
sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation
back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel
conditions encountered in clinical use.
  We therefore present $NOVA$, a challenging, real-life $evaluation-only$
benchmark of $\sim$900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and
heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical
narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these
enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and
diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an
$extreme$ stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge
a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline
results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks,
establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect,
localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.

Abstract: The International Society of Ultrasound advocates Intrapartum Ultrasound (US)
Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) to monitor labour progression
through changes in fetal head position. Two reliable ultrasound-derived
parameters that are used to predict outcomes of instrumental vaginal delivery
are the angle of progression (AoP) and head-symphysis distance (HSD). In this
work, as part of the Intrapartum Ultrasounds Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024, we
propose an automated fetal biometry measurement pipeline to reduce intra- and
inter-observer variability and improve measurement reliability. Our pipeline
consists of three key tasks: (i) classification of standard planes (SP) from US
videos, (ii) segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from the detected
SPs, and (iii) computation of the AoP and HSD from the segmented regions. We
perform sparse sampling to mitigate class imbalances and reduce spurious
correlations in task (i), and utilize ensemble-based deep learning methods for
task (i) and (ii) to enhance generalizability under different US acquisition
settings. Finally, to promote robustness in task iii) with respect to the
structural fidelity of measurements, we retain the largest connected components
and apply ellipse fitting to the segmentations. Our solution achieved ACC:
0.9452, F1: 0.9225, AUC: 0.983, MCC: 0.8361, DSC: 0.918, HD: 19.73, ASD: 5.71,
$\Delta_{AoP}$: 8.90 and $\Delta_{HSD}$: 14.35 across an unseen hold-out set of
4 patients and 224 US frames. The results from the proposed automated pipeline
can improve the understanding of labour arrest causes and guide the development
of clinical risk stratification tools for efficient and effective prenatal

Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML)
have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum
machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex
challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires
expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption
of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding
strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the
performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often
neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that
may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We
propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum
system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an
end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous
optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized
observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum
observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network,
allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream.
Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum
circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably,
it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification
accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML
models.

Conclusion: 数据编码方法的选择对QML性能至关重要，但缺乏通用选择规则，需要根据具体数据集进行实验验证。

Abstract: Data encoding plays a fundamental and distinctive role in Quantum Machine
Learning (QML). While classical approaches process data directly as vectors,
QML may require transforming classical data into quantum states through
encoding circuits, known as quantum feature maps or quantum embeddings. This
step leverages the inherently high-dimensional and non-linear nature of Hilbert
space, enabling more efficient data separation in complex feature spaces that
may be inaccessible to classical methods. This encoding part significantly
affects the performance of the QML model, so it is important to choose the
right encoding method for the dataset to be encoded. However, this choice is
generally arbitrary, since there is no "universal" rule for knowing which
encoding to choose based on a specific set of data. There are currently a
variety of encoding methods using different quantum logic gates. We studied the
most commonly used types of encoding methods and benchmarked them using
different datasets.

Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) system enables direct communication between
the brain and external devices, offering significant potential for assistive
technologies and advanced human-computer interaction. Despite progress, BCI
systems face persistent challenges, including signal variability,
classification inefficiency, and difficulty adapting to individual users in
real time. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum learning model,
termed QSVM-QNN, which integrates a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with
a Quantum Neural Network (QNN), to improve classification accuracy and
robustness in EEG-based BCI tasks. Unlike existing models, QSVM-QNN combines
the decision boundary capabilities of QSVM with the expressive learning power
of QNN, leading to superior generalization performance. The proposed model is
evaluated on two benchmark EEG datasets, achieving high accuracies of 0.990 and
0.950, outperforming both classical and standalone quantum models. To
demonstrate real-world viability, we further validated the robustness of QNN,
QSVM, and QSVM-QNN against six realistic quantum noise models, including bit
flip and phase damping. These experiments reveal that QSVM-QNN maintains stable
performance under noisy conditions, establishing its applicability for
deployment in practical, noisy quantum environments. Beyond BCI, the proposed
hybrid quantum architecture is generalizable to other biomedical and
time-series classification tasks, offering a scalable and noise-resilient
solution for next-generation neurotechnological systems.

Abstract: With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have
emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their
computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection
between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly
within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of
innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm,
Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle
points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in
complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges,
including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and
limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of
quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on
function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by
insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the
acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD
by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based
QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases
the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on
challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms
existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.

Result: Pel通过高级功能（如管道机制、闭包支持及自然语言条件）实现了更稳健和安全的LLM编排。

Conclusion: Pel为LLM编排提供了更强大且可靠的新范式，推动AI框架的进一步发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in
computing, yet controlling and orchestrating their capabilities beyond simple
text generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as function/tool
calling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness,
scalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control.
This paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed
to bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and
Haskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich
platform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent
communication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily
modifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the
need for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level.
Key features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition,
first-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns,
built-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an
advanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and
LLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel
incorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static
dependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems. We argue that Pel
offers a more robust, secure, and expressive paradigm for LLM orchestration,
paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI agentic frameworks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了RTL++方法，利用图表示增强LLM在RTL代码生成中的性能。

Motivation: 传统RTL设计方法繁琐且易错，商用LLMs存在安全隐私问题，而开源LLMs因数据质量不足表现不佳。

Method: 通过将RTL代码编码为控制流图和数据流图的文本形式，增强LLM对代码结构的理解。

Result: RTL++在VerilogEval基准测试中优于当前最优模型，证明图增强背景的有效性。

Conclusion: RTL++通过图表示提升了LLM辅助RTL代码生成的质量和能力。

Abstract: As hardware design complexity escalates, there is an urgent need for advanced
automation in electronic design automation (EDA). Traditional register transfer
level (RTL) design methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.
While commercial (instruction-tuned) large language models (LLMs) shows
promising performance for automation, they pose security and privacy concerns.
Open-source models offer alternatives; however, they frequently fall short in
quality/correctness, largely due to limited, high-quality RTL code data
essential for effective training and generalization. This paper proposes RTL++,
a first-of-its-kind LLM-assisted method for RTL code generation that utilizes
graph representations of code structures to enhance the quality of generated
code. By encoding RTL code into a textualized control flowgraphs (CFG) and data
flow graphs (DFG), RTL++ captures the inherent hierarchy, dependencies, and
relationships within the code. This structured graph-based approach enhances
the context available to LLMs, enabling them to better understand and generate
instructions. By focusing on data generation through graph representations,
RTL++ addresses the limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on code
and suffer from lack of diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that RTL++
outperforms state-of-the-art models fine-tuned for RTL generation, as evaluated
using the VerilogEval benchmark's Pass@1/5/10 metric, as well as the RTLLM1.1
model, which highlight the effectiveness of graph-enhanced context in advancing
the capabilities of LLM-assisted RTL code generation.

Result: 总结了当前重采样技术的最新进展及其实际应用效果。

Conclusion: 提出了未来在不平衡数据领域的潜在研究方向。

Abstract: Imbalanced data poses a significant obstacle in machine learning, as an
unequal distribution of class labels often results in skewed predictions and
diminished model accuracy. To mitigate this problem, various resampling
strategies have been developed, encompassing both oversampling and
undersampling techniques aimed at modifying class proportions. Conventional
oversampling approaches like SMOTE enhance the representation of the minority
class, whereas undersampling methods focus on trimming down the majority class.
Advances in deep learning have facilitated the creation of more complex
solutions, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), which are capable of producing high-quality synthetic
examples. This paper reviews a broad spectrum of data balancing methods,
classifying them into categories including synthetic oversampling, adaptive
techniques, generative models, ensemble-based strategies, hybrid approaches,
undersampling, and neighbor-based methods. Furthermore, it highlights current
developments in resampling techniques and discusses practical implementations
and case studies that validate their effectiveness. The paper concludes by
offering perspectives on potential directions for future exploration in this
domain.

Conclusion: 连续域泛化任务及其提出的方法在多维连续域变化中表现出更强的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data distributions often shift continuously across multiple latent
factors such as time, geography, and socioeconomic context. However, existing
domain generalization approaches typically treat domains as discrete or
evolving along a single axis (e.g., time), which fails to capture the complex,
multi-dimensional nature of real-world variation. This paper introduces the
task of Continuous Domain Generalization (CDG), which aims to generalize
predictive models to unseen domains defined by arbitrary combinations of
continuous variation descriptors. We present a principled framework grounded in
geometric and algebraic theory, showing that optimal model parameters across
domains lie on a low-dimensional manifold. To model this structure, we propose
a Neural Lie Transport Operator (NeuralLTO), which enables structured parameter
transitions by enforcing geometric continuity and algebraic consistency. To
handle noisy or incomplete domain descriptors, we introduce a gating mechanism
to suppress irrelevant dimensions and a local chart-based strategy for robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets-including remote sensing, scientific documents, and traffic
forecasting-demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
baselines in generalization accuracy and robustness under descriptor
imperfections.

Conclusion: 进化Bandit学习在游戏理论中具有潜力，尤其是通过进化算法实现的随机乐观策略。

Abstract: Learning in games is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, with numerous
applications~\citep{silver2016mastering,schrittwieser2020mastering}. This work
investigates two-player zero-sum matrix games with an unknown payoff matrix and
bandit feedback, where each player observes their actions and the corresponding
noisy payoff. Prior studies have proposed algorithms for this
setting~\citep{o2021matrix,maiti2023query,cai2024uncoupled}, with
\citet{o2021matrix} demonstrating the effectiveness of deterministic optimism
(e.g., \ucb) in achieving sublinear regret. However, the potential of
randomised optimism in matrix games remains theoretically unexplored.
  We propose Competitive Co-evolutionary Bandit Learning (\coebl), a novel
algorithm that integrates evolutionary algorithms (EAs) into the bandit
framework to implement randomised optimism through EA variation operators. We
prove that \coebl achieves sublinear regret, matching the performance of
deterministic optimism-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first theoretical regret analysis of an evolutionary bandit learning algorithm
in matrix games.
  Empirical evaluations on diverse matrix game benchmarks demonstrate that
\coebl not only achieves sublinear regret but also consistently outperforms
classical bandit algorithms, including \exptr~\citep{auer2002nonstochastic},
the variant \exptrni~\citep{cai2024uncoupled}, and \ucb~\citep{o2021matrix}.
These results highlight the potential of evolutionary bandit learning,
particularly the efficacy of randomised optimism via evolutionary algorithms in
game-theoretic settings.

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR和IMDb等数据集上验证了方法的有效性，UQ表现优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 通过锚定点估计，SBMC在保持高效性能的同时，显著提升了不确定量化能力。

Abstract: This work introduces a new method called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo
(SBMC). The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior, and
the algorithm is a parallel implementation of a consistent (asymptotically
unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithm: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method is motivated theoretically, and its
utility is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic
numerical study reveals that parallel implementations of SMC and MCMC are
comparable to serial implementations in terms of performance and total cost,
and they achieve accuracy at or beyond the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like
deep ensembles at convergence, along with substantially improved uncertainty
quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. But even parallel
implementations are expensive, with an irreducible time barrier much larger
than the cost of the MAP estimator. Compressing time further leads to rapid
degradation of accuracy, whereas UQ remains valuable. By anchoring to a point
estimator we can recover accuracy, while retaining valuable UQ, ultimately
delivering strong performance across metrics for a cost comparable to the SOTA.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为‘后向共形预测’的新方法，通过对预测集大小进行灵活控制，保证了共形覆盖的可靠性。与传统方法不同，它通过约束预测集大小的行为来调整覆盖水平。

Motivation: 传统共形预测方法固定覆盖水平但允许预测集大小变动，不适用于要求严格预测集大小的应用（如医学诊断）。因此，需要一种能够灵活控制预测集大小同时保证覆盖可靠性的方法。

Method: 该方法基于两项关键成果：(i) 使用e值确保边际覆盖，并允许数据依赖的覆盖调整；(ii) 提出一种新的留一估计器来计算边际误差，保证理论可行。

Result: 理论和实验证明，该方法能够保持可计算的覆盖保证，同时确保预测集大小可控且易于解释。

Conclusion: 后向共形预测为需要严格控制预测集大小的应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that
guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of
prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage
level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule
that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and
adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key
foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity
using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm
test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 -
\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any
data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out
estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage
$\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the
theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is
particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical
such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical
evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains
computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled
prediction set sizes.

Conclusion: 通过显式建模稀疏图，该模型在捕捉复杂网络结构中表现优异。

Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of
small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub
and dense structures. Based on recent results about graphons on line graphs,
our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs
where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new
condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs.
We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs,
as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph
mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and
social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.

Abstract: In statistical learning, models are classified as regular or singular
depending on whether the mapping from parameters to probability distributions
is injective. Most models with hierarchical structures or latent variables are
singular, for which conventional criteria such as the Akaike Information
Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are inapplicable due to the
breakdown of normal approximations for the likelihood and posterior. To address
this, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely
Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) have been proposed. Since WAIC
and WBIC are computed using posterior distributions at different temperature
settings, separate posterior sampling is generally required. In this paper, we
theoretically derive an asymptotic equation that links WAIC and WBIC, despite
their dependence on different posteriors. This equation yields an
asymptotically unbiased expression of WAIC in terms of the posterior
distribution used for WBIC. The result clarifies the structural relationship
between these criteria within the framework of singular learning theory, and
deepens understanding of their asymptotic behavior. This theoretical
contribution provides a foundation for future developments in the computational
efficiency of model selection in singular models.

Abstract: In recent years, model collapse has become a critical issue in language model
training, making it essential to understand the underlying mechanisms driving
this phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate recursive parametric model
training from a probabilistic perspective, aiming to characterize the
conditions under which model collapse occurs and, crucially, how it can be
mitigated. We conceptualize the recursive training process as a random walk of
the model estimate, highlighting how the sample size influences the step size
and how the estimation procedure determines the direction and potential bias of
the random walk. Under mild conditions, we rigorously show that progressively
increasing the sample size at each training step is necessary to prevent model
collapse. In particular, when the estimation is unbiased, the required growth
rate follows a superlinear pattern. This rate needs to be accelerated even
further in the presence of substantial estimation bias. Building on this
probabilistic framework, we also investigate the probability that recursive
training on synthetic data yields models that outperform those trained solely
on real data. Moreover, we extend these results to general parametric model
family in an asymptotic regime. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through extensive simulations and a real-world dataset.

Abstract: This paper addresses the covariate shift problem in the context of
nonparametric regression within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs).
Covariate shift arises in supervised learning when the input distributions of
the training and test data differ, presenting additional challenges for
learning. Although kernel methods have optimal statistical properties, their
high computational demands in terms of time and, particularly, memory, limit
their scalability to large datasets. To address this limitation, the main focus
of this paper is to explore the trade-off between computational efficiency and
statistical accuracy under covariate shift. We investigate the use of random
projections where the hypothesis space consists of a random subspace within a
given RKHS. Our results show that, even in the presence of covariate shift,
significant computational savings can be achieved without compromising learning
performance.

Abstract: We consider the kernelized contextual bandit problem with a large feature
space. This problem involves $K$ arms, and the goal of the forecaster is to
maximize the cumulative rewards through learning the relationship between the
contexts and the rewards. It serves as a general framework for various
decision-making scenarios, such as personalized online advertising and
recommendation systems. Kernelized contextual bandits generalize the linear
contextual bandit problem and offers a greater modeling flexibility. Existing
methods, when applied to Gaussian kernels, yield a trivial bound of $O(T)$ when
we consider $\Omega(\log T)$ feature dimensions. To address this, we introduce
stochastic assumptions on the context distribution and show that no-regret
learning is achievable even when the number of dimensions grows up to the
number of samples. Furthermore, we analyze lenient regret, which allows a
per-round regret of at most $\Delta > 0$. We derive the rate of lenient regret
in terms of $\Delta$.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了MCTM的透明性和NF的灵活性，适用于复杂多维数据建模。

Abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by
modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible
estimation approaches such as normalizing flows (NF) work particularly well in
multiple dimensions, interpreting the input-output relationship of such models
is often difficult, due to the black-box character of deep learning models. In
contrast, existing statistical methods for multivariate outcomes such as
multivariate conditional transformation models (MCTM) are restricted in
flexibility and are often not expressive enough to represent complex
multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine MCTM with
state-of-the-art and autoregressive NF to leverage the transparency of MCTM for
modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions in the
first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NF techniques to account
for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution. We
demonstrate our method's versatility in various numerical experiments and
compare it with MCTM and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: PSGLA为处理非凸势能提供了一种高效稳定的方法，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex
potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of
the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the
potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse
problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic
Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such
potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA
step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope
allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex
potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in
the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA
exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm
for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.

Conclusion: k-LMVAR是一种高效、通用的向量时间序列聚类方法，适用于复杂系统建模。

Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping
attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system
modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time
series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality
feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly
ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the
system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by
explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first
derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model.
Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then
derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR
(Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable.
We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and
model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and
also scales well computationally.

Abstract: The Determinantal Point Process (DPP) is a parameterized model for
multivariate binary variables, characterized by a correlation kernel matrix.
This paper proposes a closed form estimator of this kernel, which is
particularly easy to implement and can also be used as a starting value of
learning algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We prove the consistency
and asymptotic normality of our estimator, as well as its large deviation
properties.

Abstract: Bootstrap methods have long been a cornerstone of ensemble learning in
machine learning. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of bootstrap
techniques applied to the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) ensemble
in the context of large and growing sample sizes and feature dimensionalities.
Leveraging tools from Random Matrix Theory, we investigate the performance of
this classifier that aggregates decision functions from multiple weak
classifiers, each trained on different subsets of the data. We provide insights
into the use of bootstrap methods in high-dimensional settings, enhancing our
understanding of their impact. Based on these findings, we propose strategies
to select the number of subsets and the regularization parameter that maximize
the performance of the LSSVM. Empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: 介绍了HALO，一种基于分层推理架构的多智能体协作框架，解决了现有智能体系统在复杂环境中适应性不足的问题，并在多项任务上表现优异。

Motivation: 现有智能体系统因预定义的代理角色和静态通信结构在复杂环境中适应性和灵活性不足，影响了专业和专家级任务的性能。

Method: 采用分层推理架构，包括高层规划代理、中层角色设计代理和底层推理代理，并利用蒙特卡洛树搜索和自适应提示优化模块。

Result: 在代码生成、通用推理和算术推理任务上平均提升14.4%，在特定子任务上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: HALO框架显著提升了智能体系统在复杂和专业任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in diverse task scenarios.
Nonetheless, existing agentic systems typically rely on predefined agent-role
design spaces and static communication structures, limiting their adaptability
as well as flexibility in complex interaction environments and leading to
subpar performance on highly specialized and expert-level tasks. To address
these issues, we introduce HALO, a multi-agent collaboration framework based on
a hierarchical reasoning architecture. Specifically, we incorporate a
high-level planning agent for task decomposition, mid-level role-design agents
for subtask-specific agent instantiation, and low-level inference agents for
subtask execution. Particularly, subtask execution is reformulated as a
structured workflow search problem, where Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
systematically explores the agentic action space to construct optimal reasoning
trajectories. Additionally, as the majority of users lack expertise in prompt
engineering, we leverage an Adaptive Prompt Refinement module to transform raw
queries into task-specific prompts. Empirical evaluations on Code Generation
(HumanEval), General Reasoning (MMLU), and Arithmetic Reasoning (MATH)
benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of HALO, yielding a 14.4%
average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, HALO achieves up
to 13.3% performance gain on the Moral Scenarios subject in the MMLU benchmark
and up to 19.6% performance gain on the Algebra subarea in the MATH benchmark,
indicating its advanced proficiency in tackling highly specialized and
expert-level tasks. The code repository is available at

Conclusion: ACPs为构建安全、开放、可扩展的智能体互联网基础设施奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, the proliferation of
autonomous agents has introduced new challenges in interoperability,
scalability, and coordination. The Internet of Agents (IoA) aims to
interconnect heterogeneous agents through standardized communication protocols,
enabling seamless collaboration and intelligent task execution. However,
existing agent communication protocols such as MCP, A2A, and ANP remain
fragmented and scenario-specific. To address this gap, we propose Agent
Collaboration Protocols (ACPs), a comprehensive protocol suite for the IoA.
ACPs include registration, discovery, interaction, and tooling protocols to
support trustable access, capability orchestration, and workflow construction.
We present the architecture, key technologies, and application workflows of
ACPs, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a collaborative restaurant booking
scenario. ACPs lay the foundation for building a secure, open, and scalable

Motivation: 现有的AutoML系统仍需大量人工配置和专家输入，尤其是在处理多模态数据时。MLZero旨在通过多代理框架和LLM实现更高效、自动化的机器学习。

Method: MLZero采用认知感知模块将多模态输入转换为感知上下文，并通过语义和情景记忆增强代码生成，解决了LLM的幻觉代码和过时API问题。

Result: MLZero在MLE-Bench Lite上表现最佳，获得六枚金牌；在Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark上成功率达92%，排名2.28，显著优于竞争对手。

Conclusion: MLZero展示了在多模态数据自动化处理中的强大能力，即使使用小型LLM也能优于现有方案。

Abstract: Existing AutoML systems have advanced the automation of machine learning
(ML); however, they still require substantial manual configuration and expert
input, particularly when handling multimodal data. We introduce MLZero, a novel
multi-agent framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables
end-to-end ML automation across diverse data modalities with minimal human
intervention. A cognitive perception module is first employed, transforming raw
multimodal inputs into perceptual context that effectively guides the
subsequent workflow. To address key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinated
code generation and outdated API knowledge, we enhance the iterative code
generation process with semantic and episodic memory. MLZero demonstrates
superior performance on MLE-Bench Lite, outperforming all competitors in both
success rate and solution quality, securing six gold medals. Additionally, when
evaluated on our Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark, which includes 25 more
challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the
competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and
an average rank of 2.28. Our approach maintains its robust effectiveness even

Method: 提出了一种结合分布式梯度下降和Friedkin-Johnsen模型的分布式学习算法。

Result: 通过数值实验验证了算法的有效性，能够在恶意代理存在的情况下实现高全局精度。

Conclusion: 该算法通过参数调整可实现更个性化或更弹性的行为，适应多种分布式学习任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in
multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience.
Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models
tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the
other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous
training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between
these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that
combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion
dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the
neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily
controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more
personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of
our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it
achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious
agents compared to standard strategies.

Abstract: Finding interesting phenomena is the core of scientific discovery, but it is
a manual, ill-defined concept. We present an integrative pipeline for
automating the discovery of interesting simple hypotheses (feature-target
relations with effect direction and a potential underlying mechanism) in
structured biomedical data. The pipeline combines machine learning, knowledge
graphs, literature search and Large Language Models. We formalize
"interestingness" as a combination of novelty, utility and plausibility. On 8
major diseases from the UK Biobank, our pipeline consistently recovers risk
factors years before their appearance in the literature. 40--53% of our top
candidates were validated as interesting, compared to 0--7% for a SHAP-based
baseline. Overall, 28% of 109 candidates were interesting to medical experts.
The pipeline addresses the challenge of operationalizing "interestingness"
scalably and for any target. We release data and code:

Conclusion: 该方法为自主、原子级结构定向合成提供了通用蓝图，可能彻底改变材料设计。

Abstract: Controlled synthesis of materials with specified atomic structures underpins
technological advances yet remains reliant on iterative, trial-and-error
approaches. Nanoparticles (NPs), whose atomic arrangement dictates their
emergent properties, are particularly challenging to synthesise due to numerous
tunable parameters. Here, we introduce an autonomous approach explicitly
targeting synthesis of atomic-scale structures. Our method autonomously designs
synthesis protocols by matching real time experimental total scattering (TS)
and pair distribution function (PDF) data to simulated target patterns, without
requiring prior synthesis knowledge. We demonstrate this capability at a
synchrotron, successfully synthesising two structurally distinct gold NPs: 5 nm
decahedral and 10 nm face-centred cubic structures. Ultimately, specifying a
simulated target scattering pattern, thus representing a bespoke atomic
structure, and obtaining both the synthesised material and its reproducible
synthesis protocol on demand may revolutionise materials design. Thus,
ScatterLab provides a generalisable blueprint for autonomous, atomic
structure-targeted synthesis across diverse systems and applications.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了通过路径积分分子动力学（PIMD）结合机器学习势能（MTP）来研究核量子效应（NQEs）对材料性质的影响，实现了高精度且计算高效的方法。

Motivation: 核量子效应（NQEs）在有限温度下会显著改变材料性质，但传统方法如经验势能缺乏精度，量子力学计算则计算成本高。机器学习势能提供了一种平衡方案。

Method: 开发了一个接口，将MLIP-2软件包中的矩张量势能（MTP）与i-PI软件包中的PIMD计算集成，用于主动学习势能和研究NQEs。

Result: 通过锂氢化物（LiH）和硅（Si）系统的晶格参数、热膨胀系数和径向分布函数的研究，MTP-PIMD方法展示了高精度和有效性。

Conclusion: MTP-PIMD方法在保持计算效率的同时，提供了接近量子力学精度的结果，适用于研究NQEs对材料性质的影响。

Abstract: Accounting for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can significantly alter
material properties at finite temperatures. Atomic modeling using the
path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method can fully account for such
effects, but requires computationally efficient and accurate models of
interatomic interactions. Empirical potentials are fast but may lack sufficient
accuracy, whereas quantum-mechanical calculations are highly accurate but
computationally expensive. Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer a
solution to this challenge, providing near-quantum-mechanical accuracy while
maintaining high computational efficiency compared to density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. In this context, an interface was developed to integrate
moment tensor potentials (MTPs) from the MLIP-2 software package into PIMD
calculations using the i-PI software package. This interface was then applied
to active learning of potentials and to investigate the influence of NQEs on
material properties, namely the temperature dependence of lattice parameters
and thermal expansion coefficients, as well as radial distribution functions,
for lithium hydride (LiH) and silicon (Si) systems. The results were compared
with experimental data, quasi-harmonic approximation calculations, and
predictions from the universal machine learning force field MatterSim. These
comparisons demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of the MTP-PIMD
approach.

intensity gate is presented to seamless fuse emotional features with Phonetic
PosteriorGrams from a pre-trained ASR model. To further improve emotion

Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora
spanning its three major dialects-\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress
in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot,
multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel
dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our
method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized
Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and
linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity.
Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS
significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and
speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the
synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion
task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for
Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale

Abstract: Despite significant progress in neural spoken dialog systems,
personality-aware conversation agents -- capable of adapting behavior based on
personalities -- remain underexplored due to the absence of personality
annotations in speech datasets. We propose a pipeline that preprocesses raw
audio recordings to create a dialogue dataset annotated with timestamps,
response types, and emotion/sentiment labels. We employ an automatic speech
recognition (ASR) system to extract transcripts and timestamps, then generate
conversation-level annotations. Leveraging these annotations, we design a
system that employs large language models to predict conversational
personality. Human evaluators were engaged to identify conversational
characteristics and assign personality labels. Our analysis demonstrates that
the proposed system achieves stronger alignment with human judgments compared
to existing approaches.

Abstract: End-to-end speech large language models ((LLMs)) extend the capabilities of

systematically evaluate this gap, we propose S2SBench, a benchmark designed to
quantify performance degradation in Speech LLMs. It includes diagnostic
datasets targeting sentence continuation and commonsense reasoning under audio
input. We further introduce a pairwise evaluation protocol based on perplexity
differences between plausible and implausible samples to measure degradation
relative to text input. We apply S2SBench to analyze the training process of
Baichuan-Audio, which further demonstrates the benchmark's effectiveness. All

TL;DR: PAST是一个端到端框架，联合建模语音信息和信号重建，无需依赖外部预训练模型，直接整合领域知识并通过辅助任务优化。

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练自监督模型，PAST旨在通过监督语音数据直接整合领域知识，提升语音表现力和实时应用能力。

Method: PAST利用监督语音数据和辅助任务进行联合建模，并开发了可流式处理的因果变体以实现实时应用。

Result: PAST在语音表示和重建任务上超越现有基准方法，并在语音语言模型中表现出色。

Conclusion: PAST为语音生成任务提供了高效基础框架，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic
information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external
pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained
self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly
integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks.
Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling
real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing
evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including
phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves
superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech
language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for
spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full
implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新标准，用于提升能量基模型的一阶优化性能，对比了噪声对比估计和切片分数匹配的优缺点。

Motivation: 现有的噪声对比估计（NCE）和切片分数匹配（SSM）方法忽略了似然函数的形式问题，影响了能量基模型和扩散模型中的一阶优化性能。

Method: 提出了一种新标准，通过更适应一阶优化方案的分数学习方法来改进模型训练。

Result: 实验对比了新方法与传统NCE和SSM在训练能量基模型中的表现。

Conclusion: 新方法能够更有效地训练模型，尤其是在一阶优化场景中。

Abstract: Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) is a popular method for training
energy-based models (EBM) with intractable normalisation terms. The key idea of
NCE is to learn by comparing unnormalised log-likelihoods of the reference and
noisy samples, thus avoiding explicitly computing normalisation terms. However,
NCE critically relies on the quality of noisy samples. Recently, sliced score
matching (SSM) has been popularised by closely related diffusion models (DM).
Unlike NCE, SSM learns a gradient of log-likelihood, or score, by learning
distribution of its projections on randomly chosen directions. However, both
NCE and SSM disregard the form of log-likelihood function, which is problematic
given that EBMs and DMs make use of first-order optimisation during inference.
This paper proposes a new criterion that learns scores more suitable for
first-order schemes. Experiments contrasts these approaches for training EBMs.

TL;DR: AquaSignal是一个模块化、可扩展的水下声学信号处理管道，结合了深度学习方法，用于去噪、分类和新颖性检测，在真实海洋环境中表现出色。

Motivation: 由于水下声学信号在嘈杂和动态的海洋环境中难以分析，AquaSignal旨在通过深度学习技术提高分析的可靠性和准确性。

Method: AquaSignal采用U-Net去噪，ResNet18分类已知声学事件，AutoEncoder检测异常信号，并在Deepship和ONC数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，AquaSignal在分类和新颖性检测中的准确率分别为71%和91%，信号清晰度和任务性能显著提升。

Conclusion: AquaSignal在实时水下声学监测方面具有潜力，适用于科学、环境和海洋领域。

Abstract: This paper presents AquaSignal, a modular and scalable pipeline for
preprocessing, denoising, classification, and novelty detection of underwater
acoustic signals. Designed to operate effectively in noisy and dynamic marine
environments, AquaSignal integrates state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures to enhance the reliability and accuracy of acoustic signal
analysis. The system is evaluated on a combined dataset from the Deepship and
Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) benchmarks, providing a diverse set of real-world
underwater scenarios. AquaSignal employs a U-Net architecture for denoising, a
ResNet18 convolutional neural network for classifying known acoustic events,
and an AutoEncoder-based model for unsupervised detection of novel or anomalous
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to apply and
evaluate this combination of techniques on maritime vessel acoustic data.
Experimental results show that AquaSignal improves signal clarity and task
performance, achieving 71% classification accuracy and 91% accuracy in novelty
detection. Despite slightly lower classification performance compared to some
state-of-the-art models, differences in data partitioning strategies limit
direct comparisons. Overall, AquaSignal demonstrates strong potential for
real-time underwater acoustic monitoring in scientific, environmental, and
maritime domains.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了聚合物科学中数据碎片化问题，阻碍了能源技术的材料发现，提出了通过技术与合作创新解决这些问题的方案。

Motivation: 能源技术中聚合物材料的复杂性和数据碎片化问题，限制了机器学习的应用和材料发现，亟需解决方案。

Method: 采用自然语言处理工具从文献中提取结构化数据，结合高通量机器人平台生成自洽数据集，并应用FAIR原则。

Result: 通过技术和协作创新，逐步解决数据碎片化问题，为聚合物材料的发现和机器学习应用提供支持。

Conclusion: 未来突破依赖于开放科学文化、去中心化数据市场和自主实验室的融合，以技术创新解决数据障碍。

Abstract: The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning
photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by
fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of
these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing
reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with
unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation
stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of
materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound
the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to
proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit
critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine
cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases
limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions
address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural
language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of
literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent
datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the
adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles,
adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and
reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open
science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories
that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing
data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance,
and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into
accelerants.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多智能体框架的自适应AI系统，利用大型语言模型（LLM）和强化学习（RL）驱动智能体，实现表单文档中字母数字数据的自动化提取和自我改进。

Motivation: 传统的基于OCR和单一流水线的数据提取方法存在局限性，无法系统性改进。本文旨在通过多智能体框架解决LLM提取的不确定性，实现自动化且无需人工干预的信息提取。

Method: 采用了模块化的多智能体框架，结合任务特定提示和RL策略（奖励与惩罚），通过元提示智能体学习过去错误并改进基于提示的提取智能体。

Result: 在SOIRE和CORD两个基准数据集上的实验结果显示了该框架的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应系统能够处理多样化的文档和布局，提高了信息提取的准确性和自动化程度。

Abstract: Extracting alphanumeric data from form-like documents such as invoices,
purchase orders, bills, and financial documents is often performed via vision
(OCR) and learning algorithms or monolithic pipelines with limited potential
for systemic improvements. We propose an agentic AI system that leverages Large
Language Model (LLM) agents and a reinforcement learning (RL) driver agent to
automate consistent, self-improving extraction under LLM inference uncertainty.
Our work highlights the limitations of monolithic LLM-based extraction and
introduces a modular, multi-agent framework with task-specific prompts and an
RL policy of rewards and penalties to guide a meta-prompting agent to learn
from past errors and improve prompt-based actor agents. This self-corrective
adaptive system handles diverse documents, file formats, layouts, and LLMs,
aiming to automate accurate information extraction without the need for human
intervention. Results as reported on two benchmark datasets of SOIRE, and CORD,
are promising for the agentic AI framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多模态教材问答方法JETRTQA，通过多目标联合训练增强语义表示，显著提升了复杂教育场景中的文档检索效果。

Motivation: 教材问答任务需要复杂的多模态上下文理解，现有方法在准确语义对齐和任务特定文档检索方面存在不足，JETRTQA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: JETRTQA是一个基于检索-生成架构的多模态学习框架，通过多目标联合训练（包括成对排序和答案隐含监督）优化语义表示。

Result: 在CK12-QA数据集上，JETRTQA显著优于现有方法，验证集准确率提升2.4%，测试集提升11.1%。

Conclusion: JETRTQA通过改进语义表示和文档检索相关性，为复杂教育场景下的多模态教材问答提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Textbook question answering (TQA) is a complex task, requiring the
interpretation of complex multimodal context. Although recent advances have
improved overall performance, they often encounter difficulties in educational
settings where accurate semantic alignment and task-specific document retrieval
are essential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to multimodal
textbook question answering by introducing a mechanism for enhancing semantic
representations through multi-objective joint training. Our model, Joint
Embedding Training With Ranking Supervision for Textbook Question Answering
(JETRTQA), is a multimodal learning framework built on a retriever--generator
architecture that uses a retrieval-augmented generation setup, in which a
multimodal large language model generates answers. JETRTQA is designed to
improve the relevance of retrieved documents in complex educational contexts.
Unlike traditional direct scoring approaches, JETRTQA learns to refine the
semantic representations of questions and documents through a supervised signal
that combines pairwise ranking and implicit supervision derived from answers.
We evaluate our method on the CK12-QA dataset and demonstrate that it
significantly improves the discrimination between informative and irrelevant
documents, even when they are long, complex, and multimodal. JETRTQA
outperforms the previous state of the art, achieving a 2.4\% gain in accuracy
on the validation set and 11.1\% on the test set.

TL;DR: 提出GA-LLM框架，结合地理坐标和POI转移关系，提升LLM在POI推荐中的表现。

Motivation: 解决LLM在空间任务中难以建模精确地理信息与POI转移关系的挑战。

Method: 通过GCIM模块编码地理坐标，PAM模块整合POI转移关系。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: GA-LLM有效结合了地理信息和语义理解，提升推荐精确度。

Abstract: The next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict users'
next destinations based on their historical movement data and plays a key role
in location-based services and personalized applications. Accurate next POI
recommendation depends on effectively modeling geographic information and POI
transition relations, which are crucial for capturing spatial dependencies and
user movement patterns. While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong
capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual reasoning, applying them
to spatial tasks like next POI recommendation remains challenging. First, the
infrequent nature of specific GPS coordinates makes it difficult for LLMs to
model precise spatial contexts. Second, the lack of knowledge about POI
transitions limits their ability to capture potential POI-POI relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GA-LLM (Geography-Aware Large Language Model),
a novel framework that enhances LLMs with two specialized components. The
Geographic Coordinate Injection Module (GCIM) transforms GPS coordinates into
spatial representations using hierarchical and Fourier-based positional
encoding, enabling the model to understand geographic features from multiple
perspectives. The POI Alignment Module (PAM) incorporates POI transition
relations into the LLM's semantic space, allowing it to infer global POI
relationships and generalize to unseen POIs. Experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GA-LLM.

TL;DR: 总结：本文提出了Agent4SR框架，利用LLM代理进行高影响力的虚假用户攻击，通过生成评分和评论来操纵推荐系统，实验表明其有效性和隐蔽性优于现有方法。

Motivation: 动机：推荐系统容易受到虚假用户攻击，传统方法依赖简单启发式且忽略文本评论的潜在影响，因此需要更高效和隐蔽的攻击策略。

Method: 方法：使用基于LLM的代理Agent4SR，模拟真实用户行为，通过目标画像构建、混合记忆检索和评论攻击策略来增强操纵效果。

Result: 结果：在多数据集和推荐系统架构上的实验显示，Agent4SR在攻击效果和隐蔽性上优于现有低知识基线方法。

Conclusion: 结论：LLM驱动的代理带来了新的威胁，凸显了现代推荐系统急需加强防御措施。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are increasingly vulnerable to shilling attacks,
where adversaries inject fake user profiles to manipulate system outputs.
Traditional attack strategies often rely on simplistic heuristics, require
access to internal RS data, and overlook the manipulation potential of textual
reviews. In this work, we introduce Agent4SR, a novel framework that leverages
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents to perform low-knowledge, high-impact
shilling attacks through both rating and review generation. Agent4SR simulates
realistic user behavior by orchestrating adversarial interactions, selecting
items, assigning ratings, and crafting reviews, while maintaining behavioral
plausibility. Our design includes targeted profile construction, hybrid memory
retrieval, and a review attack strategy that propagates target item features
across unrelated reviews to amplify manipulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets and RS architectures demonstrate that Agent4SR outperforms
existing low-knowledge baselines in both effectiveness and stealth. Our
findings reveal a new class of emergent threats posed by LLM-driven agents,
underscoring the urgent need for enhanced defenses in modern recommender
systems.

TL;DR: BLOCKIE是一种基于LLM的新方法，通过将VRD组织为可重用的语义块进行独立处理，优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有方法在VRD信息提取中缺乏推理能力，难以处理未明确提及的值或新格式文档。

Method: 将VRD分解为独立的语义块，通过局部化推理处理每个块。

Result: 在F1分数上比现有方法高1-3%，对未见过格式的文档也具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BLOCKIE提高了VRD信息提取的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Information extraction (IE) from Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) containing
layout features along with text is a critical and well-studied task.
Specialized non-LLM NLP-based solutions typically involve training models using
both textual and geometric information to label sequences/tokens as named
entities or answers to specific questions. However, these approaches lack
reasoning, are not able to infer values not explicitly present in documents,
and do not generalize well to new formats. Generative LLM-based approaches
proposed recently are capable of reasoning, but struggle to comprehend clues
from document layout especially in previously unseen document formats, and do
not show competitive performance in heterogeneous VRD benchmark datasets. In
this paper, we propose BLOCKIE, a novel LLM-based approach that organizes VRDs
into localized, reusable semantic textual segments called $\textit{semantic
blocks}$, which are processed independently. Through focused and more
generalizable reasoning,our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on public
VRD benchmarks by 1-3% in F1 scores, is resilient to document formats
previously not encountered and shows abilities to correctly extract information
not explicitly present in documents.

Result: 实验表明，RAGXplain的评估与人类判断高度一致，且其改进建议能显著提升系统性能。

Conclusion: RAGXplain填补了定量评估与实际优化之间的鸿沟，帮助用户更好地理解和增强AI系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems show promise by coupling large
language models with external knowledge, yet traditional RAG evaluation methods
primarily report quantitative scores while offering limited actionable guidance
for refining these complex pipelines. In this paper, we introduce RAGXplain, an
evaluation framework that quantifies RAG performance and translates these
assessments into clear insights that clarify the workings of its complex,
multi-stage pipeline and offer actionable recommendations. Using LLM reasoning,
RAGXplain converts raw scores into coherent narratives identifying performance
gaps and suggesting targeted improvements. By providing transparent
explanations for AI decision-making, our framework fosters user trust-a key
challenge in AI adoption. Our LLM-based metric assessments show strong
alignment with human judgments, and experiments on public question-answering
datasets confirm that applying RAGXplain's actionable recommendations
measurably improves system performance. RAGXplain thus bridges quantitative
evaluation and practical optimization, empowering users to understand, trust,

Motivation: 在高风险应用中，LLMs必须避免对超出知识库的问题产生幻觉回答，现有方法缺乏自动评估能力。

Method: 开发了knowornot工具，提供统一API、模块化架构、数据建模和定制工具，用于评估OOKB鲁棒性。

Result: 通过PolicyBench基准测试展示了knowornot的实用性，分析了四个政府政策问答机器人的OOKB鲁棒性。

Conclusion: knowornot为评估LLMs的OOKB鲁棒性提供了高效、灵活的工具，支持定制化评估和扩展。

Abstract: While the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have progressed
significantly, their use in high-stakes applications have been limited due to
risks of hallucination. One key approach in reducing hallucination is
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but even in such setups, LLMs may still
hallucinate when presented with questions outside of the knowledge base. Such
behavior is unacceptable in high-stake applications where LLMs are expected to
abstain from answering queries it does not have sufficient context on. In this
work, we present a novel methodology for systematically evaluating
out-of-knowledge base (OOKB) robustness of LLMs (whether LLMs know or do not
know) in the RAG setting, without the need for manual annotation of gold
standard answers. We implement our methodology in knowornot, an open-source
library that enables users to develop their own customized evaluation data and
pipelines for OOKB robustness. knowornot comprises four main features. Firstly,
it provides a unified, high-level API that streamlines the process of setting
up and running robustness benchmarks. Secondly, its modular architecture
emphasizes extensibility and flexibility, allowing users to easily integrate
their own LLM clients and RAG settings. Thirdly, its rigorous data modeling
design ensures experiment reproducibility, reliability and traceability.
Lastly, it implements a comprehensive suite of tools for users to customize
their pipelines. We demonstrate the utility of knowornot by developing a
challenging benchmark, PolicyBench, which spans four Question-Answer (QA)
chatbots on government policies, and analyze its OOKB robustness. The source
code of knowornot is available

Motivation: 当前缺乏对JIR任务的系统定义和评估方法，需要填补这一空白，以提升JIR系统的开发和评测能力。

Method: 通过JIR-Arena数据集，结合人类和AI模型的输入，评估用户信息需求推断、推荐相关性和内容检索效果。

Result: 实验表明，基于基础模型的JIR系统能合理模拟用户需求，但在召回率和内容检索方面仍有挑战。

Conclusion: JIR-Arena为未来研究提供了标准化的评估工具，促进JIR领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Just-in-time Information Recommendation (JIR) is a service designed to
deliver the most relevant information precisely when users need it, ,
addressing their knowledge gaps with minimal effort and boosting
decision-making and efficiency in daily life. Advances in device-efficient
deployment of foundation models and the growing use of intelligent wearable
devices have made always-on JIR assistants feasible. However, there has been no
systematic effort to formally define JIR tasks or establish evaluation
frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present the first mathematical definition of
JIR tasks and associated evaluation metrics. Additionally, we introduce
JIR-Arena, a multimodal benchmark dataset featuring diverse,
information-request-intensive scenarios to evaluate JIR systems across critical
dimensions: i) accurately inferring user information needs, ii) delivering
timely and relevant recommendations, and iii) avoiding irrelevant content that
may distract users.
  Developing a JIR benchmark dataset poses challenges due to subjectivity in
estimating user information needs and uncontrollable system variables affecting
reproducibility. To address these, JIR-Arena: i) combines input from multiple
humans and large AI models to approximate information need distributions; ii)
assesses JIR quality through information retrieval outcomes using static
knowledge base snapshots; and iii) employs a multi-turn, multi-entity
validation framework to improve objectivity and generality. Furthermore, we
implement a baseline JIR system capable of processing real-time information
streams aligned with user inputs. Our evaluation of this baseline system on
JIR-Arena indicates that while foundation model-based JIR systems simulate user
needs with reasonable precision, they face challenges in recall and effective
content retrieval. To support future research in this new area, we fully
release our code and data.

Motivation: 当前QA任务的基准测试缺乏元数据整合，限制了在需要结合文本和外部信息场景下的评估。

Method: 通过收集110万条来自26个公共Telegram群的英文消息，并添加时间戳、主题、情绪和毒性指标等元数据，构建AMAQA数据集，包含450个高质量QA对。

Result: 利用元数据可将准确率从0.12提升到0.61。通过迭代上下文和添加噪声文档的策略，性能在最佳基线基础上再提升3点，比简单元数据过滤高出14点。

Conclusion: AMAQA为元数据驱动的QA和RAG系统研究提供了新标准，展示了元数据在提升任务性能中的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely used in
question-answering (QA) tasks, but current benchmarks lack metadata
integration, hindering evaluation in scenarios requiring both textual data and
external information. To address this, we present AMAQA, a new open-access QA
dataset designed to evaluate tasks combining text and metadata. The integration
of metadata is especially important in fields that require rapid analysis of
large volumes of data, such as cybersecurity and intelligence, where timely
access to relevant information is critical. AMAQA includes about 1.1 million
English messages collected from 26 public Telegram groups, enriched with
metadata such as timestamps, topics, emotional tones, and toxicity indicators,
which enable precise and contextualized queries by filtering documents based on
specific criteria. It also includes 450 high-quality QA pairs, making it a
valuable resource for advancing research on metadata-driven QA and RAG systems.
To the best of our knowledge, AMAQA is the first single-hop QA benchmark to
incorporate metadata and labels such as topics covered in the messages. We
conduct extensive tests on the benchmark, establishing a new standard for
future research. We show that leveraging metadata boosts accuracy from 0.12 to
0.61, highlighting the value of structured context. Building on this, we
explore several strategies to refine the LLM input by iterating over provided
context and enriching it with noisy documents, achieving a further 3-point gain
over the best baseline and a 14-point improvement over simple metadata
filtering. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 现有嵌入模型在医学文档语义捕捉、长文档处理和通用任务中表现不佳，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: MedEIR结合ALiBi长上下文处理技术，预训练60亿token，微调300万句对。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，MedEIR在ArguAna、NFCorpus等多任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: MedEIR展示了跨领域任务的强大性能，是现有嵌入模型的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Embedding models have become essential for retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) tasks, semantic clustering, and text re-ranking. But despite their
growing use, many of these come with notable limitations. For example, Jina
fails to capture the semantic content of medical documents, while models such
as MiniLM often perform poorly on long-form documents. Domain-adapted models,
while specialized, often underperform in general-purpose tasks, reducing their
overall applicability. General-domain tokenizers often misinterpret medical
vocabulary. The limitations of current embedding models, whether in
tokenization accuracy, domain comprehension, or handling long sequences,
highlight the need for more versatile solutions. In this work, we present
MedEIR, a novel embedding model and tokenizer jointly optimized for both
medical and general NLP tasks, incorporating ALiBi-based long-context
processing to support sequences of up to 8,192 tokens. MedEIR was pre-trained
on only 6 billion tokens, significantly fewer than Jina's, followed by
fine-tuning on 3 million sentence pairs. MedEIR consistently outperforms Jina
V2 and MiniLM across MTEB benchmarks, achieving top scores on ArguAna (55.24),
NFCorpus (38.44), MedicalQARetrieval (74.25), SciFact (72.04), and TRECCOVID

Conclusion: RAR无需改变现有RAG系统的架构，仅需添加专门设计的文档和基于检索结果的简单拒绝机制，即可实现高效审核。

Abstract: Content moderation for large language models (LLMs) remains a significant
challenge, requiring flexible and adaptable solutions that can quickly respond
to emerging threats. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Rejection (RAR),
a novel approach that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
architecture to dynamically reject unsafe user queries without model
retraining. By strategically inserting and marking malicious documents into the
vector database, the system can identify and reject harmful requests when these
documents are retrieved. Our preliminary results show that RAR achieves
comparable performance to embedded moderation in LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
while offering superior flexibility and real-time customization capabilities, a
fundamental feature to timely address critical vulnerabilities. This approach
introduces no architectural changes to existing RAG systems, requiring only the
addition of specially crafted documents and a simple rejection mechanism based
on retrieval results.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of pre-trained large language models (LLMs),
recent endeavors have leveraged the capabilities of LLMs in relevance modeling,
resulting in enhanced performance. This is usually done through the process of
fine-tuning LLMs on specifically annotated datasets to determine the relevance
between queries and items. However, there are two limitations when LLMs are
naively employed for relevance modeling through fine-tuning and inference.
First, it is not inherently efficient for performing nuanced tasks beyond
simple yes or no answers, such as assessing search relevance. It may therefore
tend to be overconfident and struggle to distinguish fine-grained degrees of
relevance (e.g., strong relevance, weak relevance, irrelevance) used in search
engines. Second, it exhibits significant performance degradation when
confronted with data distribution shift in real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel Distribution-Aware Robust Learning framework (DaRL) for
relevance modeling in Alipay Search. Specifically, we design an effective loss
function to enhance the discriminability of LLM-based relevance modeling across
various fine-grained degrees of query-item relevance. To improve the
generalizability of LLM-based relevance modeling, we first propose the
Distribution-Aware Sample Augmentation (DASA) module. This module utilizes
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection techniques to actively select appropriate
samples that are not well covered by the original training set for model
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-stage fine-tuning strategy to
simultaneously improve in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance, bridging the
performance gap between them. DaRL has been deployed online to serve the
Alipay's insurance product search...

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoRank的无训练、模型无关的科学检索重排框架，通过紧凑文档表示和混合设计提升性能。

Motivation: 科学检索中，传统基于大语言模型（LLM）的列表重排方法因首阶段检索效果不佳和上下文窗口限制，无法充分利用相关文档。

Method: CoRank框架分三个阶段：离线提取文档级特征、基于紧凑表示的粗粒度重排、以及对候选文档全文的细粒度重排。

Result: 在LitSearch和CSFCube上的实验表明，CoRank显著提升了重排性能，nDCG@10从32.0提高到39.7。

Conclusion: 信息提取对科学检索重排具有重要价值，紧凑表示与混合设计是有效解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific retrieval is essential for advancing academic discovery. Within
this process, document reranking plays a critical role by refining first-stage
retrieval results. However, large language model (LLM) listwise reranking faces
unique challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often
suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower.
Moreover, conventional listwise reranking uses the full text of candidate
documents in the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be
considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking,
which constrains overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we
explore compact document representations based on semantic features such as
categories, sections, and keywords, and propose a training-free, model-agnostic
reranking framework for scientific retrieval called CoRank. The framework
involves three stages: (i) offline extraction of document-level features, (ii)
coarse reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained
reranking on full texts of the top candidates from stage (ii). This hybrid
design provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands
candidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking.
Experiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves
reranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from
32.0 to 39.7. Overall, these results highlight the value of information
extraction for reranking in scientific retrieval.

Motivation: 现有LLM增强的CTR方法在处理大规模实例或用户/物品实体时计算开销大，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: LLaCTR利用LLM从小规模特征字段中提炼轻量级语义知识，通过自监督的字段-特征微调，增强特征表示和特征交互。

Result: 在四个数据集上与六种代表性CTR模型集成，LLaCTR在效果和效率上均优于现有LLM增强方法。

Conclusion: LLaCTR是一种高效且有效的轻量化LLM增强CTR方法。

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental task in modern
recommender systems. In recent years, the integration of large language models
(LLMs) has been shown to effectively enhance the performance of traditional CTR
methods. However, existing LLM-enhanced methods often require extensive
processing of detailed textual descriptions for large-scale instances or
user/item entities, leading to substantial computational overhead. To address
this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight
LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm.
Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight
semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised
field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic
knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In
our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across
four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both
effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLaCTR-EC46.

TL;DR: Rank-K是一种基于大型语言模型的列表式段落重排序模型，显著提升了检索效率，尤其在多语言环境下表现优异。

Motivation: 现有的神经重排序模型虽然效果显著，但资源消耗巨大。为了提升效率和可扩展性，研究提出了Rank-K。

Method: Rank-K利用大型语言模型的推理能力，对初始排名列表进行列表式段落重排序，并优化查询时间的计算效率。

Result: Rank-K在BM25初始排名和SPLADE-v3强检索结果上分别提升了23%和19%的检索效果，且在多语言环境下同样有效。

Conclusion: Rank-K不仅显著提升了检索效果，还具有多语言适应性，为资源密集型任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieve-and-rerank is a popular retrieval pipeline because of its ability to
make slow but effective rerankers efficient enough at query time by reducing
the number of comparisons. Recent works in neural rerankers take advantage of
large language models for their capability in reasoning between queries and
passages and have achieved state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness. However,
such rerankers are resource-intensive, even after heavy optimization. In this
work, we introduce Rank-K, a listwise passage reranking model that leverages
the reasoning capability of the reasoning language model at query time that
provides test time scalability to serve hard queries. We show that Rank-K
improves retrieval effectiveness by 23\% over the RankZephyr, the
state-of-the-art listwise reranker, when reranking a BM25 initial ranked list
and 19\% when reranking strong retrieval results by SPLADE-v3. Since Rank-K is
inherently a multilingual model, we found that it ranks passages based on
queries in different languages as effectively as it does in monolingual
retrieval.

Result: 在多个领域的数据实验中表现优异，并成功应用于淘宝App的实际推荐场景。

Conclusion: TranSUN和GTS通过内置修正有效解决了偏差问题，具有理论和实践的双重优势。

Abstract: Regression models are crucial in recommender systems. However,
retransformation bias problem has been conspicuously neglected within the
community. While many works in other fields have devised effective bias
correction methods, all of them are post-hoc cures externally to the model,
facing practical challenges when applied to real-world recommender systems.
Hence, we propose a preemptive paradigm to eradicate the bias intrinsically
from the models via minor model refinement. Specifically, a novel TranSUN
method is proposed with a joint bias learning manner to offer theoretically
guaranteed unbiasedness under empirical superior convergence. It is further
generalized into a novel generic regression model family, termed Generalized
TranSUN (GTS), which not only offers more theoretical insights but also serves
as a generic framework for flexibly developing various bias-free models.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods
across data from various domains, which have been successfully deployed in two
real-world industrial recommendation scenarios, i.e. product and short video
recommendation scenarios in Guess What You Like business domain in the homepage
of Taobao App (a leading e-commerce platform), to serve the major online
traffic. Codes will be released after this paper is published.

TL;DR: NExT-Search提出了一种新的生成式AI搜索范式，通过引入细粒度的反馈机制解决传统反馈环的断开问题。

Motivation: 生成式AI搜索虽然提供了便捷的端到端答案，但失去了传统搜索基于用户反馈的持续改进能力，导致系统各阶段难以优化。

Method: 提出了NExT-Search，结合用户调试模式和影子用户模式，通过在线适应和离线更新收集并利用细粒度反馈。

Result: NExT-Search能够为生成式AI搜索系统提供持续的反馈，从而优化查询分解、检索和答案生成等环节。

Conclusion: NExT-Search为构建反馈丰富的AI搜索系统提供了可进化的方向。

Abstract: Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering
end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually
browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm
enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has
historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can
continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,
fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In
contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,
spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet
typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This
introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output
cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it
difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In
this paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to
reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.
NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows
engaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a
personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted
feedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these
feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines
current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates
interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and
generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative
AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for
building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside
human feedback.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CausalEPP的新方法，用于解决推荐系统中的流行度偏差问题，通过考虑用户对流行项目的偏好随时间演变的特点，显著提升了推荐准确性。

Motivation: 现有方法在缓解推荐系统的流行度偏差时，往往忽视了用户对流行项目偏好的差异性和时间演变特性，导致推荐效果不理想。

Method: 论文首先提出了一种名为“Evolving Personal Popularity”的度量方法，量化用户对流行项目的偏好；随后设计了一个因果图，并将演化个人流行度融入从众效应中，通过解纠缠训练来缓解偏差。

Result: 实验表明，CausalEPP在减少流行度偏差的同时，显著提高了推荐准确性，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CausalEPP通过动态建模用户对流行项目的偏好变化，有效解决了推荐系统中的流行度偏差问题，为个性化推荐提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Popularity bias occurs when popular items are recommended far more frequently
than they should be, negatively impacting both user experience and
recommendation accuracy. Existing debiasing methods mitigate popularity bias
often uniformly across all users and only partially consider the time evolution
of users or items. However, users have different levels of preference for item
popularity, and this preference is evolving over time. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method called CausalEPP (Causal Intervention on Evolving
Personal Popularity) for taming recommendation bias, which accounts for the
evolving personal popularity of users. Specifically, we first introduce a
metric called {Evolving Personal Popularity} to quantify each user's preference
for popular items. Then, we design a causal graph that integrates evolving
personal popularity into the conformity effect, and apply deconfounded training
to mitigate the popularity bias of the causal graph. During inference, we
consider the evolution consistency between users and items to achieve a better
recommendation. Empirical studies demonstrate that CausalEPP outperforms
baseline methods in reducing popularity bias while improving recommendation
accuracy.

Motivation: 传统元启发式算法因固定结构和调参限制，难以适应复杂优化问题。

Method: PMF利用PMA和PMSA代理，基于性能指标动态选择和切换算法。

Result: 在基准测试中，PMF显著提升收敛速度、适应性和解的质量，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PMF结合AI决策和自校正机制，为智能优化框架提供新方向。

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex optimization
problems, yet their effectiveness is often constrained by fixed structures and
the need for extensive tuning. The Polymorphic Metaheuristic Framework (PMF)
addresses this limitation by introducing a self-adaptive metaheuristic
switching mechanism driven by real-time performance feedback and dynamic
algorithmic selection. PMF leverages the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Agent (PMA)
and the Polymorphic Metaheuristic Selection Agent (PMSA) to dynamically select
and transition between metaheuristic algorithms based on key performance
indicators, ensuring continuous adaptation. This approach enhances convergence
speed, adaptability, and solution quality, outperforming traditional
metaheuristics in high-dimensional, dynamic, and multimodal environments.
Experimental results on benchmark functions demonstrate that PMF significantly
improves optimization efficiency by mitigating stagnation and balancing
exploration-exploitation strategies across various problem landscapes. By
integrating AI-driven decision-making and self-correcting mechanisms, PMF paves
the way for scalable, intelligent, and autonomous optimization frameworks, with
promising applications in engineering, logistics, and complex decision-making
systems.

Motivation: 探究AI偏见如何影响人类决策，特别是在招聘场景中，以及反事实解释的作用。

Method: 通过模拟招聘实验，分三个阶段（无AI、有偏见AI推荐、无AI）观察参与者决策，并引入反事实解释。

Result: 70%的决策受AI偏见影响，仅少数人察觉偏见；反事实解释能逆转偏见，但对信任度无显著影响。

Conclusion: 需谨慎设计可解释AI以避免偏见传播，确保公平决策。

Abstract: Although the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday tasks
improves efficiency and objectivity, it also risks transmitting bias to human
decision-making. In this study, we conducted a controlled experiment that
simulated hiring decisions to examine how biased AI recommendations - augmented
with or without counterfactual explanations - influence human judgment over
time. Participants, acting as hiring managers, completed 60 decision trials
divided into a baseline phase without AI, followed by a phase with biased (X)AI
recommendations (favoring either male or female candidates), and a final
post-interaction phase without AI. Our results indicate that the participants
followed the AI recommendations 70% of the time when the qualifications of the
given candidates were comparable. Yet, only a fraction of participants detected
the gender bias (8 out of 294). Crucially, exposure to biased AI altered
participants' inherent preferences: in the post-interaction phase,
participants' independent decisions aligned with the bias when no
counterfactual explanations were provided before, but reversed the bias when
explanations were given. Reported trust did not differ significantly across
conditions. Confidence varied throughout the study phases after exposure to
male-biased AI, indicating nuanced effects of AI bias on decision certainty.
Our findings point to the importance of calibrating XAI to avoid unintended
behavioral shifts in order to safeguard equitable decision-making and prevent
the adoption of algorithmic bias.

Abstract: Effective workplace communication is essential for managerial success, yet
many managers lack access to tailored and sustained training. Although
AI-assisted communication systems may offer scalable training solutions, little
is known about how managers envision the role of AI in helping them improve
their communication skills. To investigate this, we designed a conversational
role-play system, CommCoach, as a functional probe to understand how managers
anticipate using AI to practice their communication skills. Through
semi-structured interviews, participants emphasized the value of adaptive,
low-risk simulations for practicing difficult workplace conversations. They
also highlighted opportunities, including human-AI teaming, transparent and
context-aware feedback, and greater control over AI-generated personas.
AI-assisted communication training should balance personalization, structured
learning objectives, and adaptability to different user styles and contexts.
However, achieving this requires carefully navigating tensions between adaptive
and consistent AI feedback, realism and potential bias, and the open-ended
nature of AI conversations versus structured workplace discourse.

Abstract: Reputation systems play an essential role in the Internet era, as they enable
people to decide whom to trust, by collecting and aggregating data about users'
behavior. Recently, several works proposed the use of reputation for the design
and scalability improvement of decentralized (blockchain) ledgers; however,
such systems are prone to manipulation and to our knowledge no game-theoretic
treatment exists that can support their economic robustness.
  In this work we put forth a new model for the design of what we call, {\em
trustworthy reputation systems}. Concretely, we describe a class of games,
which we term {\em trustworthy reputation games}, that enable a set of users to
report a function of their beliefs about the trustworthiness of each server in
a set -- i.e., their estimate of the probability that this server will behave
according to its specified strategy -- in a way that satisfies the following
properties:
  1. It is $(\epsilon$-)best response for any rational user in the game to play
a prescribed (truthful) strategy according to their true belief.
  2. Assuming that the users' beliefs are not too far from the {\em true}
trustworthiness of the servers, playing the above ($\epsilon-$)Nash equilibrium
allows anyone who observes the users' strategies to estimate the relative
trustworthiness of any two servers.
  Our utilities and decoding function build on a connection between the well
known PageRank algorithm and the problem of trustworthiness discovery, which
can be of independent interest. Finally, we show how the above games are
motivated by and can be leveraged in proof-of-reputation (PoR) blockchains.

Motivation: 为了解决现有方法在计算Wasserstein重心时的复杂性和效率问题，作者提出了一种新的对偶形式和SGA算法，以简化计算并提高性能。

Method: 通过基于Sobolev几何的自适应梯度上升算法（SGA），避免了昂贵的c-凹投影操作，从而简化了算法并保证了全局收敛性。

Result: SGA算法在数值实验中表现出优于现有最优运输重心求解器的性能，同时保持了理论上的简洁性。

Conclusion: SGA算法提供了一种高效且理论上简化的方法来计算Wasserstein重心，避免了传统方法的复杂性，同时保持了收敛性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new constraint-free concave dual formulation for the
Wasserstein barycenter. Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to
the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA)
algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a
regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global
convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient
descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean
space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally
expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual
potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant
algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual
methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal
transport barycenter solvers.

Motivation: 双层优化问题具有复杂的层级依赖关系，现有方法通常需要调参且计算复杂，因此需要一种高效、无需调参的算法。

Method: 通过求解凸二次约束二次规划（QCQP）获得搜索方向，并利用基于控制障碍函数的回溯线搜索确保步长安全。

Conclusion: 该算法高效、可扩展，无需调参，在典型双层优化任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is
nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We
propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime
feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality
condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each
iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a
closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking
line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly
positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no
hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions.
We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate and demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.

Motivation: 研究多通道（面部与语音）情绪表达与同步的机制，以优化情绪识别系统和人机交互。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP数据集，通过EmoNet和Wav2Vec2提取情绪数据，分析对话片段的情绪对齐，包括皮尔逊相关、滞后调整分析和动态时间规整（DTW）。

Result: 非重叠对话的情绪同步更稳定且可预测；重叠对话情绪对齐更混乱，但DTW显示意外紧密的协调策略。

Abstract: Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple
communication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has
significant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer
interaction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes
clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony,
this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and
temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities.
Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous
emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech
audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional
alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was
associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than
overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically
different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for
arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer,
more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping
speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW
indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination
strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions
more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during
simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of
conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new
insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective
alignment in real world interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知神经场（DANF），通过Ambisonic格式的房间脉冲响应（RIR）更精确地捕捉声场的定向特性，并引入了方向感知损失。进一步研究了DANF在不同房间中的适应能力。

Motivation: 现有的神经场方法主要针对单声道或双声道听众，未能精确捕捉单个点的真实声场定向特性，因此需要更准确的表示方法。

Method: 提出了方向感知神经场（DANF），通过Ambisonic格式的RIR引入方向信息，并设计了方向感知损失函数。同时研究了DANF在新房间中的低秩适应能力。

Result: DANF能够更精确地表示声场的定向特性，并在新环境中表现出良好的适应能力。

Conclusion: DANF为声场建模提供了更精确的方向感知能力，同时展示了在不同环境中的适应性。

Abstract: The characteristics of a sound field are intrinsically linked to the
geometric and spatial properties of the environment surrounding a sound source
and a listener. The physics of sound propagation is captured in a time-domain
signal known as a room impulse response (RIR). Prior work using neural fields
(NFs) has allowed learning spatially-continuous representations of RIRs from
finite RIR measurements. However, previous NF-based methods have focused on
monaural omnidirectional or at most binaural listeners, which does not
precisely capture the directional characteristics of a real sound field at a
single point. We propose a direction-aware neural field (DANF) that more
explicitly incorporates the directional information by Ambisonic-format RIRs.
While DANF inherently captures spatial relations between sources and listeners,
we further propose a direction-aware loss. In addition, we investigate the
ability of DANF to adapt to new rooms in various ways including low-rank
adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过表面肌电图（EMG）信号预测发音特征的模型，结合卷积层和Transformer模块，并实现了高相关性的预测，同时首次通过发音特征将EMG信号解码为可理解的语音波形。

Motivation: 探索通过EMG信号预测发音特征并解码为语音波形的新方法，填补了EMG信号直接用于语音合成的空白。

Method: 整合卷积层和Transformer模块，结合独立的发音特征预测器，从EMG信号中预测发音特征并解码为语音波形。

Result: 预测的发音特征相关性达到约0.9，并成功解码为可理解的语音波形；分析了电极放置与特征预测的关系。

Conclusion: 该模型为EMG信号用于语音合成提供了新途径，同时为电极配置优化提供了依据。

Abstract: We present a model for predicting articulatory features from surface
electromyography (EMG) signals during speech production. The proposed model
integrates convolutional layers and a Transformer block, followed by separate
predictors for articulatory features. Our approach achieves a high prediction
correlation of approximately 0.9 for most articulatory features. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that these predicted articulatory features can be decoded into
intelligible speech waveforms. To our knowledge, this is the first method to
decode speech waveforms from surface EMG via articulatory features, offering a
novel approach to EMG-based speech synthesis. Additionally, we analyze the
relationship between EMG electrode placement and articulatory feature
predictability, providing knowledge-driven insights for optimizing EMG
electrode configurations. The source code and decoded speech samples are
publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语音语言模型（SLMs）在对抗性攻击中的脆弱性，并提出了一种无需重新训练的后处理修补防御方法，显著提高了安全性，同时几乎不影响实用性。

Motivation: 由于语音信号比文本更丰富，SLMs面临更高的安全风险，尤其是在对抗性攻击（如越狱攻击）中表现更为脆弱。因此，研究如何在不影响模型实用性的情况下提升其安全性至关重要。

Method: 采用后处理修补防御方法，通过修改SLM的激活函数来干预推理过程，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 提出的防御方法将SLMs的鲁棒性提升至99%，且对模型实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: 该研究为SLMs的安全性提供了一种高效的防御方案，同时保持了模型的高实用性。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) enable natural interactions via spoken
instructions, which more effectively capture user intent by detecting nuances
in speech. The richer speech signal introduces new security risks compared to
text-based models, as adversaries can better bypass safety mechanisms by
injecting imperceptible noise to speech. We analyze adversarial attacks and
find that SLMs are substantially more vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
can achieve a perfect 100% attack success rate in some instances. To improve
security, we propose post-hoc patching defenses used to intervene during
inference by modifying the SLM's activations that improve robustness up to 99%
with (i) negligible impact on utility and (ii) without any re-training. We
conduct ablation studies to maximize the efficacy of our defenses and improve
the utility/security trade-off, validated with large-scale benchmarks unique to
SLMs.

TL;DR: 本文旨在改进语音合成中口音相似性的主观和客观评估方法，提高了XAB听力测试的统计显著性，并利用发音相关指标评估口音生成。

Motivation: 目前对口音相似性评估的研究不足，尤其是在语音合成中生成高保真口音的需求日益增长的背景下。

Method: 主观方法：改进XAB听力测试，提供听众转录文本并标记口音差异；客观方法：使用基于元音共振峰和语音后验图的发音相关指标。

Result: 实验表明，这些指标可用于评估口音相似性、说话人相似性和Mel倒谱失真，同时揭示了常见指标（如词错误率）的局限性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为口音相似性评估提供了更有效的工具，尤其是在处理代表性不足的口音时。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in generating high-fidelity accents, evaluating
accent similarity in speech synthesis has been underexplored. We aim to enhance
both subjective and objective evaluation methods for accent similarity.
Subjectively, we refine the XAB listening test by adding components that
achieve higher statistical significance with fewer listeners and lower costs.
Our method involves providing listeners with transcriptions, having them
highlight perceived accent differences, and implementing meticulous screening
for reliability. Objectively, we utilise pronunciation-related metrics, based
on distances between vowel formants and phonetic posteriorgrams, to evaluate
accent generation. Comparative experiments reveal that these metrics, alongside
accent similarity, speaker similarity, and Mel Cepstral Distortion, can be
used. Moreover, our findings underscore significant limitations of common
metrics like Word Error Rate in assessing underrepresented accents.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖于难以获取的显式人口统计标签，而语音情感识别中的公平性问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出IDI模块，结合伪标签和k-means聚类，无需显式标签即可推断人口统计信息。

Result: 伪标签IDI将公平性指标提高了33%以上，同时准确率下降不到3%；无监督IDI提高了26%以上公平性指标，准确率下降不到4%。

Conclusion: IDI模块有效减少了种族和年龄偏见，适用于缺乏显式人口统计信息的场景。

Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in
computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition
(SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit
demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To
address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI)
module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised
learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show
that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness
metrics by over 33% with less than a 3% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the
unsupervised IDI yields more than a 26% improvement in fairness metrics with a
drop of less than 4% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the
unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating
its potential in scenarios where explicit demographic information is
unavailable.

Motivation: 现有音频感知大语言模型在处理音频输入时容易产生幻听现象，降低了可靠性。

Method: 采用LISTEN方法，通过对比训练使用合成的负样本数据，无需修改LLM参数，通过轻量适配器集成音频表示。

Result: LISTEN有效减少幻听现象，同时在现有音频问答和推理基准测试中表现优异，数据和计算效率更高。

Conclusion: LISTEN为提升ALLMs的可靠性提供了高效且无需额外参数的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) enable them
to process and understand audio inputs. However, these models often hallucinate
non-existent sound events, reducing their reliability in real-world
applications. To address this, we propose LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method that
enhances ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds using
synthesized data from the backbone LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method
requires no modification to LLM parameters and efficiently integrates audio
representations via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that LISTEN
effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining impressive performance
on existing audio question and reasoning benchmarks. At the same time, it is
more efficient in both data and computation.

Method: 采用条件流匹配方法，结合mel谱图输入，并针对相位重构任务提出新型声码器。

Result: FlowTSE在标准测试中表现优异，匹配或超越了现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlowTSE是一种简单高效的目标说话人提取方法，且在相位重构任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Target speaker extraction (TSE) aims to isolate a specific speaker's speech
from a mixture using speaker enrollment as a reference. While most existing
approaches are discriminative, recent generative methods for TSE achieve strong
results. However, generative methods for TSE remain underexplored, with most
existing approaches relying on complex pipelines and pretrained components,
leading to computational overhead. In this work, we present FlowTSE, a simple
yet effective TSE approach based on conditional flow matching. Our model
receives an enrollment audio sample and a mixed speech signal, both represented
as mel-spectrograms, with the objective of extracting the target speaker's
clean speech. Furthermore, for tasks where phase reconstruction is crucial, we
propose a novel vocoder conditioned on the complex STFT of the mixed signal,
enabling improved phase estimation. Experimental results on standard TSE
benchmarks show that FlowTSE matches or outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种弱引导的说话人提取方法，仅依赖目标的初始位置，以应对空间动态场景，解决了传统方法在动态环境中依赖强引导的问题。

Motivation: 传统基于深度非线性空间滤波的说话人提取方法在目标方向已知且固定的情况下表现优异，但在空间动态场景中，由于时空特征的变化和交叉说话人带来的模糊性问题，表现较差。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种弱引导提取方法，仅利用目标的初始位置，结合自研的深度跟踪算法和联合训练策略，通过合成数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效解决空间模糊性问题，甚至优于不匹配但强引导的提取方法。

Conclusion: 弱引导方法在空间动态场景中具有显著优势，为说话人提取提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent speaker extraction methods using deep non-linear spatial filtering
perform exceptionally well when the target direction is known and stationary.
However, spatially dynamic scenarios are considerably more challenging due to
time-varying spatial features and arising ambiguities, e.g. when moving
speakers cross. While in a static scenario it may be easy for a user to point
to the target's direction, manually tracking a moving speaker is impractical.
Instead of relying on accurate time-dependent directional cues, which we refer
to as strong guidance, in this paper we propose a weakly guided extraction
method solely depending on the target's initial position to cope with spatial
dynamic scenarios. By incorporating our own deep tracking algorithm and
developing a joint training strategy on a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate the
proficiency of our approach in resolving spatial ambiguities and even
outperform a mismatched, but strongly guided extraction method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自我监督学习（SSL）中新的正样本采样技术（SSPS），用于改进说话人验证（SV）。通过聚类和记忆队列选择同一说话人但不同录音条件的正样本，显著降低了说话人内部差异并提升了性能。

Motivation: 现有的SSL方法通常使用同一语句的正样本和增强数据生成说话人相同的锚点-正样本对，但这种方法主要编码了共享的录音条件信息，限制了模型对说话人身份的学习能力。

Method: 提出了自我监督正采样（SSPS）技术，利用聚类分配和正嵌入记忆队列，从潜在空间中选择同一说话人但不同录音条件的正样本。

Result: SSPS显著提升了SimCLR和DINO的性能，在VoxCeleb1-O数据集上分别达到2.57%和2.53%的EER，优于现有SSL方法。SimCLR-SSPS将EER降低58%。

Conclusion: SSPS通过优化正样本选择，有效降低了说话人内部差异，提升了说话人验证性能。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has led to considerable progress in Speaker
Verification (SV). The standard framework uses same-utterance positive sampling
and data-augmentation to generate anchor-positive pairs of the same speaker.
This is a major limitation, as this strategy primarily encodes channel
information from the recording condition, shared by the anchor and positive. We
propose a new positive sampling technique to address this bottleneck:
Self-Supervised Positive Sampling (SSPS). For a given anchor, SSPS aims to find
an appropriate positive, i.e., of the same speaker identity but a different
recording condition, in the latent space using clustering assignments and a
memory queue of positive embeddings. SSPS improves SV performance for both
SimCLR and DINO, reaching 2.57% and 2.53% EER, outperforming SOTA SSL methods
on VoxCeleb1-O. In particular, SimCLR-SSPS achieves a 58% EER reduction by
lowering intra-speaker variance, providing comparable performance to DINO-SSPS.

TL;DR: Sat2Sound是一个用于声音景观映射的多模态表示学习框架，通过结合卫星图像和声音样本预测全球声音分布。

Motivation: 现有方法依赖卫星图像和配对的音频样本，但难以捕捉声音多样性。Sat2Sound通过增强数据集和改进表示学习来克服这一限制。

Method: 利用Vision-Language Model生成语义丰富的声音景观描述，通过对比学习音频、音频描述、卫星图像及其描述，学习共享的声音景观概念库。

Result: 在GeoSound和SoundingEarth数据集上实现了跨模态检索的最先进性能，并展示了基于位置的声音景观合成新应用。

Conclusion: Sat2Sound在声音景观映射和跨模态学习方面表现优异，并为沉浸式声学体验提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present Sat2Sound, a multimodal representation learning framework for
soundscape mapping, designed to predict the distribution of sounds at any
location on Earth. Existing methods for this task rely on satellite image and
paired geotagged audio samples, which often fail to capture the diversity of
sound sources at a given location. To address this limitation, we enhance
existing datasets by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
semantically rich soundscape descriptions for locations depicted in satellite
images. Our approach incorporates contrastive learning across audio, audio
captions, satellite images, and satellite image captions. We hypothesize that
there is a fixed set of soundscape concepts shared across modalities. To this
end, we learn a shared codebook of soundscape concepts and represent each
sample as a weighted average of these concepts. Sat2Sound achieves
state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval between satellite image
and audio on two datasets: GeoSound and SoundingEarth. Additionally, building
on Sat2Sound's ability to retrieve detailed soundscape captions, we introduce a
novel application: location-based soundscape synthesis, which enables immersive
acoustic experiences. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
multi-modal tasks by effectively aligning visual and textual representations.
However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic,
leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized
domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the
adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as
an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to
create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the
general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model
key soccer concepts to then question answering tasks). The final adapted model,
trained using a curated dataset of 20k video clips, exhibits significant
improvement in soccer-specific tasks compared to the base model, with a 37.5%
relative improvement for the visual question-answering task and an accuracy
improvement from 11.8% to 63.5% for the downstream soccer action classification

Motivation: 以往的多模态LLMs方法未充分利用模型内嵌知识，导致信息冗余和效率低下，RADAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RADAR首先提取LLM与专家分类结果对齐的知识，再检索外部补充知识，最后整合两者生成报告。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR、CheXpert-Plus和IU X-ray数据集上，RADAR在语言质量和临床准确性上均优于现有LLMs。

Conclusion: RADAR通过有效整合内部和外部知识，显著提升了放射学报告生成的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches
have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their
performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval.
However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within
the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration and inefficient
utilization of learned representations. To address this limitation, we propose
RADAR, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary
knowledge injection. RADAR improves report generation by systematically
leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved
information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge
that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves
relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally,
by aggregating both sources, RADAR generates more accurate and informative
radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU
X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both

Method: 提出了包含两个子集的大规模数据集AppleGrowthVision，包括高分辨率立体图像和密集标注图像。

Result: 扩展MinneApple数据集提升了YOLOv8和Faster R-CNN的性能，同时通过VGG16等模型预测BBCH阶段准确率超过95%。

Conclusion: AppleGrowthVision填补了农业科学与计算机视觉之间的空白，为精准农业提供了强大的模型基础。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision for precision agriculture, yet
apple orchard monitoring remains limited by dataset constraints. The lack of
diverse, realistic datasets and the difficulty of annotating dense,
heterogeneous scenes. Existing datasets overlook different growth stages and
stereo imagery, both essential for realistic 3D modeling of orchards and tasks
like fruit localization, yield estimation, and structural analysis. To address
these gaps, we present AppleGrowthVision, a large-scale dataset comprising two
subsets. The first includes 9,317 high resolution stereo images collected from
a farm in Brandenburg (Germany), covering six agriculturally validated growth
stages over a full growth cycle. The second subset consists of 1,125 densely
annotated images from the same farm in Brandenburg and one in Pillnitz
(Germany), containing a total of 31,084 apple labels. AppleGrowthVision
provides stereo-image data with agriculturally validated growth stages,
enabling precise phenological analysis and 3D reconstructions. Extending
MinneApple with our data improves YOLOv8 performance by 7.69 % in terms of
F1-score, while adding it to MinneApple and MAD boosts Faster R-CNN F1-score by
31.06 %. Additionally, six BBCH stages were predicted with over 95 % accuracy
using VGG16, ResNet152, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2. AppleGrowthVision bridges
the gap between agricultural science and computer vision, by enabling the
development of robust models for fruit detection, growth modeling, and 3D
analysis in precision agriculture. Future work includes improving annotation,
enhancing 3D reconstruction, and extending multimodal analysis across all

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在日常生活中的广泛应用，对文化细微差别的准确理解变得至关重要，但现有模型在这方面表现不足。

Method: 提出RAVENEA基准，整合10,000余篇维基百科文档，训练并评估七种多模态检索器，测试其对14种先进视觉语言模型的影响。

Result: 轻量级视觉语言模型结合检索增强方法在cVQA和cIC任务中分别提升3.2%和6.2%。

Conclusion: 检索增强方法和文化包容性基准对多模态理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, the need for accurate visual culture understanding is becoming critical.
Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances
effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in
text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented
Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual
culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused
visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC).
RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia
documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and
evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the
downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen
state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented
with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by
at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the
value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for
multimodal understanding.

Motivation: 当前会话搜索方法侧重顺序建模或结构捕捉，但缺乏对两者结合的探索，且文档表示忽视了词级语义。

Method: 引入符号语法规则将会话图转为文本，结合LLMs输入；设计自监督任务（链接预测、节点生成等）增强LLMs对图结构的理解。

Result: 在AOL和Tiangong-ST数据集上验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: SGR为传统搜索策略与现代LLMs间架设了新桥梁。

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种硬件高效的量化与推理方案W4A8，通过4位整数存储权重和8位浮点运算推理，显著提升速度和内存效率，并开发了双精度量化算法以减少精度损失。

Motivation: 随着深度学习模型规模的增大，延迟和内存效率成为挑战，后训练量化成为解决方案。

Method: 提出W4A8方案和双精度量化算法(DPQ)，结合硬件优势进行量化与推理。

Result: 实验显示性能提升(吞吐量增加)，同时保持可接受的精度损失。

Conclusion: W4A8方案在速度和内存效率上表现优越，适用于现代加速器。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range
of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to speech
recognition. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, model sizes
continue to grow, posing challenges in latency and memory efficiency. To meet
these constraints, post-training quantization has emerged as a promising
solution. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-efficient quantization and
inference scheme that exploits hardware advantages with minimal accuracy
degradation. Specifically, we introduce a W4A8 scheme, where weights are
quantized and stored using 4-bit integer precision, and inference computations
are performed using 8-bit floating-point arithmetic, demonstrating significant
speedups and improved memory utilization compared to 16-bit operations,
applicable on various modern accelerators. To mitigate accuracy loss, we
develop a novel quantization algorithm, dubbed Dual Precision Quantization
(DPQ), that leverages the unique structure of our scheme without introducing
additional inference overhead. Experimental results demonstrate improved
performance (i.e., increased throughput) while maintaining tolerable accuracy
degradation relative to the full-precision model.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM聊天机器人在实时对话中何时发言的问题，提出了一个多模态模型MM-When2Speak，显著提升了响应时机预测的准确性。

Motivation: LLM聊天机器人在生成连贯回复时，常因缺乏多模态上下文而难以把握发言时机。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用从真实对话视频构建的多模态数据集，结合视觉、听觉和文本信号，提出了MM-When2Speak模型。

Result: MM-When2Speak在响应时机预测上表现优异，比现有技术提升了4倍精度。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对提升对话AI的时效性和自然性至关重要。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have demonstrated strong
capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, they
often struggle with understanding when to speak, particularly in delivering
brief, timely reactions during ongoing conversations. This limitation arises
largely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in
real-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of
response types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on
subtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we
introduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational
videos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.
This dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic
interactions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal
LLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual
context to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is
appropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x
improvement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These
results underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely,
natural, and engaging conversational AI.

Motivation: 现有的多模态模型在处理视觉嵌入的文本问题时表现不佳，需要一种新方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了GRT-SFT（引导响应触发监督微调），一种结构化微调策略，指导模型基于视觉输入进行逐步推理。

Result: GRT-SFT显著提升了模型在VoQA任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了模型在复杂多模态场景中的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: We propose Visual-only Question Answering (VoQA), a novel multimodal task in
which questions are visually embedded within images, without any accompanying
textual input. This requires models to locate, recognize, and reason over
visually embedded textual questions, posing challenges for existing large
vision-language models (LVLMs), which show notable performance drops even with
carefully designed prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce Guided Response
Triggering Supervised Fine-tuning (GRT-SFT), a structured fine-tuning strategy
that guides the model to perform step-by-step reasoning purely based on visual
input, significantly improving model performance. Our work enhances models'
capacity for human-like visual understanding in complex multimodal scenarios,
where information, including language, is perceived visually.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了通过视觉强化微调（Visual-ARFT）提升大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的多模态代理能力，并在搜索和编码任务中显著优于基线模型和GPT-4o。

Motivation: 目前开源社区在语言代理能力（如函数调用和工具集成）上取得了进展，但涉及图像思考的多模态代理能力及其基准测试仍较少探索。

Method: 提出视觉强化微调（Visual-ARFT）方法，使LVLMs能够浏览网站获取实时信息，并通过编写代码进行图像处理。同时开发多模态代理工具库（MAT）用于评估搜索和编码能力。

Result: Visual-ARFT在MAT-Coding和MAT-Search任务中分别比基线提升18.6% F1和10.3% F1，并显著超过GPT-4o。在2Wiki和HotpotQA等多跳问答基准上也有显著提升。

Conclusion: Visual-ARFT为构建鲁棒且通用性强的多模态代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: A key trend in Large Reasoning Models (e.g., OpenAI's o3) is the native
agentic ability to use external tools such as web browsers for searching and
writing/executing code for image manipulation to think with images. In the
open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in
language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration,
the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking
with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This
work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the
ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to
manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image
processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT)
with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs'
agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and
+10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT
also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks
such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.
Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building
robust and generalizable multimodal agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CP框架的方法CONSIGN，通过考虑像素间空间相关性改进图像分割中的不确定性量化。

Motivation: 现有图像分割模型生成的置信度分数缺乏严格的统计有效性，忽视了空间相关性，导致不确定性估计保守且不直观。

Method: 提出CONSIGN方法，结合空间分组分解，利用预训练分割模型生成多样本输出，实现统计有效的不确定性估计。

Result: 实验表明，CONSIGN在多个数据集和模型上显著提升性能，不确定性估计质量优于传统像素级CP方法。

Conclusion: 空间相关性是改进图像分割不确定性量化的重要因素，CONSIGN方法能够提供更具解释性的预测集。

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise
confidence scores - typically derived from softmax outputs - that represent the
model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this
information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical
imaging, these (uncalibrated) scores are heuristic in nature and do not
constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction
(CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence
scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP
directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels,
a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly
conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we
propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via
Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to
improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates
meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability
error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model
capable of generating multiple sample outputs - such as those using dropout,
Bayesian modeling, or ensembles. We evaluate CONSIGN against a standard
pixel-wise CP approach across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO
dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results
demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves
performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty
estimates.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态推测解码（MSD）方法，用于加速多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理。通过重新设计推测解码方法，解决了当前方法无法在MLLMs中实现与LLMs相同加速效果的问题。

Motivation: 当前推测解码方法在多模态大语言模型中的应用效果不佳，未能实现与纯文本模型相同的加速效果，因此需要针对多模态特性重新设计。

Method: MSD根据文本和视觉令牌的特性分别处理，并采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段训练语言建模能力，第二阶段逐步引入多模态数据增强视觉感知能力。

Result: 实验表明，MSD在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-1.5-13B上分别实现了2.29倍和2.46倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: MSD通过针对多模态特性的优化设计，显著提升了MLLMs的推理速度。

Abstract: This paper introduces Multimodal Speculative Decoding (MSD) to accelerate
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inference. Speculative decoding has
been shown to accelerate Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing
accuracy. However, current speculative decoding methods for MLLMs fail to
achieve the same speedup as they do for LLMs. To address this, we reimagine
speculative decoding specifically for MLLMs. Our analysis of MLLM
characteristics reveals two key design principles for MSD: (1) Text and visual
tokens have fundamentally different characteristics and need to be processed
separately during drafting. (2) Both language modeling ability and visual
perception capability are crucial for the draft model. For the first principle,
MSD decouples text and visual tokens in the draft model, allowing each to be
handled based on its own characteristics. For the second principle, MSD uses a
two-stage training strategy: In stage one, the draft model is trained on
text-only instruction-tuning datasets to improve its language modeling ability.
In stage two, MSD gradually introduces multimodal data to enhance the visual
perception capability of the draft model. Experiments show that MSD boosts
inference speed by up to $2.29\times$ for LLaVA-1.5-7B and up to $2.46\times$
for LLaVA-1.5-13B on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 反事实T2I在实际应用中常因缺乏概念对齐而影响生成效果，因此需要一种能够提升概念对齐的方法。

Method: 利用可控T2I模型在潜在空间中逐步替换对象，从常见场景转换为反事实场景，通过显式逻辑叙述提示（ELNP）指导替换过程，并使用DeepSeek语言模型生成指令。

Result: 实验和定性比较表明，该策略显著提升了反事实T2I中的概念对齐效果。

Conclusion: ELNP策略有效解决了反事实T2I中的概念对齐问题，为更灵活的AIGC体验提供了支持。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) has been prevalent in recent years, with most common
condition tasks having been optimized nicely. Besides, counterfactual
Text-to-Image is obstructing us from a more versatile AIGC experience. For
those scenes that are impossible to happen in real world and anti-physics, we
should spare no efforts in increasing the factual feel, which means
synthesizing images that people think very likely to be happening, and concept
alignment, which means all the required objects should be in the same frame. In
this paper, we focus on concept alignment. As controllable T2I models have
achieved satisfactory performance for real applications, we utilize this
technology to replace the objects in a synthesized image in latent space
step-by-step to change the image from a common scene to a counterfactual scene
to meet the prompt. We propose a strategy to instruct this replacing process,
which is called as Explicit Logical Narrative Prompt (ELNP), by using the newly
SoTA language model DeepSeek to generate the instructions. Furthermore, to
evaluate models' performance in counterfactual T2I, we design a metric to
calculate how many required concepts in the prompt can be covered averagely in
the synthesized images. The extensive experiments and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that our strategy can boost the concept alignment in counterfactual
T2I.

existing PGPS studies. We first categorize PGPS methods into an encoder-decoder
framework and summarize the corresponding output formats used by their encoders
and decoders. Subsequently, we classify and analyze these encoders and decoders
according to their architectural designs. Finally, we outline major challenges
and promising directions for future research. In particular, we discuss the
hallucination issues arising during the encoding phase within encoder-decoder
architectures, as well as the problem of data leakage in current PGPS
benchmarks.

Method: Vid2World通过因果化预训练视频扩散模型的架构与训练目标，实现自回归生成，并引入因果动作引导机制提升动作可控性。

Result: 实验表明，Vid2World在机器人操作和游戏模拟领域有效且可扩展。

Conclusion: Vid2World为利用视频扩散模型构建交互式世界模型提供通用方法。

Abstract: World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and
action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for
sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require
extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse
predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast,
video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that
capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a
general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion
models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs
casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its
architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation.
Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action
controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments
in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a
scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion
models to interactive world models.

Result: 生成的潜空间更结构化且可解释，同时捕获全局和类别特定因子。

Conclusion: 新方法增强了潜空间的解释性和实用性，优于现有解缠方法。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models for learning
latent representations. Standard VAEs generate dispersed and unstructured
latent spaces by utilizing all dimensions, which limits their interpretability,
especially in high-dimensional spaces. To address this challenge, Variational
Sparse Coding (VSC) introduces a spike-and-slab prior distribution, resulting
in sparse latent representations for each input. These sparse representations,
characterized by a limited number of active dimensions, are inherently more
interpretable. Despite this advantage, VSC falls short in providing structured
interpretations across samples within the same class. Intuitively, samples from
the same class are expected to share similar attributes while allowing for
variations in those attributes. This expectation should manifest as consistent
patterns of active dimensions in their latent representations, but VSC does not
enforce such consistency.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the latent space
interpretability by ensuring that the active dimensions in the latent space are
consistent across samples within the same class. To achieve this, we introduce
a new loss function that encourages samples from the same class to share
similar active dimensions. This alignment creates a more structured and
interpretable latent space, where each shared dimension corresponds to a
high-level concept, or "factor." Unlike existing disentanglement-based methods
that primarily focus on global factors shared across all classes, our method
captures both global and class-specific factors, thereby enhancing the utility
and interpretability of latent representations.

Result: 两种方法在大子采样集上表现相当，但随机采样方法在速度和内存使用上更具优势。

Conclusion: 随机采样方法能有效提升速度和内存效率，适用于3D点云实例分割。

Abstract: Recently proposed neural network architectures like PointNet [QSMG16] and
PointNet++ [QYSG17] have made it possible to apply Deep Learning to 3D point
sets. The feature representations of shapes learned by these two networks
enabled training classifiers for Semantic Segmentation, and more recently for
Instance Segmentation via the Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN)
[WYHN17]. One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors,
pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory
quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this
issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance
Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the
complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches
perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the
most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.

Abstract: Efficient creation of accurate and editable 3D CAD models is critical in
engineering design, significantly impacting cost and time-to-market in product
innovation. Current manual workflows remain highly time-consuming and demand
extensive user expertise. While recent developments in AI-driven CAD generation
show promise, existing models are limited by incomplete representations of CAD
operations, inability to generalize to real-world images, and low output
accuracy. This paper introduces CAD-Coder, an open-source Vision-Language Model
(VLM) explicitly fine-tuned to generate editable CAD code (CadQuery Python)
directly from visual input. Leveraging a novel dataset that we
created--GenCAD-Code, consisting of over 163k CAD-model image and code
pairs--CAD-Coder outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines such as GPT-4.5 and
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieving a 100% valid syntax rate and the highest accuracy in
3D solid similarity. Notably, our VLM demonstrates some signs of
generalizability, successfully generating CAD code from real-world images and
executing CAD operations unseen during fine-tuning. The performance and
adaptability of CAD-Coder highlights the potential of VLMs fine-tuned on code
to streamline CAD workflows for engineers and designers. CAD-Coder is publicly

MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch

Method: AKRMap通过构建监督投影网络，采用自适应广义核并与投影联合优化的方式，生成能捕捉复杂度量分布的交互式可视化。

Result: 定量实验表明，AKRMap在生成准确和可信度高的可视化效果上优于现有降维方法。

Conclusion: AKRMap为跨模态嵌入的可视化和文本到图像模型的比较提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However,
visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been
primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like
PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within
a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore)
across multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique
designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by
learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space.
Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a
post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized
kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach
enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex
metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom
and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that
AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and
trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in
visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models. Code

TL;DR: IndexMark是一种针对自回归图像生成模型的无训练水印框架，通过替换编码本中的冗余标记来嵌入水印，不影响图像质量，并具有高验证准确性和鲁棒性。

Motivation: 现有水印方法主要针对扩散模型，而自回归图像生成模型的水印研究不足，因此提出IndexMark以填补这一空白。

Method: 利用编码本的冗余特性，通过匹配-替换方法选择水印标记并替换，验证时计算水印标记比例，辅以索引编码器和辅助验证方案。

Result: IndexMark在图像质量、验证准确性和鲁棒性方面表现优异，能抵抗多种干扰和裁剪攻击。

Conclusion: IndexMark为自回归图像生成模型提供了一种高效、高质量的水印解决方案。

Abstract: Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent
malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative
watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while
watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely
underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for
autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy
property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with
similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in
IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully
selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and
promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby
embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark
verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in
generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder.
Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness
against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification
accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including
cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG
compression.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的认知无线电网络性能优化方法，通过能量收集和深度Q网络（DQN）策略实现次用户的数据速率最大化。

Motivation: 在认知无线电网络中，次用户在满足主用户干扰限制的同时，需要高效利用有限的能量资源以实现数据传输优化。

Method: 采用时间切换方法从主用户信号中收集能量，并结合DQN算法动态选择能量收集或数据传输，以及传输功率。

Result: 该方法在数据速率优化上优于基准策略，且表现出良好的收敛性。

Conclusion: 强化学习和能量收集的结合为认知无线电网络的性能优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to maximize the
performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN). In the presence of primary
users (PUs), it is presumed that two secondary users (SUs) access the licensed
band within underlay mode. In addition, the SU transmitter is assumed to be an
energy-constrained device that requires harvesting energy in order to transmit
signals to their intended destination. Therefore, we propose that there are two
main sources of energy; the interference of PUs' transmissions and ambient
radio frequency (RF) sources. The SU will select whether to gather energy from
PUs or only from ambient sources based on a predetermined threshold. The
process of energy harvesting from the PUs' messages is accomplished via the
time switching approach. In addition, based on a deep Q-network (DQN) approach,
the SU transmitter determines whether to collect energy or transmit messages
during each time slot as well as selects the suitable transmission power in
order to maximize its average data rate. Our approach outperforms a baseline
strategy and converges, as shown by our findings.

TL;DR: 提出了CIM-Explorer工具包，用于优化基于RRAM交叉阵列的二进制和三元神经网络推理，支持从设计空间探索到编译的全流程。

Motivation: 为解决现有软件工具在RRAM计算内存架构中仅关注单一环节（如编译或模拟）且依赖传统8位量化的问题。

Method: 开发了CIM-Explorer，包含端到端编译器堆栈、多种映射选项和模拟器，支持设计空间探索以评估不同交叉阵列参数和映射的准确性。

Result: 通过案例研究展示了不同映射和交叉阵列参数的预期准确性。

Conclusion: CIM-Explorer为从早期准确性评估到最终芯片实现的整个设计过程提供了全面支持。

Abstract: Using Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) crossbars in Computing-in-Memory
(CIM) architectures offers a promising solution to overcome the von Neumann
bottleneck. Due to non-idealities like cell variability, RRAM crossbars are
often operated in binary mode, utilizing only two states: Low Resistive State
(LRS) and High Resistive State (HRS). Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) and Ternary
Neural Networks (TNNs) are well-suited for this hardware due to their efficient
mapping. Existing software projects for RRAM-based CIM typically focus on only
one aspect: compilation, simulation, or Design Space Exploration (DSE).
Moreover, they often rely on classical 8 bit quantization. To address these
limitations, we introduce CIM-Explorer, a modular toolkit for optimizing BNN
and TNN inference on RRAM crossbars. CIM-Explorer includes an end-to-end
compiler stack, multiple mapping options, and simulators, enabling a DSE flow
for accuracy estimation across different crossbar parameters and mappings.
CIM-Explorer can accompany the entire design process, from early accuracy
estimation for specific crossbar parameters, to selecting an appropriate
mapping, and compiling BNNs and TNNs for a finalized crossbar chip. In DSE case
studies, we demonstrate the expected accuracy for various mappings and crossbar
parameters. CIM-Explorer can be found on GitHub.

Motivation: 解决数据稀缺性和异构性问题，避免数据共享带来的隐私和技术障碍。

Method: 基于 gRPC 实现统一通信栈，支持集中式和完全分布式的联邦学习策略。

Result: FedKBP+ 在三个预测任务中表现出高效、稳健的潜力。

Conclusion: FedKBP+ 是一个有效的联邦学习平台，适用于放射治疗。

Abstract: Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and
consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by
the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among
institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could
alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns
about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work
aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated
learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in
radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified
communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support
communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or
distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the
centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source
frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where
participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer
communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using
scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our
results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust,
showing great potential as a federated learning platform for radiation therapy.

Method: 利用随机纽结设计曲面，开发非欧几里得统计采样方法，并改进 PointNet 和 Transformer 架构以结合拓扑信息。

Result: 通过结合拓扑信息，深度学习模型在 EuLearn 数据集上的性能显著提高。

Conclusion: 将拓扑信息整合到深度学习流程中可以解决复杂拓扑数据集的分类问题。

Abstract: We present EuLearn, the first surface datasets equitably representing a
diversity of topological types. We designed our embedded surfaces of uniformly
varying genera relying on random knots, thus allowing our surfaces to knot with
themselves. EuLearn contributes new topological datasets of meshes, point
clouds, and scalar fields in 3D. We aim to facilitate the training of machine
learning systems that can discern topological features. We experimented with
specific emblematic 3D neural network architectures, finding that their vanilla
implementations perform poorly on genus classification. To enhance performance,
we developed a novel, non-Euclidean, statistical sampling method adapted to
graph and manifold data. We also introduce adjacency-informed adaptations of
PointNet and Transformer architectures that rely on our non-Euclidean sampling
strategy. Our results demonstrate that incorporating topological information
into deep learning workflows significantly improves performance on these
otherwise challenging EuLearn datasets.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models and Large Language Models (LLMs), Euclidean
space is the de facto geometric setting of our machine learning architectures.
However, recent literature has demonstrated that this choice comes with
fundamental limitations. To that end, non-Euclidean learning is quickly gaining
traction, particularly in web-related applications where complex relationships
and structures are prevalent. Non-Euclidean spaces, such as hyperbolic,
spherical, and mixed-curvature spaces, have been shown to provide more
efficient and effective representations for data with intrinsic geometric
properties, including web-related data like social network topology,
query-document relationships, and user-item interactions. Integrating
foundation models with non-Euclidean geometries has great potential to enhance
their ability to capture and model the underlying structures, leading to better
performance in search, recommendations, and content understanding. This
workshop focuses on the intersection of Non-Euclidean Foundation Models and
Geometric Learning (NEGEL), exploring its potential benefits, including the
potential benefits for advancing web-related technologies, challenges, and
future directions. Workshop page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合聚类和注意力机制的GRU模型（CAGRU），用于预测客户购买意向，特别关注了客户群的分布不平衡问题。

Motivation: 预测客户是否重复购买是商业策略的关键，但目前研究多关注购买产品类型，而忽视了客户群的分布不平衡问题。

Method: 通过多模态数据，先聚类客户群，再用GRU提取时间序列特征，并引入注意力机制。针对不同客户群单独训练模型。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，CAGRU方法表现优越。

Conclusion: CAGRU能有效捕捉不同客户群的行为差异，解决了客户群不平衡问题。

Abstract: Accurately predicting customers' purchase intentions is critical to the
success of a business strategy. Current researches mainly focus on analyzing
the specific types of products that customers are likely to purchase in the
future, little attention has been paid to the critical factor of whether
customers will engage in repurchase behavior. Predicting whether a customer
will make the next purchase is a classic time series forecasting task. However,
in real-world purchasing behavior, customer groups typically exhibit imbalance
- i.e., there are a large number of occasional buyers and a small number of
loyal customers. This head-to-tail distribution makes traditional time series
forecasting methods face certain limitations when dealing with such problems.
To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a unified Clustering and
Attention mechanism GRU model (CAGRU) that leverages multi-modal data for
customer purchase intention prediction. The framework first performs customer
profiling with respect to the customer characteristics and clusters the
customers to delineate the different customer clusters that contain similar
features. Then, the time series features of different customer clusters are
extracted by GRU neural network and an attention mechanism is introduced to
capture the significance of sequence locations. Furthermore, to mitigate the
head-to-tail distribution of customer segments, we train the model separately
for each customer segment, to adapt and capture more accurately the differences
in behavioral characteristics between different customer segments, as well as
the similar characteristics of the customers within the same customer segment.
We constructed four datasets and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed CAGRU approach.

TL;DR: PandaGuard是一个统一的模块化框架，用于评估和提升大语言模型的安全性，通过多智能体系统模拟攻击、防御和裁判，揭示了模型漏洞和防御策略的局限性。

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）易受对抗性提示攻击（jailbreaks），现有评估方法分散且缺乏系统性，亟需统一的框架进行可复现分析。

Method: 提出PandaGuard框架，包含19种攻击方法、12种防御机制及多种裁判策略；开发PandaBench基准，评估49个LLM的攻击/防御交互。

Result: 发现防御策略无最优解，裁判分歧导致安全评估差异显著，提供了透明可复现的研究成果。

Conclusion: PandaGuard为LLM安全研究提供了系统化工具，揭示了安全评估的复杂性和多维度挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain
vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety
alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety
research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack
or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this
work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM
jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and
judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms,
along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin
architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and
configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and
practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these
attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches,
requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals
key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs,
and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all
dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety
assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to
support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

multimodal data presents unique challenges. We provide the first systematic
analysis of MRAG privacy vulnerabilities across vision-language and
speech-language modalities. Using a novel compositional structured prompt
attack in a black-box setting, we demonstrate how attackers can extract private
information by manipulating queries. Our experiments reveal that LMMs can both
directly generate outputs resembling retrieved content and produce descriptions
that indirectly expose sensitive information, highlighting the urgent need for
robust privacy-preserving MRAG techniques.

Method: 通过提出攻击成功概率（ASP）作为新指标，并结合催眠攻击和忽略前缀攻击，对14种开源LLM进行了全面测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，催眠攻击成功率达到90%，而忽略前缀攻击可突破所有14种模型，ASP超过60%。发现越知名的模型越容易受到攻击。

Conclusion: 开源LLM对提示注入攻击高度脆弱，需提高公众意识并开发有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable
to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive
information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for
these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against
the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks.
Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack
Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response,
reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the
effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective
hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models,
including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable
behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore
prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over
$60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known
LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the
need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: TraMark为解决联邦学习系统中的模型泄露问题提供了一种有效的黑盒水印注入方法。

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of Federated Learning (FL) systems, each local
client has access to the global model, posing a critical risk of model leakage.
Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable
intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on
non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a
gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box
watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks
into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting
traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a
novel server-side watermarking method, $\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a
traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model
leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions
the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and
the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is
constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while
preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark
exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset
before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL
systems demonstrate that $\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all
watermarked models while preserving their main task performance.

Motivation: 经典方法如DP-FedAvg在客户端隐私要求异构时性能下降，现有方法缺乏理论支持且假设服务器可信。本文提出新方法，在不信任环境下提升性能。

Method: 提出GDPFed，按隐私预算分组实现客户端级差分隐私；GDPFed⁺增加模型稀疏化并优化采样比例。

Result: 实验表明GDPFed⁺在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GDPFed⁺有效减少隐私预算浪费并提升模型效用，适用于不信任环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning with client-level differential privacy (DP) provides a
promising framework for collaboratively training models while rigorously
protecting clients' privacy. However, classic approaches like DP-FedAvg
struggle when clients have heterogeneous privacy requirements, as they must
uniformly enforce the strictest privacy level across clients, leading to
excessive DP noise and significant model utility degradation. Existing methods
to improve the model utility in such heterogeneous privacy settings often
assume a trusted server and are largely heuristic, resulting in suboptimal
performance and lacking strong theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we
address these challenges under a practical attack model where both clients and
the server are honest-but-curious. We propose GDPFed, which partitions clients
into groups based on their privacy budgets and achieves client-level DP within
each group to reduce the privacy budget waste and hence improve the model
utility. Based on the privacy and convergence analysis of GDPFed, we find that
the magnitude of DP noise depends on both model dimensionality and the
per-group client sampling ratios. To further improve the performance of GDPFed,
we introduce GDPFed$^+$, which integrates model sparsification to eliminate
unnecessary noise and optimizes per-group client sampling ratios to minimize
convergence error. Extensive empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GDPFed$^+$, showing substantial
performance gains compared with state-of-the-art methods.

that advanced text jailbreak attacks cannot be easily ported to end-to-end
LALMs via text-to speech (TTS) techniques. We then propose AudioJailbreak, a
novel audio jailbreak attack, featuring (1) asynchrony: the jailbreak audio
does not need to align with user prompts in the time axis by crafting suffixal
jailbreak audios; (2) universality: a single jailbreak perturbation is
effective for different prompts by incorporating multiple prompts into
perturbation generation; (3) stealthiness: the malicious intent of jailbreak
audios will not raise the awareness of victims by proposing various intent
concealment strategies; and (4) over-the-air robustness: the jailbreak audios
remain effective when being played over the air by incorporating the
reverberation distortion effect with room impulse response into the generation
of the perturbations. In contrast, all prior audio jailbreak attacks cannot
offer asynchrony, universality, stealthiness, or over-the-air robustness.
Moreover, AudioJailbreak is also applicable to the adversary who cannot fully
manipulate user prompts, thus has a much broader attack scenario. Extensive
experiments with thus far the most LALMs demonstrate the high effectiveness of
AudioJailbreak. We highlight that our work peeks into the security implications
of audio jailbreak attacks against LALMs, and realistically fosters improving
their security robustness. The implementation and audio samples are available
at our website https://audiojailbreak.github.io/AudioJailbreak.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICE的新型黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过意图隐藏和分散技术高效绕过LLMs的安全限制，并在单一查询中实现高攻击成功率。同时构建了BiSceneEval数据集，用于评估LLMs在问答和文本生成任务中的鲁棒性。

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全性仍存在重大隐患，尤其是越狱攻击。现有方法存在迭代查询过多和跨模型泛化能力差的问题，且当前的评估数据集主要关注问答场景，缺乏对文本生成任务的关注。

Method: 提出ICE方法，利用意图隐藏和分散策略绕过LLMs的安全约束；构建BiSceneEval数据集，涵盖问答和文本生成任务，评估模型鲁棒性。

Result: ICE在单一查询中实现了高攻击成功率，显著提升效率和跨模型适用性；BiSceneEval数据集展示了LLMs在两种任务中的漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前防御机制的关键漏洞，强调需要结合预设安全机制和实时语义分解的混合安全策略来增强LLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements,
their security remains a pressing concern. One major threat is jailbreak
attacks, where adversarial prompts bypass model safeguards to generate harmful
or objectionable content. Researchers study jailbreak attacks to understand
security and robustness of LLMs. However, existing jailbreak attack methods
face two main challenges: (1) an excessive number of iterative queries, and (2)
poor generalization across models. In addition, recent jailbreak evaluation
datasets focus primarily on question-answering scenarios, lacking attention to
text generation tasks that require accurate regeneration of toxic content. To
tackle these challenges, we propose two contributions: (1) ICE, a novel
black-box jailbreak method that employs Intent Concealment and divErsion to
effectively circumvent security constraints. ICE achieves high attack success
rates (ASR) with a single query, significantly improving efficiency and
transferability across different models. (2) BiSceneEval, a comprehensive
dataset designed for assessing LLM robustness in question-answering and
text-generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ICE outperforms
existing jailbreak techniques, revealing critical vulnerabilities in current
defense mechanisms. Our findings underscore the necessity of a hybrid security
strategy that integrates predefined security mechanisms with real-time semantic
decomposition to enhance the security of LLMs.

TL;DR: 训练数据重构攻击允许攻击者恢复模型的部分训练数据。本文研究了在小数据集情况下，即使使用差分隐私防御，攻击者仍能成功重构数据。

Motivation: 研究在实际威胁模型中（攻击者仅知道训练数据的分布），对小数据集进行迁移学习的神经网络是否易受训练数据重构攻击。

Method: 通过重构神经网络对迁移学习的神经网络分类器进行攻击，并使用Neyman-Pearson准则评估重构效果。

Result: 攻击在小数据集情况下有效，且差分隐私防御会严重降低分类器准确性。

Conclusion: 迁移学习分类器在小数据集情况下存在训练数据保护风险。

Abstract: Training data reconstruction attacks enable adversaries to recover portions
of a released model's training data. We consider the attacks where a
reconstructor neural network learns to invert the (random) mapping between
training data and model weights. Prior work has shown that an informed
adversary with access to released model's weights and all but one training data
point can achieve high-quality reconstructions in this way. However,
differential privacy can defend against such an attack with little to no loss
in model's utility when the amount of training data is sufficiently large. In
this work we consider a more realistic adversary who only knows the
distribution from which a small training dataset has been sampled and who
attacks a transfer-learned neural network classifier that has been trained on
this dataset. We exhibit an attack that works in this realistic threat model
and demonstrate that in the small-data regime it cannot be defended against by
DP-SGD without severely damaging the classifier accuracy. This raises
significant concerns about the use of such transfer-learned classifiers when
protection of training-data is paramount. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of our attack on VGG, EfficientNet and ResNet image classifiers
transfer-learned on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CelebA respectively. Additionally, we
point out that the commonly used (true-positive) reconstruction success rate
metric fails to reliably quantify the actual reconstruction effectiveness.
Instead, we make use of the Neyman-Pearson lemma to construct the receiver
operating characteristic curve and consider the associated true-positive
reconstruction rate at a fixed level of the false-positive reconstruction rate.

Motivation: 挑战当前LLM在隐私任务中可靠检测PII的假设，揭示模糊人名检测的失败现象。

Method: 提出AMBENCH数据集，测试LLM在模糊人名检测中的表现，并与专用工具对比。

Result: 模糊人名的召回率下降20-40%，且在隐私保护摘要中更易被忽略。

Conclusion: LLM单独用于隐私保护存在风险，需系统性研究其失败模式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to protect sensitive
user data. However, current LLM-based privacy solutions assume that these
models can reliably detect personally identifiable information (PII),
particularly named entities. In this paper, we challenge that assumption by
revealing systematic failures in LLM-based privacy tasks. Specifically, we show
that modern LLMs regularly overlook human names even in short text snippets due
to ambiguous contexts, which cause the names to be misinterpreted or
mishandled. We propose AMBENCH, a benchmark dataset of seemingly ambiguous
human names, leveraging the name regularity bias phenomenon, embedded within
concise text snippets along with benign prompt injections. Our experiments on
modern LLMs tasked to detect PII as well as specialized tools show that recall
of ambiguous names drops by 20--40% compared to more recognizable names.
Furthermore, ambiguous human names are four times more likely to be ignored in
supposedly privacy-preserving summaries generated by LLMs when benign prompt
injections are present. These findings highlight the underexplored risks of
relying solely on LLMs to safeguard user privacy and underscore the need for a
more systematic investigation into their privacy failure modes.

Method: 采用自适应攻击技术的对抗评估框架，持续测试Gemini模型的不同版本。

Result: 测试帮助提升了Gemini抵御恶意操纵的能力。

Conclusion: 持续对抗评估是增强模型安全性的有效手段。

Abstract: Gemini is increasingly used to perform tasks on behalf of users, where
function-calling and tool-use capabilities enable the model to access user
data. Some tools, however, require access to untrusted data introducing risk.
Adversaries can embed malicious instructions in untrusted data which cause the
model to deviate from the user's expectations and mishandle their data or
permissions. In this report, we set out Google DeepMind's approach to
evaluating the adversarial robustness of Gemini models and describe the main
lessons learned from the process. We test how Gemini performs against a
sophisticated adversary through an adversarial evaluation framework, which
deploys a suite of adaptive attack techniques to run continuously against past,
current, and future versions of Gemini. We describe how these ongoing
evaluations directly help make Gemini more resilient against manipulation.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了通过结构化LLM上下文调节（基于PWP原则）来改进通用LLM在科学文档中的错误检测能力，初步结果显示该方法能提升文本和图像错误的识别效果。

Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂科学文档中因固有纠错倾向而掩盖错误的问题，提高其精确验证的可靠性。

Method: 采用PWP原则的结构化上下文调节策略，测试了Gemini 2.5 Pro和ChatGPT Plus o3在化学公式验证中的表现。

Result: PWP方法改善了文本错误识别，Gemini 2.5 Pro成功检测到图像公式错误，而ChatGPT Plus o3未能实现。

Conclusion: PWP上下文调节是一种有潜力提升LLM在科学文档中细节错误检测能力的可行方法，需进一步验证。

Abstract: Identifying subtle technical errors within complex scientific and technical
documents, especially those requiring multimodal interpretation (e.g., formulas
in images), presents a significant hurdle for Large Language Models (LLMs)
whose inherent error-correction tendencies can mask inaccuracies. This
exploratory proof-of-concept (PoC) study investigates structured LLM context
conditioning, informed by Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) principles, as a
methodological strategy to modulate this LLM behavior at inference time. The
approach is designed to enhance the reliability of readily available,
general-purpose LLMs (specifically Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3) for
precise validation tasks, crucially relying only on their standard chat
interfaces without API access or model modifications. To explore this
methodology, we focused on validating chemical formulas within a single,
complex test paper with known textual and image-based errors. Several prompting
strategies were evaluated: while basic prompts proved unreliable, an approach
adapting PWP structures to rigorously condition the LLM's analytical mindset
appeared to improve textual error identification with both models. Notably,
this method also guided Gemini 2.5 Pro to repeatedly identify a subtle
image-based formula error previously overlooked during manual review, a task
where ChatGPT Plus o3 failed in our tests. These preliminary findings highlight
specific LLM operational modes that impede detail-oriented validation and
suggest that PWP-informed context conditioning offers a promising and highly
accessible technique for developing more robust LLM-driven analytical
workflows, particularly for tasks requiring meticulous error detection in
scientific and technical documents. Extensive validation beyond this limited
PoC is necessary to ascertain broader applicability.

Method: 通过模拟反映现实贷款模式的合成数据，量化不同公平干预对利润和违约率的影响。

Result: 忽略保护属性的方法在公平性和盈利性上均优于显式公平干预，并识别了公平贷款盈利的具体条件。

Conclusion: 提供了设计平衡伦理与业务目标的贷款算法的实用指导。

Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models to
automate lending decisions, concerns about algorithmic fairness have risen.
This paper explores the tradeoff between enforcing fairness constraints (such
as demographic parity or equal opportunity) and maximizing lender
profitability. Through simulations on synthetic data that reflects real-world
lending patterns, we quantify how different fairness interventions impact
profit margins and default rates. Our results demonstrate that equal
opportunity constraints typically impose lower profit costs than demographic
parity, but surprisingly, removing protected attributes from the model
(fairness through unawareness) outperforms explicit fairness interventions in
both fairness and profitability metrics. We further identify the specific
economic conditions under which fair lending becomes profitable and analyze the
feature-specific drivers of unfairness. These findings offer practical guidance
for designing lending algorithms that balance ethical considerations with
business objectives.

Motivation: 研究LLM的价值差异需要更动态和区分度高的评估方法，以解决当前数据集的通用性和过时性问题。

Method: 提出AdAEM框架，通过自适应生成测试问题，基于信息论目标优化，提取最新或有文化争议的主题。

Result: 生成12,310个基于Schwartz价值理论的问题，分析16个LLM的价值差异，验证方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AdAEM能够动态跟踪LLM的价值变化，为价值研究提供更全面的工具。

Abstract: Assessing Large Language Models (LLMs)' underlying value differences enables
comprehensive comparison of their misalignment, cultural adaptability, and
biases. Nevertheless, current value measurement datasets face the
informativeness challenge: with often outdated, contaminated, or generic test
questions, they can only capture the shared value orientations among different
LLMs, leading to saturated and thus uninformative results. To address this
problem, we introduce AdAEM, a novel, self-extensible assessment framework for
revealing LLMs' inclinations. Distinct from previous static benchmarks, AdAEM
can automatically and adaptively generate and extend its test questions. This
is achieved by probing the internal value boundaries of a diverse set of LLMs
developed across cultures and time periods in an in-context optimization
manner. The optimization process theoretically maximizes an
information-theoretic objective to extract the latest or culturally
controversial topics, providing more distinguishable and informative insights
about models' value differences. In this way, AdAEM is able to co-evolve with
the development of LLMs, consistently tracking their value dynamics. Using
AdAEM, we generate 12,310 questions grounded in Schwartz Value Theory, conduct
an extensive analysis to manifest our method's validity and effectiveness, and
benchmark the values of 16 LLMs, laying the groundwork for better value
research.

Conclusion: 本文通过整合民主理论和实践治理工具，为学者、政策制定者和技术人员提供了一个行动框架，以弥合伦理目标与操作现实之间的差距。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses both significant risks and valuable
opportunities for democratic governance. This paper introduces a dual taxonomy
to evaluate AI's complex relationship with democracy: the AI Risks to Democracy
(AIRD) taxonomy, which identifies how AI can undermine core democratic
principles such as autonomy, fairness, and trust; and the AI's Positive
Contributions to Democracy (AIPD) taxonomy, which highlights AI's potential to
enhance transparency, participation, efficiency, and evidence-based
policymaking.
  Grounded in the European Union's approach to ethical AI governance, and
particularly the seven Trustworthy AI requirements proposed by the European
Commission's High-Level Expert Group on AI, each identified risk is aligned
with mitigation strategies based on EU regulatory and normative frameworks. Our
analysis underscores the transversal importance of transparency and societal
well-being across all risk categories and offers a structured lens for aligning
AI systems with democratic values.
  By integrating democratic theory with practical governance tools, this paper
offers a normative and actionable framework to guide research, regulation, and
institutional design to support trustworthy, democratic AI. It provides
scholars with a conceptual foundation to evaluate the democratic implications
of AI, equips policymakers with structured criteria for ethical oversight, and
helps technologists align system design with democratic principles. In doing
so, it bridges the gap between ethical aspirations and operational realities,
laying the groundwork for more inclusive, accountable, and resilient democratic
systems in the algorithmic age.

Abstract: Algorithmic bias has been the subject of much recent controversy. To clarify
what is at stake and to make progress resolving the controversy, a better
understanding of the concepts involved would be helpful. The discussion here
focuses on the disputed claim that algorithms themselves cannot be biased. To
clarify this claim we need to know what kind of thing 'algorithms themselves'
are, and to disambiguate the several meanings of 'bias' at play. This further
involves showing how bias of moral import can result from statistical biases,
and drawing connections to previous conceptual work about political artifacts
and oppressive things. Data bias has been identified in domains like hiring,
policing and medicine. Examples where algorithms themselves have been
pinpointed as the locus of bias include recommender systems that influence
media consumption, academic search engines that influence citation patterns,
and the 2020 UK algorithmically-moderated A-level grades. Recognition that
algorithms are a kind of thing that can be biased is key to making decisions
about responsibility for harm, and preventing algorithmically mediated
discrimination.

Abstract: Voting methods are instrumental design element of democracies. Citizens use
them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision.
However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to
people's voting choices. Despite the significance and inter-disciplinary
scientific progress on voting methods, several democracies keep relying on
outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well,
while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade
real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods
such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a
proportional representation of voters' preferences. By rigorously assessing a
new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland,
we unravel the striking voting outcomes of fair voting methods: more winning
projects with the same budget and broader geographic and preference
representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters
who used to be under-represented, while promoting novel project ideas. We
provide profound causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional
voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very
technical specialized explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic
values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism
and compromise. These findings come with a global momentum to unleash a new and
long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies.

with AI. We administered validated, psychometric sustainability-related
questionnaires - each 100 times per model -- to capture response patterns and
variability. Our findings revealed significant inter-model differences: For
example, GPT exhibited skepticism about the compatibility of AI and
sustainability, whereas LLaMA demonstrated extreme techno-optimism with perfect
scores for several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Models also diverged
in attributing institutional responsibility for AI and sustainability
integration, a results that holds implications for technology governance
approaches. Our results demonstrate that model selection could substantially
influence organizational sustainability strategies, highlighting the need for
awareness of model-specific biases when deploying LLMs for
sustainability-related decision-making.

TL;DR: ThermoONet是一种基于机器学习的神经网络，用于预测彗星温度和冰升华通量，显著降低计算成本，并成功应用于彗星67P和21P的水活动建模。

Motivation: 传统数值方法在彗星热物理模型研究中计算成本高昂，限制了高分辨率或重复建模的需求。

Method: 采用机器学习方法开发ThermoONet神经网络，预测彗星温度和冰升华通量，并与数值模拟结果对比。

Conclusion: ThermoONet高效且有效，结合全局优化算法可反推目标天体的物理性质。

Abstract: Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical
models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional
numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally
intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or
repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning
approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the
temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations
indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature
of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing
computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to
model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and
21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves
of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope,
respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency.
Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet
proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.

Conclusion: 提出的分层学习与仿真验证方法有效提升了LLMs在复杂规划任务中的表现，且能构建高质量的领域模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable planning from natural language
instructions using implicit world knowledge, but often produce flawed plans
that require refinement. Instead of directly predicting plans, recent methods
aim to learn a problem domain that can be solved for different goal states
using classical planners. However, these approaches require significant human
feedback to obtain useful models. We address this shortcoming by learning
hierarchical domains, where low-level predicates and actions are composed into
higher-level counterparts, and by leveraging simulation to validate their
preconditions and effects. This hierarchical approach is particularly powerful
for long-horizon planning, where LLM-based planning approaches typically

consistency among the different planning levels. Evaluation on two challenging
International Planning Competition (IPC) domains and a long-horizon robot

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的安全导向训练技术HPI，结合DSAC算法开发了DSAC-H，在自动驾驶系统中实现了高效驾驶与安全约束的平衡。

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法在应对约束条件时存在挑战，尤其在现实应用中。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HPI技术，计算高效驾驶与安全约束的策略梯度，生成谐波梯度以减少冲突，结合DSAC算法形成DSAC-H。

Result: 多车道场景模拟显示DSAC-H实现了高效驾驶，且安全违规接近零。

Conclusion: DSAC-H在自动驾驶系统中成功平衡了效率与安全性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), known for its self-evolution capability, offers
a promising approach to training high-level autonomous driving systems.
However, handling constraints remains a significant challenge for existing RL
algorithms, particularly in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose
a new safety-oriented training technique called harmonic policy iteration
(HPI). At each RL iteration, it first calculates two policy gradients
associated with efficient driving and safety constraints, respectively. Then, a
harmonic gradient is derived for policy updating, minimizing conflicts between
the two gradients and consequently enabling a more balanced and stable training
process. Furthermore, we adopt the state-of-the-art DSAC algorithm as the
backbone and integrate it with our HPI to develop a new safe RL algorithm,
DSAC-H. Extensive simulations in multi-lane scenarios demonstrate that DSAC-H
achieves efficient driving performance with near-zero safety constraint
violations.

TL;DR: 提出SayCoNav方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）为机器人团队自动生成协作策略，提升多目标导航任务效率。

Motivation: 在未知环境中完成复杂导航任务需要机器人团队的自适应协作。

Method: SayCoNav通过LLM生成协作策略，并以分散式为每个机器人生成计划和行动，同时通过信息共享不断更新计划。

Result: 在MultiON任务中，SayCoNav比基线方法提升效率最高44.28%，并能动态适应变化条件。

Conclusion: SayCoNav通过LLM驱动的协作策略显著提升了机器人团队的导航效率和适应性。

Abstract: Adaptive collaboration is critical to a team of autonomous robots to perform
complicated navigation tasks in large-scale unknown environments. An effective
collaboration strategy should be determined and adapted according to each
robot's skills and current status to successfully achieve the shared goal. We
present SayCoNav, a new approach that leverages large language models (LLMs)
for automatically generating this collaboration strategy among a team of
robots. Building on the collaboration strategy, each robot uses the LLM to
generate its plans and actions in a decentralized way. By sharing information
to each other during navigation, each robot also continuously updates its
step-by-step plans accordingly. We evaluate SayCoNav on Multi-Object Navigation
(MultiON) tasks, that require the team of the robots to utilize their
complementary strengths to efficiently search multiple different objects in
unknown environments. By validating SayCoNav with varied team compositions and
conditions against baseline methods, our experimental results show that
SayCoNav can improve search efficiency by at most 44.28% through effective
collaboration among heterogeneous robots. It can also dynamically adapt to the
changing conditions during task execution.

Conclusion: 分层MARL框架有效实现了四足机器人在复杂协作任务中的自主性，展示了在真实环境中的可行性和灵活性。

Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained
locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer
offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive,
and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully
autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly
dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball
manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a
high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal
Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning
framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise
to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception,
and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed
learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive
multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped
robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization,
with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human
soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.

Result: 实际测试表明，GUIDE显著优于缺乏任务特定不确定性感知的方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE框架为机器人在复杂环境中的导航提供了一种高效的任务特定不确定性管理解决方案。

Abstract: Robots navigating complex environments must manage uncertainty from sensor
noise, environmental changes, and incomplete information, with different tasks
requiring varying levels of precision in different areas. For example, precise
localization may be crucial near obstacles but less critical in open spaces. We
present GUIDE (Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and
Execution), a framework that integrates these task-specific requirements into
navigation policies via Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs). By assigning
acceptable uncertainty levels to different locations, TSUMs enable robots to
adapt uncertainty management based on context. When combined with reinforcement
learning, GUIDE learns policies that balance task completion and uncertainty
management without extensive reward engineering. Real-world tests show
significant performance gains over methods lacking task-specific uncertainty
awareness.

Method: 提出Safety2Drive，覆盖70项标准测试、支持安全威胁注入和多维评估。

Result: Safety2Drive提供从场景构建到验证的标准化测试框架。

Conclusion: Safety2Drive为自动驾驶安全部署建立了标准化测试范式。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems demand the high levels of safety assurance.
Despite significant advancements in AD demonstrated on open-source benchmarks
like Longest6 and Bench2Drive, existing datasets still lack
regulatory-compliant scenario libraries for closed-loop testing to
comprehensively evaluate the functional safety of AD. Meanwhile, real-world AD
accidents are underrepresented in current driving datasets. This scarcity leads
to inadequate evaluation of AD performance, posing risks to safety validation
and practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose Safety2Drive,
a safety-critical scenario library designed to evaluate AD systems.
Safety2Drive offers three key contributions. (1) Safety2Drive comprehensively
covers the test items required by standard regulations and contains 70 AD
function test items. (2) Safety2Drive supports the safety-critical scenario
generalization. It has the ability to inject safety threats such as natural
environment corruptions and adversarial attacks cross camera and LiDAR sensors.
(3) Safety2Drive supports multi-dimensional evaluation. In addition to the
evaluation of AD systems, it also supports the evaluation of various perception
tasks, such as object detection and lane detection. Safety2Drive provides a
paradigm from scenario construction to validation, establishing a standardized
test framework for the safe deployment of AD.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning
capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling.
Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or
adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to
capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting
their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory
Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven
foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to
identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment,
providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX
provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions,
allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather
than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to
assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning
Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris,
evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making
performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance,
assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility
analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models,
demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap
between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution. The source

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种广义替代安全度量（GSSM），通过无监督学习自然驾驶数据来量化交通交互中的碰撞风险，优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注稀疏风险数据，且难以适应不同交互场景，因此需要一种无需标签、上下文自适应的安全评估方法。

Method: 利用神经网络学习正常驾驶行为的上下文条件分布，通过极值理论计算基于多向间距的风险评分。

Result: GSSM在真实碰撞测试中表现优异（AUPRC达0.9），可提前2.6秒预警，且在不同交互场景中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GSSM为可扩展、上下文感知的碰撞风险评估提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Accurate and timely alerts for drivers or automated systems to unfolding
collisions remains a challenge in road safety, particularly in highly
interactive urban traffic. Existing approaches require labour-intensive
annotation of sparse risk, struggle to consider varying interaction context, or
are useful only in the scenarios they are designed for. To address these
limits, this study introduces the generalised surrogate safety measure (GSSM),
a new approach that learns exclusively from naturalistic driving without crash
or risk labels. GSSM captures the patterns of normal driving and estimates the
extent to which a traffic interaction deviates from the norm towards unsafe
extreme. Utilising neural networks, normal interactions are characterised by
context-conditioned distributions of multi-directional spacing between road
users. In the same interaction context, a spacing closer than normal entails
higher risk of potential collision. Then a context-adaptive risk score and its
associated probability can be calculated based on the theory of extreme values.
Any measurable factors, such as motion kinematics, weather, lighting, can serve
as part of the context, allowing for diverse coverage of safety-critical
interactions. Multiple public driving datasets are used to train GSSMs, which
are tested with 4,875 real-world crashes and near-crashes reconstructed from
the SHRP2 NDS. A vanilla GSSM using only instantaneous states achieves AUPRC of
0.9 and secures a median time advance of 2.6 seconds to prevent potential
collisions. Additional data and contextual factors provide further performance
gains. Across various interaction types such as rear-end, merging, and
crossing, the accuracy and timeliness of GSSM consistently outperforms existing
baselines. GSSM therefore establishes a scalable, context-aware, and
generalisable foundation to proactively quantify collision risk in traffic
interactions.

Motivation: 现有模型多关注形状预测而忽略接触和张力约束，可能导致物体和机器人受损，因此需要更安全的操作方法。

Method: 使用预测模型联合估计形状和张力，结合基于多项式区间的实时轨迹优化器，强制执行安全约束。

Result: 在模拟线束装配任务中，比现有方法更高的成功率且无安全违规。

Conclusion: 该方法在接触丰富的环境中实现了稳健且安全的可变形线性物体操作。

Abstract: Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) is challenging due to their
complex dynamics and the need for safe interaction in contact-rich
environments. Most existing models focus on shape prediction alone and fail to
account for contact and tension constraints, which can lead to damage to both
the DLO and the robot. In this work, we propose a certifiably safe motion
planning and control framework for DLO manipulation. At the core of our method
is a predictive model that jointly estimates the DLO's future shape and
tension. These predictions are integrated into a real-time trajectory optimizer
based on polynomial zonotopes, allowing us to enforce safety constraints
throughout the execution. We evaluate our framework on a simulated wire harness
assembly task using a 7-DOF robotic arm. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
our approach achieves a higher task success rate while avoiding all safety
violations. The results demonstrate that our method enables robust and safe DLO
manipulation in contact-rich environments.

Conclusion: TR-DRL有效利用了时间反转对称性，为深度强化学习在机器人任务中的应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Symmetry is pervasive in robotics and has been widely exploited to improve
sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). However, existing
approaches primarily focus on spatial symmetries, such as reflection, rotation,
and translation, while largely neglecting temporal symmetries. To address this
gap, we explore time reversal symmetry, a form of temporal symmetry commonly
found in robotics tasks such as door opening and closing. We propose Time
Reversal symmetry enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (TR-DRL), a framework
that combines trajectory reversal augmentation and time reversal guided reward
shaping to efficiently solve temporally symmetric tasks. Our method generates
reversed transitions from fully reversible transitions, identified by a
proposed dynamics-consistent filter, to augment the training data. For
partially reversible transitions, we apply reward shaping to guide learning,
according to successful trajectories from the reversed task. Extensive
experiments on the Robosuite and MetaWorld benchmarks demonstrate that TR-DRL
is effective in both single-task and multi-task settings, achieving higher
sample efficiency and stronger final performance compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Autonomous robots must navigate and operate in diverse environments, from
terrestrial and aquatic settings to aerial and space domains. While
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific
autonomous robots, existing benchmarks are often constrained to unique
platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different
mobility systems. In this paper, we present NavBench, a multi-domain benchmark
for training and evaluating RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic
platforms and operational environments. Built on IsaacLab, our framework
standardizes task definitions, enabling different robots to tackle various
navigation challenges without the need for ad-hoc task redesigns or custom
evaluation metrics. Our benchmark addresses three key challenges: (1) Unified
cross-medium benchmarking, enabling direct evaluation of diverse actuation
methods (thrusters, wheels, water-based propulsion) in realistic environments;
(2) Scalable and modular design, facilitating seamless robot-task
interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; and (3) Robust
sim-to-real validation, demonstrated through successful policy transfer to
multiple real-world robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an
unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle. By ensuring consistency
between simulation and real-world deployment, NavBench simplifies the
development of adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design
allows researchers to easily integrate custom robots and tasks by following the
framework's predefined templates, making it accessible for a wide range of
applications. Our code is publicly available at NavBench.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了如何利用大语言模型（LLMs）增强软件质量保证（SQA）过程，并结合ISO/IEC等标准框架，分析了LLMs在需求验证、缺陷检测等任务中的应用及其挑战和未来方向。

Motivation: 随着LLMs技术的发展，其在SQA中的潜在应用逐渐显现，但如何与现有标准结合并解决实际挑战仍待研究。

Method: 综述了LLMs在SQA中的技术基础和应用场景，并通过案例研究和开源项目验证了其可行性。

Result: 研究表明LLMs可以提升SQA效率，但也面临数据隐私、模型偏见等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需关注自适应学习、隐私保护部署等技术方向，并推动AI驱动SQA的标准制定。

Abstract: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is critical for delivering reliable, secure,
and efficient software products. The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to
provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined
provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)
present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks
like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks.
Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010,
ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured
frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the
intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards,
highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while
maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational
software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software
engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including
requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation
maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks,
illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each
standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the
practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on
challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need
for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions
encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal
analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.

Result: 在SWE-bench基准上，Qwen-72B模型的成功率翻倍至40.8%，且在GPT-4o上同样有效。

Conclusion: 引导测试时搜索策略可显著提升LLMs在不可序列化环境中的性能，并具有跨模型通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable results in
complex multi-step tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and agentic software
engineering. However, they often struggle to maintain consistent performance
across multiple solution attempts. One effective approach to narrow the gap
between average-case and best-case performance is guided test-time search,
which explores multiple solution paths to identify the most promising one.
Unfortunately, effective search techniques (e.g. MCTS) are often unsuitable for
non-serializable RL environments, such as Docker containers, where intermediate
environment states cannot be easily saved and restored. We investigate two
complementary search strategies applicable to such environments: 1-step
lookahead and trajectory selection, both guided by a learned action-value
function estimator. On the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, a key testbed for
agentic software engineering, we find these methods to double the average
success rate of a fine-tuned Qwen-72B model, achieving 40.8%, the new
state-of-the-art for open-weights models. Additionally, we show that these
techniques are transferable to more advanced closed models, yielding similar
improvements with GPT-4o.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show human-level performance and their
specialized descendants, code generation models, play core roles in solving
complex tasks, including mathematical reasoning and software development. On
the downside, the hallucination of LLMs mainly hinders their applicability to
systems requiring higher safety standards, thus drawing the attention of the AI
community. However, the hallucination of code generation models is rarely
considered. One critical bottleneck in considering code hallucination is the
intricate property of code to identify whether generated code has the intended
functionality due to its un-natural form, different to natural languages.
Handful of unit tests have been considered to address this issue, but
scaling-up its size is extremely expensive. We address this core bottleneck by
automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, which
leverages the \emph{executable nature} of code. Given generated unit tests from
true code for measuring functional correctness of generated code, we propose to
learn a \emph{selective code generator}, which abstains from answering for
unsure generation, to control the rate of code hallucination among
non-abstaining answers in terms of a false discovery rate. This learning
algorithm provides a controllability guarantee, providing trustworthiness of
code generation. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation
as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this evaluation
paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selective code
generator over open and closed code generators, showing clear benefit of
leveraging generated unit tests along with the controllability of code
hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency via our selective code
generator.

Motivation: 机器学习系统（MLS）在动态环境中运行时面临数据漂移和模型退化等不确定性，传统MLOps仅解决技术维度，而忽略了经济、环境和社会等其他维度的可持续性问题。

Method: 提出了HarmonE架构，允许系统设计师在设计时定义可持续性目标和适应阈值，运行时监控关键指标（如预测准确性、能耗等），并触发适应的策略。

Result: 通过智能交通系统的数字孪生验证，HarmonE能够有效适应变化的条件，同时保持准确性并满足可持续性目标。

Conclusion: HarmonE为机器学习系统的可持续性提供了一种全面的解决方案，尤其是在动态环境中。

Abstract: Machine Learning Enabled Systems (MLS) are becoming integral to real-world
applications, but ensuring their sustainable performance over time remains a
significant challenge. These systems operate in dynamic environments and face
runtime uncertainties like data drift and model degradation, which affect the
sustainability of MLS across multiple dimensions: technical, economical,
environmental, and social. While Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses
the technical dimension by streamlining the ML model lifecycle, it overlooks
other dimensions. Furthermore, some traditional practices, such as frequent
retraining, incur substantial energy and computational overhead, thus
amplifying sustainability concerns. To address them, we introduce HarmonE, an
architectural approach that enables self-adaptive capabilities in MLOps
pipelines using the MAPE-K loop. HarmonE allows system architects to define
explicit sustainability goals and adaptation thresholds at design time, and
performs runtime monitoring of key metrics, such as prediction accuracy, energy
consumption, and data distribution shifts, to trigger appropriate adaptation
strategies. We validate our approach using a Digital Twin (DT) of an
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), focusing on traffic flow prediction as
our primary use case. The DT employs time series ML models to simulate
real-time traffic and assess various flow scenarios. Our results show that
HarmonE adapts effectively to evolving conditions while maintaining accuracy
and meeting sustainability goals.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效学习具有小边界体积的分类器的方法，适用于亚高斯各向同性对数凹分布的数据，并通过多项式回归等方法实现对抗鲁棒性。

Motivation: 研究如何高效学习对抗鲁棒性强的分类器，尤其是在扰动半径为r时，边界体积小的假设。

Method: 算法结合多项式回归、ℓ1误差回归、结构化分区与舍入步骤以及局部校正器，以确保分类器在扰动下的鲁棒性和低边界体积。

Result: 算法能够以时间与样本复杂度d^Õ(1/ε²)学习线性阈值函数，返回边界体积为O(r+ε)的分类器。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持多项式回归复杂度的同时，显著提升了分类器的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: We say that a classifier is \emph{adversarially robust} to perturbations of
norm $r$ if, with high probability over a point $x$ drawn from the input
distribution, there is no point within distance $\le r$ from $x$ that is
classified differently. The \emph{boundary volume} is the probability that a
point falls within distance $r$ of a point with a different label. This work
studies the task of computationally efficient learning of hypotheses with small
boundary volume, where the input is distributed as a subgaussian isotropic
log-concave distribution over $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Linear threshold functions are adversarially robust; they have boundary
volume proportional to $r$. Such concept classes are efficiently learnable by
polynomial regression, which produces a polynomial threshold function (PTF),
but PTFs in general may have boundary volume $\Omega(1)$, even for $r \ll 1$.
  We give an algorithm that agnostically learns linear threshold functions and
returns a classifier with boundary volume $O(r+\varepsilon)$ at radius of
perturbation $r$. The time and sample complexity of
$d^{\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ matches the complexity of polynomial
regression.
  Our algorithm augments the classic approach of polynomial regression with
three additional steps: a) performing the $\ell_1$-error regression under noise
sensitivity constraints, b) a structured partitioning and rounding step that
returns a Boolean classifier with error $\textsf{opt} + O(\varepsilon)$ and
noise sensitivity $O(r+\varepsilon)$ simultaneously, and c) a local corrector
that ``smooths'' a function with low noise sensitivity into a function that is
adversarially robust.

Conclusion: ExpMul算子显著提升了硬件加速器的效率，为长序列建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms, particularly within Transformer architectures and large
language models (LLMs), have revolutionized sequence modeling in machine
learning and artificial intelligence applications. To compute attention for
increasingly long sequences, specialized accelerators have been proposed to
execute key attention steps directly in hardware. Among the various recently
proposed architectures, those based on variants of the FlashAttention
algorithm, originally designed for GPUs, stand out due to their optimized
computation, tiling capabilities, and reduced memory traffic. In this work, we
focus on optimizing the kernel of floating-point-based FlashAttention using new
hardware operators that fuse the computation of exponentials and vector
multiplications, e.g., e^x, V. The proposed ExpMul hardware operators
significantly reduce the area and power costs of FlashAttention-based hardware
accelerators. When implemented in a 28nm ASIC technology, they achieve
improvements of 28.8% in area and 17.6% in power, on average, compared to
state-of-the-art hardware architectures with separate exponentials and vector
multiplications hardware operators.

Conclusion: PTME和坐标合并技术为网格生成领域的标记器优化和未来发展提供了指导。

Abstract: The next-coordinate prediction paradigm has emerged as the de facto standard
in current auto-regressive mesh generation methods. Despite their
effectiveness, there is no efficient measurement for the various tokenizers
that serialize meshes into sequences. In this paper, we introduce a new metric
Per-Token-Mesh-Entropy (PTME) to evaluate the existing mesh tokenizers
theoretically without any training. Building upon PTME, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenization technique called coordinate merging. It further
improves the compression ratios of existing tokenizers by rearranging and
merging the most frequent patterns of coordinates. Through experiments on
various tokenization methods like MeshXL, MeshAnything V2, and Edgerunner, we
further validate the performance of our method. We hope that the proposed PTME
and coordinate merging can enhance the existing mesh tokenizers and guide the
further development of native mesh generation.
