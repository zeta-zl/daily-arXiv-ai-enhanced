### [1] [Rosetta-PL: Propositional Logic as a Benchmark for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00001)
*Shaun Baek,Shaun Esua-Mensah,Cyrus Tsui,Sejan Vigneswaralingam,Abdullah Alali,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 构建Rosetta-PL评测基准，优化LLM在正式推理任务中的训练，提升低资源语言表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在高资源语言环境中的局限性，提升在低资源语言和深度逻辑推理任务中的表现。

Method: 通过转换Lean的逻辑命题数据集至自定义逻辑语言，并用于微调LLM（如GPT-4o），分析数据集大小和转换方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 保留逻辑关系的转换显著提升精度，训练样本超过20,000后精度趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 为优化LLM在正式推理任务的训练提供了实用指导，有助于提升低资源语言应用表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural
languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks
requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization
capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by
translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical
language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our
experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation
methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that
preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly
boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training
samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training
in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource
language applications.

### [2] [Symbol grounding in computational systems: A paradox of intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00002)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，指出无论心智计算是基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都隐含着语义先天论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨计算主义在解释心智符号接地问题上的局限性，揭示其隐含的语义先天论矛盾。

Method: 通过逻辑分析，提出心智计算必须基于有意义或无意义的符号的两种情况，并分别推导其矛盾。

Result: 无论心智计算基于哪种符号，计算主义都导致语义先天论，无法解释符号接地。

Conclusion: 计算主义框架下无法解决符号接地问题，需寻求其他理论突破。

Abstract: The paper presents a paradoxical feature of computational systems that
suggests that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding. If the mind is
a digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either
over meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols. If it is computing over
meaningful symbols its functioning presupposes the existence of meaningful
symbols in the system, i.e. it implies semantic nativism. If the mind is
computing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are
available prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could
take place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes. So,
whether computing in the mind is over meaningless or over meaningful symbols,
computationalism implies semantic nativism.

Method: 通过整合认知、发展、行为、社会、人格心理学及心理语言学的见解，分析心理学在LLM开发中的应用。

Result: 研究揭示了当前心理学理论在大语言模型开发中的应用趋势和不足，提出了跨学科整合的建议。

Conclusion: 本文强调了心理学在未来自然语言处理研究中的重要性，呼吁更深入、更系统地整合心理学理论。

Abstract: Psychological insights have long shaped pivotal NLP breakthroughs, including
the cognitive underpinnings of attention mechanisms, formative reinforcement
learning, and Theory of Mind-inspired social modeling. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) continue to grow in scale and complexity, there is a rising consensus
that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and
interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and
enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training,
and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive,
developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and
psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how
psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections
and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more
thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research.

### [4] [LangVAE and LangSpace: Building and Probing for Language Model VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00004)
*Danilo S. Carvalho,Yingji Zhang,Harriet Unsworth,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了LangVAE框架，通过预训练大语言模型（LLM）构建变分自编码器（VAE），生成更紧凑且语义解耦的表示，并提供了分析工具LangSpace。实验展示了多种架构组合的泛化和解耦表现，证明了其系统化研究文本表示的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何利用预训练语言模型的知识构建更高效的变分自编码器，以生成语义解耦的文本表示，并为其提供系统的分析工具。

Method: 提出LangVAE框架，基于预训练LLM构建VAE，并开发LangSpace工具进行分析，包括向量遍历、插值、解耦度量和聚类可视化等方法。

Result: 实验验证了不同编码器-解码器组合及标注输入的交互效果，展示了其在泛化和解耦方面的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: LangVAE和LangSpace为文本表示的系统化研究和理解提供了灵活、高效的框架。

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational
autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such
language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components
into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The
representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion
framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as
vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster
visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable
way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration
for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set
of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as
annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural
families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings
demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and
understanding of textual representations.

### [5] [Toward a digital twin of U.S. Congress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00006)
*Hayden Helm,Tianyi Chen,Harvey McGuinness,Paige Lee,Brandon Duderstadt,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于语言模型的美国议员虚拟模型，能生成与真实推文难以区分的推文，并预测投票行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过构建议员的数字孪生模型来预测其行为，为资源分配和立法动态提供参考。

Method: 使用议员推特数据集训练语言模型，生成类似真实推文的内容，并预测投票行为。

Result: 模型生成的推文与真实推文难以区分，并能有效预测议员的投票倾向和跨党派行为。

Conclusion: 研究展示了数字孪生模型的潜力，但也指出了局限性和未来扩展方向。

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S.
congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the
definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide
high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet
from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate
that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of
this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable
from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how
generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to
quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby
assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting
real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

### [7] [Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Task Learning through Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00009)
*Xiao Zhang,Kangsheng Wang,Tianyu Hu,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了TA-LoRA方法，通过低秩表示和快慢权重机制解决提示调优在多任务学习中难以捕捉任务异质性的问题，并在实验中取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）在未见任务上表现不佳，而多任务学习（MTL）通过迁移共享知识来解决这一问题。提示调优（PT）虽能高效微调，但无法充分捕捉任务异质性，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了TA-LoRA方法，结合低秩表示建模任务异质性，采用快慢权重机制分离共享和任务特定知识，并引入零初始化注意力机制以减少预热阶段对原始提示的干扰。

Result: 在16个任务上的实验表明，TA-LoRA在完整数据和少样本设置下均达到最优性能，同时保持较高的参数效率。

Conclusion: TA-LoRA通过改进提示调优的表示能力，有效解决了多任务学习中的异质性问题，成为了一种高效且性能优越的方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but
struggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.
Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task
learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from
source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that
captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt
that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,
PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific
knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this
challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL
method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task
heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes
shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,
avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training
low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention
mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank
components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks
demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and
few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何在教育领域的LLM中检测越狱行为，提出了一种基于语言特征的模型方法，效果优于提示工程，并建议未来探索混合框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为避免LLM在敏感领域（如教育）中的滥用，尤其是‘越狱’行为绕过伦理限制，研究聚焦于开发可靠的检测方法。

Method: 通过标注2300条提示数据，提取4种与越狱行为相关的语言特征，训练了决策树、模糊逻辑分类器、Boosting方法和逻辑回归等多模型。

Result: 基于特征的模型表现优于提示工程，其中模糊决策树效果最佳，证明语言特征模型是有效且可解释的越狱检测方案。

Conclusion: 研究验证了语言特征模型的实用性，建议未来结合提示灵活性与规则鲁棒性，开发实时越狱监测的混合框架。

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in
sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical
safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical
education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated
over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables
shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features
were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy
Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results
show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt
Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall
performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are
effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest
future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility
with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring
in educational LLMs.

### [10] [Performance Evaluation of Emotion Classification in Japanese Using RoBERTa and DeBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00013)
*Yoichi Takenaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过微调DeBERTa-v3-large模型，开发了一种高精度的日语文本情感分类工具，优于其他预训练模型和大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语文本情感检测在社交媒体监控和客户反馈分析中有广泛应用，但资源稀缺和类别不平衡问题限制了模型性能。

Method: 使用WRIME语料库，将读者平均强度分数转换为二分类标签，并微调四种预训练语言模型（BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa-v3-base、DeBERTa-v3-large），同时评估两种大型语言模型（TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct和ChatGPT-4o）。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-large取得了最佳平均准确率（0.860）和F1分数（0.662），在高低频情感分类中表现稳健，而大型语言模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 微调的DeBERTa-v3-large模型是目前日语情感二分类最可靠的解决方案，未来需优化数据增强和模型轻量化，并探索提示工程提升LLM表现。

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and
customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese
text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the
presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores
into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT,
RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two
large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and
F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score
(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both
high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions
(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and
TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most
reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release
this model as a pip-installable package (pip install
deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions,
reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.
  This manuscript is under review for possible publication in New Generation
Computing.

### [11] [Manifold-Constrained Sentence Embeddings via Triplet Loss: Projecting Semantics onto Spheres, Tori, and Möbius Strips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00014)
*Vinit K. Chavan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过将句子嵌入约束在连续流形上（如单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带），利用三元组损失作为训练目标，显著提升了嵌入的质量和结构表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入通常存在于无约束的欧几里得空间中，无法充分反映语言的复杂关系。为了改进这一点，作者探索了在流形空间中进行嵌入学习，以更好地捕捉语义和拓扑结构。

Method: 提出了一种约束句子嵌入在连续流形上的框架，使用三元组损失作为训练目标，通过在单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带等流形空间上进行投影。

Result: 在基准数据集（AG News和MBTI）上评估表明，流形约束嵌入（尤其是球面和莫比乌斯带）在聚类质量（Silhouette Score）和分类性能（Accuracy）上显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 研究证实了流形空间嵌入的价值，其拓扑结构能够补充语义分离，为NLP中的几何表示学习提供了新的数学基础方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning have emphasized the role of
embedding geometry in capturing semantic structure. Traditional sentence
embeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit
their ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on
continuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\"obius strip
-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential
geometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning
of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.
  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare
it to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained
Keras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained
embeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\"obius strips,
significantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality
(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings
highlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological
structure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically
grounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

### [12] [Design and Application of Multimodal Large Language Model Based System for End to End Automation of Accident Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00015)
*MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury,Moazzem Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文摘要主要介绍了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）和网页抓取技术的自动化系统，用于解决孟加拉国等发展中国家道路交通事故数据收集的不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事故数据收集方式多为手动、分散且不可靠，导致了数据遗漏和不一致的问题，亟需一种自动化、可靠的方法来改进。

Method: 该系统由四个模块组成：自动化网页抓取代码生成、在线新闻采集、事故新闻分类及结构化数据提取、以及去重算法。使用了多模态生成LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash来实现无缝自动化。

Result: 系统成功抓取了14个孟加拉国新闻网站，处理了超过15,000篇新闻文章，识别出705起独立事故，代码生成模块的校准和验证准确率分别为91.3%和80%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的可扩展系统能够低投入、高准确性地收集事故数据，为孟加拉国数据驱动的道路安全政策制定奠定了基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue
in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is
largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and
inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these
challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping
code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news
classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The
system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless
automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,
dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts
for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as
date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and
pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by
removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites
over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news
articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module
achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the
highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed
by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning
(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also
developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an
LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,
providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

### [13] [Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00016)
*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究将Text-to-SQL任务重新定义为通过SQL监督学习表格数据推理的框架，提出了一种结合链式思维（CoT）和强化学习（GRPO）的两阶段方法，显著提升了模型在复杂数据集上的推理性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在超越传统的查询生成任务，通过SQL监督开发模型对表格数据的通用推理能力，从而增强模型在复杂数据集上的表现和可解释性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）从真实SQL查询中合成详细的CoT轨迹，提供逐步的语法监督；2）引入GRPO强化学习目标，将SQL执行准确性与通用推理能力关联。

Result: 在Text-to-SQL基准测试上表现优异，尤其在BIRD和CRT-QA等推理密集型数据集上提升显著（如LLaMA模型准确率提升20%，Qwen提升5%）。

Conclusion: SQL不仅能作为目标形式，还能作为支架促进模型学习结构化数据的鲁棒且可迁移的推理能力。

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large
language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving
beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage
framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table
reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT)
traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level
supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table
fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to
generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific
syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves
performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains
on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced
generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized
LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL
tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can
serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for
learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

further designed a multi task workflow to optimize the annotation process.
Compared to general purpose LLMs, our method improves human evaluation scores
by up to 0.21 and semantic similarity by 6.1% across 11 tissue types, while
more closely aligning with the cognitive logic of manual annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长提示带来的高计算复杂度和经济成本问题，同时保持LLM的响应质量。

Method: 提出并比较了六种提示压缩方法，评估了其在生成性能、模型幻觉、多模态任务等方面的效果。

Result: 实验显示提示压缩对长上下文任务影响更大，适度压缩在Longbench评估中能提升LLM性能。

Conclusion: 提示压缩是可行的，尤其是在长上下文任务中，适度压缩能优化LLM表现。

Abstract: Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety
of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational
complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt
compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining
LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy
in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these
methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense
QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that
prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts
compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even
enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文使用合法获取的34本O'Reilly Media书籍数据集，通过DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，研究了OpenAI的大语言模型是否未经许可使用了受版权保护的内容。结果表明，GPT-4o对收费的O'Reilly书籍内容识别率较高（AUROC=82%），而GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容的识别率更高，较小的GPT-4o Mini则未显示对O'Reilly内容的了解。研究呼吁企业提高预训练数据源的透明度，以建立正式的AI内容训练许可框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于调查OpenAI的大语言模型是否未经许可使用了受版权保护的O'Reilly Media书籍内容，以呼吁企业在AI训练数据方面提高透明度和合法性。

Method: 研究方法采用了DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，对OpenAI的不同模型（GPT-4o、GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4o Mini）进行了测试，比较它们对收费和公开O'Reilly书籍内容的识别能力。

Result: GPT-4o显示出对收费O'Reilly书籍内容的较强识别能力（AUROC=82%），而GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容的识别率更高。GPT-4o Mini则未显示对O'Reilly内容的了解（AUROC≈50%）。

Conclusion: 研究结论强调了企业需要提高预训练数据源的透明度，以建立正式的AI内容训练许可框架，确保版权合规性。

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we
apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether
OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without
consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable
model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content
(AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast,
GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible
O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge
of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$
50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for
potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results
highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding
pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for
AI content training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品危害检测面临数据类别严重不平衡、文本短且非结构化、语义类别重叠等挑战，需改进分类模型效果。

Method: 使用BERT和RoBERTa作为主干分类器，结合随机过采样、Easy Data Augmentation (EDA)和焦点损失等数据平衡策略。

Result: 实验表明EDA有效缓解类别不平衡，显著提升准确率和F1值；结合焦点损失与过采样及EDA进一步增强了模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为食品危害检测的NLP分类模型开发提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Classification tasks often suffer from imbal- anced data distribution, which
presents chal- lenges in food hazard detection due to severe class imbalances,
short and unstructured text, and overlapping semantic categories. In this
paper, we present our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 9: Food Hazard Detection,
which ad- dresses these issues by applying data augmenta- tion techniques to
improve classification perfor- mance. We utilize transformer-based models, BERT
and RoBERTa, as backbone classifiers and explore various data balancing
strategies, including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and
focal loss. Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class
imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores.
Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances
model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples. These findings
contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models
for food hazard detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种德语数据集优化流程，结合启发式和模型过滤技术及合成数据生成，创建了大规模预训练数据集Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb，显著提升了德语LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据规模对大型语言模型（LLMs）至关重要，但研究发现数据质量更能显著提升模型性能和训练效率。因此，论文旨在优化德语数据质量以增强LLM效果。

Method: 采用启发式与模型过滤结合的技术，并引入合成数据生成，构建了Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb数据集。数据源包括Common Crawl、FineWeb2及基于真实网页的合成数据。通过训练1B参数的Llama风格模型和8B的无分词器分层自回归Transformer（HAT）进行验证。

Result: 在德语基准测试（如MMMLU）中，Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb表现显著优于仅使用FineWeb2的数据集，甚至在8B规模下优于加入人类精选数据（如维基百科）的FineWeb2。

Conclusion: 研究证明，基于模型的数据优化和合成数据生成能显著提升LLM预训练数据集质量，支持了数据质量对模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet
recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and
training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline
that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic
data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a
large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web
data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual,
organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style
model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A
comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant
performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage
holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated
high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing
body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation
can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Context Organizer (CORG)框架，用于高效处理文档中的复杂上下文关系，解决命名模糊、信息过时等问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语料库中知识常因命名模糊、信息过时或错误导致上下文关系复杂，现有语言模型难以同时处理多因素交互。

Method: CORG框架通过图构造器、重新排序器和聚合器，将多上下文分组独立处理，确保高效且去歧义。

Result: CORG在性能和效率上表现均衡，优于现有分组方法，接近计算密集型单上下文处理的性能。

Conclusion: CORG有效解决了多上下文复杂关系的处理问题，为语言模型提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but
often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information,
or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous
research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities,
typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these
relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and
duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses
all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context
Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into
independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently
find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three
key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results
demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively,
outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to
more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新方法Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1系列模型，通过二元奖励优化工具调用，无需标注推理轨迹，在BFCL和API-Bank基准上超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在工具调用能力上的不足，即要么忽略推理，要么产生限制泛化的模仿推理。

Method: 采用类似DeepSeek-R1的规则强化学习，仅评估工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性。

Result: Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B和14B在BFCL和API-Bank上达到SOTA，优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: 轻量级监督方法能自主内化推理策略，显著提升工具使用能力。

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal
strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior
work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning
traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short,
either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits
generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning
through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar
training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning
traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized
with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional
correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model
to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for
annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank
benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve
state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业医疗知识应用中的基础模型限制，如计算资源需求和部署环境要求高的问题。

Method: 设计知识转移流程，采用LoRA技术调整关键注意力层；实施4位权重量化等压缩技术；集成推理优化技术如Flash Attention加速。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上，模型内存消耗降低64.7%，推理延迟减少12.4%，同时保持专业准确性。

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境（如边缘计算设备）下的医疗大模型应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT
demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge
barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment
limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical
scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient
lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method,
systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from
three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational
optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline
is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology
is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression
level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are
implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical
reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization
techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are
integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt
to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical
question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper
maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and
inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the
application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such
as edge computing devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过自动提取文本中的关键维度（主语、动作、宾语、状语），支持高效文本操作和自然语言查询，减少冗余并提升查询效率。

Method: 采用基于树的表示方法，通过子类关系构建独立且高表达力的抽象树，覆盖大部分句子并支持多树联合搜索。

Result: 实验结果显示抽象树的平均精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%，自然语言查询覆盖率高且能快速定位目标句子。

Conclusion: 该方法通过树状结构和多维度搜索机制，显著提升了文本操作和自然语言查询的效率和精确性。

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject
dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from
texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The
high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and
adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The
independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between
trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can
be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at
least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in
natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and
F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of
subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application
of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates
that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have
high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object
and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space
to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

Motivation: 目前端到端语音对话系统在整合外部知识方面存在挑战，尤其面临语音与文本模态间的鸿沟问题。传统RAG方法需要语音转文本步骤，而论文旨在消除这一中间环节，直接提升知识整合效果。

Method: 提出了一种端到端的RAG框架，通过直接从语音查询中检索相关文本知识，绕过了传统语音转文本（ASR）的中间步骤。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了端到端语音对话系统的性能，同时实现了更高的检索效率。尽管性能仍低于级联模型，但为知识整合提供了有前景的方向。

Conclusion: 该框架为端到端语音对话系统的知识整合提供了有效解决方案，未来将通过公开代码和数据集推动进一步研究。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have
garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional
cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural
integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However,
these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating
external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core
difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual
knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant
textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate
speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of
end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency.
Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our
framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in
end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support
reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在训练分布之外的领域知识整合中存在局限性，直接适应方法容易导致基础能力的灾难性遗忘。

Method: 采用三阶段对话结构：基础保留（通过标题任务强化视觉语言对齐）、对比消歧（使用反事实示例维护语义边界）、知识专业化（通过思维链推理嵌入领域知识）。

Result: 实验证明SDFT能平衡领域知识学习和通用能力保留，在多个领域表现优异。

Conclusion: SDFT通过结构化对话模板和多轮监督框架，成功解决了领域适应中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile
capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant
limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their
training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct
adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger
catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We
introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that
effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic
forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and
subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method
employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces
pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive
Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to
maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized
information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across
multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized
knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions
include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment
with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision
framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

Motivation: 探讨语言模型模拟历史文本风格的可行性，以避免时代错位风险。

Method: 比较提示和微调两种方法生成的历史风格文本，并通过自动化评判与人工评估对比。

Result: 微调后的模型能欺骗自动化评判，但人工仍能区分其与真实历史文本。

Conclusion: 可靠模拟历史视角可能需要针对历史文本进行预训练。

Abstract: Before researchers can use language models to simulate the past, they need to
understand the risk of anachronism. We find that prompting a contemporary model
with examples of period prose does not produce output consistent with period
style. Fine-tuning produces results that are stylistically convincing enough to
fool an automated judge, but human evaluators can still distinguish fine-tuned
model outputs from authentic historical text. We tentatively conclude that
pretraining on period prose may be required in order to reliably simulate
historical perspectives for social research.

Motivation: 现有方法仅生成逐步解决方案，缺乏对抽象元知识的捕获，而人类在解决问题前通常会先进行高级抽象。LEPA旨在填补这一空白，通过模拟人类的认知过程提升模型性能。

Method: LEPA算法分两步：1) 基于问题生成前瞻性计划（抽象元知识）；2) 根据计划生成对齐的解决方案，并通过自我反思优化计划。模型训练时同时预测优化后的计划和解决方案。

Result: LEPA在多项自然语言推理基准测试中表现出显著优势，验证了抽象计划对模型泛化能力的关键作用。

Conclusion: 前瞻性计划作为元知识能有效指导语言模型解决问题，减少无关细节干扰。LEPA为自训练方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness
of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been
well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential
information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches
only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract
meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing
insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to
simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel
self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains
the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge
for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This
approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the
LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA
first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a
solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan
through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in
yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to
predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently
extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable
superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural
language reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 全球抑鬱症患者眾多，但醫療資源分佈不均且診斷方法複雜，導致許多地區對此疾病的關注不足。因此，開發高效診斷工具迫在眉睫。

Method: 研究從UK Biobank選取274,348條個體數據，設計表格數據轉換方法以構建訓練語料庫，並利用微調的大型語言模型（LLMs）進行訓練和評估。

Result: MDD-LLM（70B版本）達到0.8378的準確率和0.8919的AUC（95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040），顯著優於現有的機器學習和深度學習框架。

Conclusion: MDD-LLM展示了LLMs在抑鬱症診斷中的潛力，並探討了數據轉換技術和微調策略對性能的影響，為未來研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people
worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have
resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and
regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named
MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.
Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort
to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348
individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data
transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the
proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform
comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against
existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental
results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of
0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine
learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited
exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may
influence the performance of our proposed method, such as tabular data
transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies.

Method: 提出了一种联合学习全局时变傅里叶字典和每令牌混合系数的框架，结合时间域和频域重构损失，并在混合向量上应用GMM先验。

Result: 在WikiText2和Penn Treebank等标准基准测试中取得了竞争性的困惑度和生成质量，同时显著降低了计算复杂度和内存占用。

Conclusion: 光谱字典模型在性能接近Transformer基准的同时，显著提升了效率和可扩展性，为语言建模提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural
language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier
dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self
attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction
losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency
domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a
standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive
perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and
Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self
attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial
efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve
competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly
reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling
alternative for scalable language modeling.

### [30] [Improving Phishing Email Detection Performance of Small Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00034)
*Zijie Lin,Zikang Liu,Hanbo Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过Prompt Engineering、Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning和Model Ensemble等方法提升小参数大语言模型（LLMs）在钓鱼邮件检测中的性能，实验表明其方法能将准确率从0.5提升至0.976。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究中，表现优异的大语言模型通常需要数十亿参数和大量计算资源，而小参数模型在钓鱼邮件检测中表现不佳，因此研究如何提升这些小模型的性能以减少计算成本成为关键。

Method: 采用Prompt Engineering、Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning和Model Ensemble等方法优化小参数LLMs的训练和推理过程。

Result: 实验在SpamAssassin数据集上验证了方法的有效性，将Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct基线模型的准确率从约0.5提升至0.976。

Conclusion: 通过设计特定的优化方法，小参数LLMs在钓鱼邮件检测任务中的性能可以显著提升，同时降低计算资源需求。

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
natural language processing(NLP) tasks and have been employed in phishing email
detection research. However, in current studies, well-performing LLMs typically
contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous
computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the
effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs
have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However,
small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address
these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering,
Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email
detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the
SpamAssassin dataset from around 0.5 for baseline models like
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct to 0.976.

*Aayam Bansal,Raghav Agarwal,Kaashvi Jain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过自然语言处理技术分析1980-2020年间3814首嘻哈歌词，发现词汇多样性增加了23.7%，东海岸艺术家的词汇变化最高，中西部艺术家在押韵技术上最复杂。主题分析显示社会正义内容减少而内省主题增加，社会动荡时期歌词情感更消极。地理和时间因素与风格显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在量化嘻哈歌词的语言复杂性及其与社会文化趋势的关系，探讨嘻哈作为一种艺术形式和社会动态反映的演变。

Method: 使用自然语言处理技术分析3814首来自146位艺术家的歌曲，涵盖词汇多样性、押韵密度、主题建模和情感分析等多个维度。

Result: 词汇多样性增加23.7%，东海岸艺术家词汇变化最高（17.3%），中西部押韵技术最复杂（3.04/行）。社会正义主题减少，内省主题增加，社会危机时歌词更消极。地理和时间与风格强相关（r=0.68/0.59）。

Conclusion: 研究为嘻哈艺术形式和社会文化动态的关系提供了量化证据，揭示了语言创新与文化背景的相互作用。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational framework for analyzing
linguistic complexity and socio-cultural trends in hip-hop lyrics. Using a
dataset of 3,814 songs from 146 influential artists spanning four decades
(1980-2020), we employ natural language processing techniques to quantify
multiple dimensions of lyrical complexity. Our analysis reveals a 23.7%
increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists
demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density
increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the
highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified
significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing
from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6%
to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly
more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31
following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis-
tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin
(r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish
quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a
reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between
linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

*Zhongren Chen,Joshua Kalla,Quan Le,Shinpei Nakamura-Sakai,Jasjeet Sekhon,Ruixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过实验比较了LLM与传统政治竞选方法的说服效果与成本，发现LLM目前虽成本更低，但规模化应用仍受限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLM在政治说服中的潜力及其对民主社会的潜在威胁，特别是在成本效益和规模化应用方面。

Method: 采用两项调查实验（N=10,417）和真实世界模拟，比较LLM与传统竞选广告的说服力与成本，并考虑曝光和接受两个维度。

Result: LLM的说服效果与传统广告相当，但成本更低（48-74美元/选民 vs 100美元），不过规模化难度更大。

Conclusion: 目前LLM在政治说服上的潜力与传统方法相当，但随着技术发展，其规模化应用可能成为未来挑战。

Abstract: In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.

### [33] [HyPerAlign: Hypotheses-driven Personalized Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00038)
*Cristina Garbacea,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于假设驱动的个性化对齐方法（HyPerAlign），通过少量用户示例推断其沟通策略、个性和写作风格，生成定制化输出。实验表明该方法在作者识别和审慎对齐任务中优于传统偏好微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLM）的对齐通常基于多样用户的偏好聚合，导致输出偏向“平均用户”。然而，实际使用中用户需要针对其特定上下文和需求的个性化响应。

Method: 提出了HyPerAlign方法：通过少量用户示例推断其个性化特征（如沟通策略、写作风格），并将这些假设与用户特定属性结合，指导LLM生成定制化输出。

Result: 在作者识别任务中，HyPerAlign对最先进偏好微调方法的胜率普遍>90%；在审慎对齐任务中，模型帮助性平均提升70%。

Conclusion: HyPerAlign是一种可解释且样本高效的LLM个性化策略，能够为个体用户生成更贴合其需求的输出，优于传统偏好微调方法。

Abstract: Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.

Motivation: 法律规范具有复杂的层次结构、大量的内外引用和多时间版本，使得传统方法难以有效处理。本文旨在通过Graph RAG技术解决这些问题，提升法律数据的分析效率和准确性。

Method: 文章提出将知识图谱与上下文丰富的文本片段结合，利用层次结构和时间演化特性构建法律知识的互联表示。重点关注Graph RAG在法规数据集上的应用。

Result: Graph RAG方法成功构建了更丰富的法律知识表示，为法律研究、立法分析和决策支持提供了更高效的工具。

Conclusion: 该研究显著推进了AI在法律领域的应用，为处理复杂法律数据提供了创新方法，未来可能在相关领域产生广泛影响。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law,
creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research,
legislative analysis, and decision support.

### [35] [Base Models Beat Aligned Models at Randomness and Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00047)
*Peter West,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出，尽管对齐技术（如RLHF）在提升LLM安全性、指令遵循和任务性能上有效，但并非适用于所有任务。研究发现基础模型在某些需要不可预测输出的任务（如随机数生成、混合策略游戏、创意写作）中表现优于对齐模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对齐技术在不同任务中的适用性，揭示其在需要不可预测性或创造性的任务中可能产生的负面影响。

Method: 通过对比基础模型和对齐模型在随机数生成、混合策略游戏（如石头剪刀布、捉迷藏）和创意写作任务中的表现，分析其行为差异。

Result: 对齐模型在需要不可预测性的任务中表现受限，如偏好特定随机数、游戏策略过于可预测或创意写作缺乏原创性。常见基准表现越好的模型，在此类任务中表现越差。

Conclusion: 对齐技术需根据任务特性选择性应用，避免因过度对齐牺牲模型在特定场景下的能力。

Abstract: Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with
techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act
safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While
these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be
universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language
models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we
study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number
generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and
creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors
that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7"
over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some
game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across
models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with
worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the
required capabilities.

Motivation: 研究动机在于探索社交媒体情感分析是否能成为预测新兴时尚趋势的有效工具，特别是在时尚产业中。

Method: 通过自然语言处理和机器学习技术，分析推特数据，识别时尚相关内容，改进情感分类和时间序列分解，并验证统计因果模型。

Result: 配饰和街头服饰的情感趋势与主题流行度显著相关，Granger因果分析显示可持续性和街头服饰是主要驱动因素。模型在情感分类中达到78.35%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情感分析能有效预测时尚趋势，尤其是经统计验证后，可作为行业早期指标。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media
sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA
(Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language
processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns
in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for
emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and
categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with
improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically
validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,
and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between
sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and
streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger
causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend
drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The
findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an
effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical
validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced
accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for
trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网模因的聚类对毒性检测、传播建模和分类至关重要，但由于其多模态、文化背景和适应性，现有方法难以有效处理。

Method: 采用基于模板的匹配方法，结合局部和全局特征，通过形式、视觉内容、文本和身份等多维相似性进行聚类。

Result: 新方法在聚类一致性和连贯性上优于现有方法，且相似性特征集支持适应性并与人类直觉一致。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预定义数据库，支持自适应匹配，为后续研究提供了公开代码支持。

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

TL;DR: 论文介绍了BERSt数据集，用于评估复杂场景下的语音识别任务，如远距离语音识别（ASR）和情感识别（SER）。数据集包含多样化的语音样本，初步实验显示ASR性能受距离、喊叫和情感影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR在复杂场景中表现不佳。已有数据集主要关注多麦克风阵列的距离问题，但缺乏多样化的真实环境数据。BERSt旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过手机在98位演员家中采集语音样本，涵盖不同口音、情感提示（7种）、喊叫和说话，设备放置位置多样（19种）。

Result: ASR性能随距离和喊叫水平下降，且受情感影响。SER任务同样具挑战性。

Conclusion: BERSt数据集为ASR和SER提供了真实挑战，需进一步提升系统鲁棒性以适应实际应用。

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics.
Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with
distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the
issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance,
specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the
B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset
contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional
and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors
homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The
data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken
utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including
obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is
publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech
recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion
recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and
find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and
shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show
that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued
work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate
real-world use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLMs在真实商业智能环境中的应用限制，如语义幻觉和结构错误，并缺乏特定领域的评估框架。

Method: 方法包括构建一个包含219个自然语言商业问题的特定领域基准，使用Exaone 3.5 LLM生成SQL查询，并通过多种指标（如答案准确性、执行成功率等）进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，Exaone 3.5在简单任务中表现良好（L1准确率为93%），但在算术推理（H1准确率仅4%）和分组排名任务（H4准确率为31%）中表现较差。

Conclusion: 结论强调了LLMs在商业关键环境中的局限性，并提出了需要事实一致性验证层和混合推理方法，同时贡献了可复现的基准和评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language
interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation.
However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts
remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack
of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a
Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of
LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM
optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark
comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity
levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery
environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a
validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer
accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.
Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple
aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in
arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),
with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.
Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as
misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping
operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in
business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency
validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable
natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated
short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how
these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our
research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the
system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract
these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods
designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these
methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such
manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority
voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against
sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models
such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing
and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the
importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure
their reliability and fairness in high-stakes settings.

Conclusion: GDI-Bench和GDI模型填补了文档智能评估空白，模型和基准将开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application
scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks.
However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or
guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General
Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key
scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and
reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow
performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification
and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and
closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning
domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits
limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in
the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic
forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a
intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and
model will be open source.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决开放书问答中模型回答可能依赖其固有知识而非给定上下文的问题，并克服现有评估方法的偏见、可扩展性和成本问题。

Method: 提出了一种新指标，对比模型在提供上下文和不提供上下文时的回答困惑度，以此量化回答对上下文的依赖程度。

Result: 实验证明该指标有效识别回答是否基于给定上下文，且计算高效、可解释性强，适用于多种场景。

Conclusion: 新指标为开放书问答系统提供了一种可扩展、实用的上下文利用评估方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in
open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers
grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA
is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than
its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect.
Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach,
face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and
dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two
conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting
score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided
context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of
experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer
is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is
computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases,
offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in
open-book QA systems.

### [44] [Fine-Tuning LLMs for Low-Resource Dialect Translation: The Case of Lebanese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00114)
*Silvana Yakhni,Ali Chehab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于大语言模型（LLM）在低资源黎巴嫩方言翻译中的效果，比较了使用文化真实性数据与大规模翻译数据集的影响。研究发现，尽管数据量较小，但基于文化真实性数据训练的模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨文化真实性数据对于低资源方言翻译的重要性，挑战“数据越多越好”的传统范式。

Method: 采用了三种微调方法（基础、对比和语法提示微调），并在Aya23模型上进行实验，同时引入LebEval新评估基准。

Result: 文化真实性数据训练的模型表现优于大规模非原生数据训练的模型，对比微调结合对比提示效果最佳。

Conclusion: 文化真实性比数据量更重要，且对比学习对提升翻译质量有显著帮助。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, focusing on the impact of
culturally authentic data versus larger translated datasets. We compare three
fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using
open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a
smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform
those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved
through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which
indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In
addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark
derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes
benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and
emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation.
We made our datasets and code available on Github.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型语言模型在推理长度与答案正确性之间存在矛盾：简单问题时过度推理，复杂问题却推理不足。通过偏好优化算法缩短输出长度，可在保持准确性的同时显著减少生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在推理长度与答案正确性之间的关系，揭示模型可能因误判问题难度而调整推理长度的不足。

Method: 通过系统性实证研究分析推理长度与答案正确性的关联，并利用偏好优化算法测试缩短输出长度对准确性的影响。

Result: 发现模型在简单问题上过度推理，复杂问题上推理不足；通过偏好优化算法能显著减少输出长度且保持准确性。

Conclusion: 生成长度可作为推理行为的信号，未来需进一步探索模型在推理长度自适应中的自我意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning,
under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However,
emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy
rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study
of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find
that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long
outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it
is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty
and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization
algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer
correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly
reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight
generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate
further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

### [46] [AdaptMI: Adaptive Skill-based In-context Math Instruction for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00147)
*Yinghui He,Abhishek Panigrahi,Yong Lin,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了情境学习（ICL）在小语言模型（SLMs）中的性能差距，提出了一种自适应方法AdaptMI及改进版AdaptMI+，通过选择性引入技能示例提升SLMs在数学任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情境学习在大语言模型（LLMs）中表现良好，但在小语言模型（SLMs）中效果有限，甚至可能因信息过载而降低表现。本文旨在解决这一性能差距。

Method: 提出AdaptMI方法，根据认知负荷理论，仅在模型表现不佳时引入技能示例；进一步提出AdaptMI+，针对缺失技能补充示例。

Result: 在1B--7B规模的SLMs（如Qwen、Llama）上，AdaptMI+在5-shot评估中比传统技能策略准确率提升最高6%。

Conclusion: AdaptMI+有效解决了SLMs在情境学习中的性能问题，验证了适应性技能提示的优越性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its
problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context.
Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's
(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred
to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the
model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and
five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over
naive skill-based strategies.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种可解释的AI框架，用于分类放射学报告。通过提取信息丰富的查询及其答案来预测诊断，提高了医学AI的可信度和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医学诊断中的应用潜力巨大，但缺乏可解释性限制了其临床采用。研究旨在通过设计可解释的框架来提升诊断准确性和效率。

Method: 结合信息追踪框架提取关键查询，使用Flan-T5模型确定报告中是否存在相关事实，并通过分类器预测疾病。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性，显示了其在增强医学AI信任和实用性方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了AI在放射学报告分类中的可解释性，还为临床环境中的AI应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of AI-based methods for analyzing radiology reports could
lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis--from improving diagnostic
accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload. However, the lack of
interpretability in these methods has hindered their adoption in clinical
settings. In this paper, we propose an interpretable-by-design framework for
classifying radiology reports. The key idea is to extract a set of most
informative queries from a large set of reports and use these queries and their
corresponding answers to predict a diagnosis. Thus, the explanation for a
prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries and answers. We use
the Information Pursuit framework to select informative queries, the Flan-T5
model to determine if facts are present in the report, and a classifier to
predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance
trust and usability in medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对韩语教育的兴趣增长，但缺乏针对韩语二语写作的学习者语料库。

Method: 扩充KoLLA语料库，加入多参考语法纠错和基于评分的标注，以更灵活评估纠错系统。

Result: 增强了语料库的多样性和标准化，支持韩语学习、评估和自动纠错的研究。

Conclusion: 改进后的KoLLA成为韩语二语教育的强有力资源，推动相关领域发展。

Abstract: Despite growing global interest in Korean language education, there remains a
significant lack of learner corpora tailored to Korean L2 writing. To address
this gap, we enhance the KoLLA Korean learner corpus by adding multiple
grammatical error correction (GEC) references, thereby enabling more nuanced
and flexible evaluation of GEC systems, and reflects the variability of human
language. Additionally, we enrich the corpus with rubric-based scores aligned
with guidelines from the Korean National Language Institute, capturing
grammatical accuracy, coherence, and lexical diversity. These enhancements make
KoLLA a robust and standardized resource for research in Korean L2 education,
supporting advancements in language learning, assessment, and automated error
correction.

Motivation: 当前语言模型在不同场景下难以保持一致性，而人类自然沟通却能做到。论文旨在探索如何提升AI语言系统的形式和内容一致性，并填补研究空白。

Method: 论文通过分析现有的形式一致性（如逻辑规则遵循）和内容一致性（如道德和事实连贯性）的测量方法，识别研究中的关键问题。

Result: 研究发现目前缺乏标准化的定义、多语言评估和提升一致性的方法，亟需更强大的测量基准和跨学科解决方案。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁建立更全面的基准测试和跨学科方法，以确保语言模型在领域特定任务中保持一致性，同时不牺牲其实用性和适应性。

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing
similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human
communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language
models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.
This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language
systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)
and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze
current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical
research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and
methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust
benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in
the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving
the utility and adaptability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming education, presenting
unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning and streamlined content
creation. However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings
necessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical
implications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from
four related studies to propose a comprehensive framework for enhancing
AI-driven educational tools. We integrate cognitive assessment frameworks
(Bloom's Taxonomy and SOLO Taxonomy), linguistic analysis of AI-generated
feedback, and ethical design principles to guide the development of effective
and responsible AI tools. We outline a structured three-phase approach
encompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical
safeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through
its integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz
generation. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for
educators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年认知扭曲对心理健康影响重大，但现有NLP研究多基于小规模成人数据，缺乏针对青少年的研究。

Method: 构建KoACD数据集（108,717条），通过多LLM协商方法（认知澄清与认知平衡）优化分类并生成合成数据。

Result: LLMs对显性标记分类有效，但语境依赖推理能力弱于人类评估者；KoACD验证了数据增强方法的可行性。

Conclusion: KoACD为认知扭曲检测研究提供了新资源，未来可结合人类与LLM优势提升模型性能。

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to
mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous
studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on
small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study
introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in
Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large
Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and
generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for
textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.
Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs
classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with
context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher
accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion
detection.

Motivation: 生成式预训练语言模型在学术和工业界占据主导地位，但缺乏针对其的无监督文本表示方法。

Method: 利用生成式模型的结构特性，开发CSE-SFP方法，通过单次前向传播实现对比学习。

Result: 实验表明CSE-SFP能生成更高质量的嵌入，同时大幅减少训练时间和内存消耗，并引入新指标评估语义空间特性。

Conclusion: CSE-SFP为生成式模型提供了高效的无监督表示方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics,
sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical
applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering
systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through
unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like
BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have
attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative
PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that
state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based
on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient
unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To
address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits
the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing
strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective
unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly
reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce
two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby
providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of
encoding models.

for which a large language model (LLM) outputs a response that could cause
clinical harm. Red-teaming with clinicians enables the identification of LLM
vulnerabilities that may not be recognised by LLM developers lacking clinical
expertise. We report the vulnerabilities found, categorise them, and present

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别法规中的监管条款对衡量法规密度和严格度的指标开发非常有用，但现有方法对不同定义过于模糊，需要一个更明确的定义。

Method: 使用了基于依存解析和Transformer模型的两种方法，采用机构语法工具明确监管条款的定义。

Result: 两种方法表现相近，准确率分别为80%和84%，K alpha为0.58，显示两者结合有潜力。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势，未来可结合使用以提高识别效果。

Abstract: Identifying regulatory statements in legislation is useful for developing
metrics to measure the regulatory density and strictness of legislation. A
computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such
statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately
180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of
these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what
constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific
definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop
and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such
statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on
a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed
similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of
0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential
for combining strengths of both approaches.

grounded in supporting evidence$\unicode{x2013}$has become a critical
challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often
synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document
contexts and full-sentence outputs. We introduce the HalluMix Benchmark, a
diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains
and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection
systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed
source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks,
document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights
substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with
critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel
evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of
DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in
the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of
language models. However, the implementation details of the released models
have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication
studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by
DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training
procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated
feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design,
yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of
recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on
SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data
construction, method design and training procedure of current replication
studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and
experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future
research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting
the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and
discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help
researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements,
and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于提示的框架（HIP和HQP）来系统触发和量化大型语言模型中的幻觉现象，并通过实验发现不同模型在幻觉反应上的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）中的幻觉现象（即生成流畅但不真实的内容），尤其是在需要事实可靠性的实际应用中的影响。

Method: 提出两种提示：幻觉诱导提示（HIP）通过误导性融合语义疏离的概念触发幻觉，幻觉量化提示（HQP）评估输出的合理性、置信度和连贯性。

Result: 实验发现HIP生成的响应比对照组更不连贯且更具幻觉性，且不同模型（推理导向型与通用型）表现出差异。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究幻觉脆弱性提供了可重复的测试平台，并为开发能自我检测和调节概念不稳定性的更安全LLM奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge
across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual
reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,
LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.
Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains
an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to
systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing
Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,
periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a
Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,
confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple
LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more
hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied
across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from
general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for
studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,
more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of
conceptual instability.

Motivation: 扩展大语言模型（LLM）的上下文窗口在生成长篇内容时很重要，但线性增长的KV缓存需求与自注意力的二次复杂度带来挑战。现有方法扩展到长上下文时性能下降。

Result: 实验表明，FreqKV在多项长上下文语言建模与理解任务中均表现出高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: FreqKV通过频域压缩KV缓存，以最小信息损失实现长上下文高效扩展，且无需额外调整。

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear
increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic
complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present
significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods
suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this
work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in
the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily
concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency
components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information
loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique,
FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in
the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV
introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With
minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is
compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently.
Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model
size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing
fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method
with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant

approach presents a promising way in frequency domain to fine-tune large models

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant
computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,
domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.
Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for
domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation
when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for
deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.
FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its
ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract
domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with
domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain
essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,
these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated
datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves
highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale
state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show
that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their
original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,
applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also
improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our
approach. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法可能仅依赖于记忆已知触发器而非真正区分角色，因此需要一种更可靠的方式来确保LLM在多角色场景中行为一致。

Method: 通过简单的控制实验框架分析微调模型的角色识别代理，并提出通过调整输入编码（如位置ID）来强化角色边界的不变信号。

Result: 发现微调模型依赖任务类型和文本开头位置等表面代理，数据增强仅能部分缓解问题，而调整输入编码（如位置ID）能更有效地提升角色分离效果。

Conclusion: 通过机制为中心的视角，提出了更可靠的LLM多角色行为维护方法，减少了对表面代理的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,
system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly
prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our
work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role
behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought
experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing
logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,
and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these
differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,
to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for
understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language
models, and practically improving their performance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种两阶段框架来增强大语言模型（LLM）在数学解题步骤中的深度批判能力，通过监督微调和强化学习显著提升了批判模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的批判能力过于浅显，无法提供足够的反馈以纠正错误，因此需要一种更有效的批判方法。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct生成4.5K长格式批判数据，进行监督微调，再通过强化学习（使用PRM800K或自动标注数据）提升模型能力。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct的批判模型在多个错误识别基准上显著优于现有模型（如DeepSeek-R1-distill和GPT-4o），并能更有效地帮助生成模型修正错误。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段框架有效提升了LLM批判能力的深度和实用性，为自动化监督提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate
feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the
same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error
identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator
refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: Memory is a fundamental component of AI systems, underpinning large language
models (LLMs) based agents. While prior surveys have focused on memory
applications with LLMs, they often overlook the atomic operations that underlie
memory dynamics. In this survey, we first categorize memory representations
into parametric, contextual structured, and contextual unstructured and then
introduce six fundamental memory operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing,
Forgetting, Retrieval, and Compression. We systematically map these operations
to the most relevant research topics across long-term, long-context, parametric
modification, and multi-source memory. By reframing memory systems through the
lens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a
structured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools
related to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based
agents while outlining promising directions for future research\footnote{The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多种风格改写上展现出强大能力，但如何利用其能力实现基于示例的任意风格转移（即输入文本匹配给定示例风格）仍具挑战性。核心问题在于如何描述示例风格以引导LLMs生成高质量改写。

Method: 研究提出了一种基于语域分析的提示方法，通过结构化风格描述（如语域特征）指导LLMs完成风格转移任务。

Result: 在多种风格转移任务上的实验表明，该方法在增强风格转换强度的同时，相比现有提示策略能更有效地保留原文意义。

Conclusion: 基于语域分析的提示方法为利用LLMs实现高质量风格转移提供了有效途径，平衡了风格适配与内容保真度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this
ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is
rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A
key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward
high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on
register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations
across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances
style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing
prompting strategies.

Motivation: 跑步期间的生理响应理解对于运动表现优化、个性化训练和健康管理至关重要。当前缺乏基于消费级穿戴设备的VO$_{2}$预测方法，需填补这一技术空白。

Method: 采用两种互补的生理模型：1）通过生理约束ODE和神经卡尔曼滤波器建模心率动态，训练超过300万次心率观测；2）基于心率模型，设计仅需初始秒级VO$_{2}$数据校准的序列到序列代谢需求预测架构。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将生理约束嵌入现代机器学习，实现了实验室级精度的代谢监测普及，为精英运动员和健身爱好者提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for
performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health
management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the
first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$)
trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach
employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart
rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential
equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR
observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors
as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of
precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only
the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust,
sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on
smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage
errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological
transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our
synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays
the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By
embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this
framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade
accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and
recreational fitness enthusiasts.

Motivation: 传统的多目标滤波方法如GM-PHD和SMC-PHD存在一定的局限性，无法很好地平衡计算效率和精度。因此，作者提出了一种结合两者优势的新方法EnGM-PHD，以提升多目标跟踪的性能。

Method: EnGM-PHD滤波器通过从后验强度函数中获取粒子，通过系统动力学传播这些粒子，然后使用核密度估计（KDE）技术近似高斯混合的先验强度函数，从而结合了高斯混合和粒子滤波的特性。

Conclusion: EnGM-PHD滤波器在多目标跟踪任务中表现出色，不仅高效且精度高，是一种有前景的滤波方法。

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis
Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications.
The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the
Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the
particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis
Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the
posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and
then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the
Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees
convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of
components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births,
deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces
to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented
experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better
multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters
while using the same number of components or particles.

Result: 在AMD EPYC 7742 CPU上，GPRat在64核上训练时扩展性优于GPyTorch和GPflow，预测速度分别提升7.63倍和25.25倍；特征数从8增至128时，速度提升29.62倍和21.19倍。

Conclusion: 异步任务在Python AI应用中具有潜力，GPRat结合了易用性与高性能，展示了异步运行时模型的优势。

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial
intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow,
rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on
CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to
performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of
binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a
high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process
(GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines
the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and
scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a
mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for
varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding
overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to
GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD
EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction
speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number
of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19,
respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks
within Python-based AI applications.

Conclusion: BF-SSD通过整合双精度策略，为大规模高维问题提供了一种高效的计算方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous
scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and
gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order
optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are
inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost
associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity
stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order
optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD
leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a
combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate
high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an
efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we
provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct
problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge
regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and
transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results
demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance
while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to
relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating
bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as
a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale,
high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in
oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence
triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and
escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However,
existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often
overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for
patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning
framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve
NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for
categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments,
allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes
and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the
data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction
performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides
clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential
features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves
accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical
methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through
feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new
important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and
hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction
models.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality
worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient
outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex
nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and
thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN),
Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease
outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including
handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation,
followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad
precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used
to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that
ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently
outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly
in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML
and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis
and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data
quality, model interpretability, and the need for advanced computational
techniques in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of
chronic diseases. This study was conducted as part of Big Data class project
under the supervision of our professors Mr. Abderrahmane EZ-ZAHOUT and Mr.
Abdessamad ESSAIDI.

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）通过字典学习从神经网络中提取可解释特征，但计算成本高。研究发现字典重要性遵循幂律，比较了基于子集修剪的渐进编码与联合训练的嵌套SAEs（Matryoshka SAEs）。Matryoshka SAEs在重建损失和语言建模任务上表现更好，但修剪后的普通SAEs更易解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）在大规模神经网络中提取可解释特征方面具有潜力，但其计算成本高，尤其是在需要多种尺寸SAEs时。研究旨在探索更高效的方法，同时保持或提升性能。

Method: 研究比较了两种方法：基于子集修剪的渐进编码（progressive coding）和联合训练嵌套SAEs（Matryoshka SAEs）。通过在语言建模任务上评估这两种方法，分析其性能差异。

Result: Matryoshka SAEs在重建损失、语言建模损失和表征相似性上表现优于普通SAEs。然而，修剪后的普通SAEs在可解释性上更优。研究揭示了这一性能与可解释性的权衡。

Conclusion: Matryoshka SAEs在性能上更优，但普通SAEs在修剪后更具可解释性。这一发现为在不同场景下选择SAEs提供了依据，同时强调了性能与可解释性之间的取舍。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
\citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders}
rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural
networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to
representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however,
computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially
when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary
importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding
based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or
so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs
\citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling
task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured
language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned
vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and
implications of this trade-off.

Conclusion: 该框架为计算神经科学和临床研究提供了可扩展且个体化的脑活动建模工具，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on
low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain
activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual
differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods
either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is
temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because
event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can
capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and
temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two
naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework
outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and
individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales
efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test
this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data
from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our
method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with
schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework
scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen
subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal
clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal
ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation
in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings
suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific
brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and
individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in
computational neuroscience and clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态制造过程具有时变参数、非线性行为和不确定性，传统方法难以应对。生成式ML能建模复杂分布并生成合成数据，但在制造控制中缺乏功能导向的视角，需要将其概率理解转化为可行的控制策略。

Method: 本文提出了功能分类法，包括基于预测的方法、直接策略、质量推理和知识集成方法，并在该框架下分析生成式ML架构的控制相关特性和潜力。

Result: 生成式ML在决策、过程指导、模拟和数字孪生等应用中展现出潜力，但也存在生成与控制功能分离、对制造现象的物理理解不足等问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向是开发集成框架，结合生成式ML和控制技术，以应对现代制造系统的动态复杂性。

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by
time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These
characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing
multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to
real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative
machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex
distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing
uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic
manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to
translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls
while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification
of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated
approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced
control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML
architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties
and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional
methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing
control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and
digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between
generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of
manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To
address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at
developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control
technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前行业标准的生成AI和特征编码器多为黑箱，限制了混合专家模型的内部参数优化。研究通过非竞争博弈论视角，解决黑箱AI在盲竞争环境中的协同问题。

Method: 设计去中心化联邦学习算法，利用纳什均衡的闭式解反馈机制，使各AI代理本地优化参数且不泄露内部结构，支持预训练模型（如Transformer、随机特征模型）。

Result: 在真实和合成时间序列基准测试中，预测精度实现了数量级提升，填补了该领域研究空白。

Conclusion: 提出的“私有联邦学习”算法有效解决了黑箱AI的协同优化难题，为混合专家模型提供了可扩展且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary,
offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their
internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This
black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert
type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's
internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive
game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing
against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to
their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the
user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing
AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting,
which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between
any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI
agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning
algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their
machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain
refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature
models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning''
algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series
benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy
over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this
natural problem still being largely unexplored.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于纵向表格Transformer（LTT）的模型，用于提高自然灾害期间电力恢复时间（ETR）的预测准确性，通过历史停电事件数据和顺序更新实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在当前气候变化加剧的背景下，电力公司需要提供准确的电力恢复时间预测，以便客户能更好地准备应对长时间的断电。然而，现有的手动或传统统计方法无法满足高精度预测的需求。

Method: 作者提出了一种纵向表格Transformer（LTT）模型，利用历史停电数据及其顺序更新来优化ETR预测。

Result: 在三大公用事业公司34000多起风暴相关停电事件上的测试显示，LTT模型的客户满意度影响（CSI）指标平均提高了19.08%（p > 0.001）。此外，模型引入了客户导向的回归指标和可解释性技术。

Conclusion: LTT模型显著提高了ETR预测的准确性和透明度，增强了客户对模型的信任。

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver
precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has
become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for
enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed
decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.
Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual
assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the
level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address
these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model
that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of
these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's
performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three
major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a
2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer
Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression
metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the
outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ
interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of
incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the
contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive
approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,
fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models
have revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and
speech recognition. While server-based deployments remain the locus of peak
performance, the imperative for on-device inference, necessitated by privacy

accelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework
that extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference
engines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which
contain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI
models. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with
cross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and
desktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly
more complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI
inference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement
relative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自我生成的成功经验数据库来提升大型语言模型（LLM）代理性能的方法，无需依赖任务特定的知识工程。通过累积成功轨迹和两种选择策略，性能显著提升，且在三个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提高LLM代理性能的方法通常依赖任务特定的知识工程（如提示调整或定制观察/动作空间），但这些方法需要大量人工投入。本研究旨在探索如何通过代理自我学习来减少这种依赖性。

Method: 方法包括构建和优化自我生成的成功轨迹数据库。首先通过累积成功轨迹提升性能；随后引入两种扩展：基于种群训练的数据库级选择和基于实证效用的示例级选择，以进一步优化性能。

Result: 在ALFWorld（73%到89%）、Wordcraft（55%到64%）和InterCode-SQL（75%到79%）三个基准测试中，性能显著提升，最高达到91%，与复杂任务特定方法相当。

Conclusion: 研究表明，自动化的轨迹数据库构建是替代人工密集型知识工程的有效方案，尤其在减少任务特定依赖性方面表现出潜力。

Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential
decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as
prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and
action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the
quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate
how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning
in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than
relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and
refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a
naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test
performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),
and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent
achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two
extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to
identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection
that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as
in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving
91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific
components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory
database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive
knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional
medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern
drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value.
A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases
and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine
ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association
prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation
learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node
embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next,
the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to
enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and
robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more
accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the
model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The
results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed
existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby
indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further
revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case
studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive
retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking
experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction
and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the
Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts
ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic
information.

Conclusion: HFGNN方法有效解决了金融数据跨境共享中的隐私问题，同时提升了模型性能和效率。

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial
institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of
interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To
effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow
and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize
the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations
in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural
Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous
business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the
sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a
statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each
subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local
training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated
parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature
information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show
that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence
speed than existing methods.

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging
due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface
characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical
approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often
limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research
presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning
approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM)
model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal
dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified
dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and
a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the
soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together
with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A
four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to
assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM
retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation
coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and
surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the
over-simplification in WCM.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective
human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or
guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,
strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human
skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a
strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,
the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate
player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that
human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to
improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.
Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different
skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We
then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to
estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method
achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which
increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous
state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20
matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements
in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength

Conclusion: HMFNet通过多层级特征提取和化学感知损失，为AI驱动的气味预测技术发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to
predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can
suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic
descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder
effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class
imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these
challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature
Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local
Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature
extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor
prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we
integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically
learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's
capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy
Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the
molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global
information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To
further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed
Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its
potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the
development of AI-driven technologies.

Motivation: 研究循环GNNs的表达能力，尤其是其在颜色细化算法（Weisfeiler-Leman）框架下的极限性能，并探讨其与传统非循环GNNs的区别。

Method: 通过理论分析，比较循环GNNs与非循环GNNs在Weisfeiler-Leman框架下的表达能力，并引入随机初始化扩展其模拟能力。

Result: 循环GNNs在多项式时间与空间开销内可模拟任何颜色细化算法框架内的图算法，且通过随机初始化可模拟所有多项式时间复杂度的图算法。

Conclusion: 循环GNNs在表达能力上达到了理论极限，且其性能可通过随机初始化进一步扩展，为图算法模拟提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural
Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that
recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph
algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the
color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that
the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI
2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually
reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the
power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every
graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we
construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent
GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph
algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN
with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

TL;DR: TAEGCN模型结合时间注意力和动态图卷积网络，提升了多元时间序列预测的准确性，尤其在动态图结构场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多元时间序列常呈现动态图结构，且时间尺度上的交互变化显著。现有方法多假设固定图结构，难以捕捉精确的时空特征。

Method: 提出TAEGCN，整合因果时间卷积、多头自注意力机制学习节点时间特征，并基于时间特征构建动态图结构以确保时空变化一致性。

Result: 在METR-LA和PEMS-BAY数据集上，TAEGCN表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: TAEGCN能有效捕捉时空依赖性，为动态图结构下的时间序列预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states
by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes.
Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple
dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph
structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph
structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures.
Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary
significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and
spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional
Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates
causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn
temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure
based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in
spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal
relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,
TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these
components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two
public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed model.

Motivation: Transformer在处理多变量时间序列时面临同时建模跨时间和跨变量依赖的挑战，现有方法未能高效整合这两种信息。

Method: 通过独立嵌入变量捕获跨时间动态，利用注意力机制建模跨变量依赖，并引入门控机制优化信息流。

Result: 在13个真实数据集上达到SOTA性能，性能提升最高达20.7%。

Conclusion: Gateformer通过门控和注意力机制有效整合跨时间和跨变量信息，可无缝集成到其他Transformer或LLM预测模型中。

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少自注意力机制的二次计算成本，同时保持性能。

Method: 基于混合专家（MoE）思想，动态选择token，实现任意稀疏注意力模式。

Result: MoSA在相同计算预算下表现优于密集基线，最高提升27%困惑度，并降低资源使用。

Conclusion: MoSA是一种高效且性能优越的稀疏注意力方法，适用于大规模语言模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic
cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic
attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We
hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

Motivation: 由于CPM在模拟复杂多细胞生物系统时需要显式建模大量个体和偏微分方程（PDE），计算成本高昂，该研究旨在通过深度学习模型解决这一问题。

Method: 使用U-Net架构设计CNN替代模型，考虑周期性边界条件，并训练该模型预测100个MCS步骤的仿真结果。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法可高效替代传统CPM仿真，为研究更大时空尺度的生物过程提供了更快的工具。

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for
developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological
systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due
to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual
model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate
model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary
conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM
previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate
model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps,
MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to
CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively
captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts
model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction
of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning
to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster
evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater
spatial and temporal scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于凸优化的向量压缩感知方法在高维情况下被证明是次优的，因此需要一种更高效的算法来解决这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了SteinSense算法，这是一种轻量级的迭代方法，无需调参、训练数据或稀疏性知识，且易于实现和扩展。

Result: 大量真实和合成实验验证了SteinSense的高效性，理论分析基于近似消息传递思想，并显示出算法在现实数据和非理想条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SteinSense在高维向量恢复中表现出色，优于传统方法，且具有简单和鲁棒的特点。

Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements
rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For
about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been
synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In
the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a
straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex
Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly
when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight
iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not
have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero
knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this
makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume
of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense,
and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate
Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust,
delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under
substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated
learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints
and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues
by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large
models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework
that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We
provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance
effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose
Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification
method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix
multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations.
Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA})
algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts
bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency
constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing
communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient
deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

Motivation: 虽然目前的文本到视频生成模型在美学与指令遵循上表现优异，但它们常违反基本物理定律（如刚体碰撞、能量守恒等），亟需一种基于基本原理的评估方法。

Method: 提出T2VPhysBench，通过人类评估和三项针对性研究（总体合规性分析、提示词消融实验、反事实鲁棒性测试）系统性测试模型对物理定律的遵守情况。

Result: 所有模型在12类物理定律上的平均得分均低于0.60；即使提供详细提示词仍无法纠正物理错误；模型甚至能按指令生成明显违反物理规则的视频。

Conclusion: 当前架构存在局限性，需进一步研究以实现真正具备物理感知能力的视频生成。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent
years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and
accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation
and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to
respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still
violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,
and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading
content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,
pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus
overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we
introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that
systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both
open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian
mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark
employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted
studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score
below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation
revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics
violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models
often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.
The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer
concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video
generation.

Conclusion: SOLO通过超低精度量化显著降低内存开销，为解决计算资源瓶颈提供了可行方案，有助于推动基础研究的普及。

Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive
training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain
auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence.
We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with
extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision
quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit
or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision
as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by
identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem
in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the
rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to
incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored
logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value
for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory
savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy
loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in
computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental
research.

Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for
effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy
Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs.
However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on
large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and
geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform
well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate
predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly
electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively
across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is
demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime
climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves
high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its
robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and
winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against
state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results
indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing
its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying
climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the
model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy
Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage
Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices
necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance
the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study
introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages
preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights,
thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed
methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability
across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our
framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the
original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In
comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only
augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential
weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical
model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven
quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization
of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in
training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.
First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task
types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving
performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of
domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via
R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity
(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data
composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients
obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for
additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or
gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and
provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to
non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and
multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B
matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms
remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained
attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle
arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining
strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when
data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based
on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream
clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this
paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm
adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity,
summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It
then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final
clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge
of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TIF的新型树状解释框架，通过将普通GNN转化为多粒度层次树结构，改善了现有子图解释方法对长距离依赖关系的忽略问题，并在图分类任务中表现出优异的解释性和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于子图的解释方法过于关注局部结构，可能忽略图中的长距离依赖关系；而依赖图粗化的方法虽有助于全局解释性，但固定粒度的处理无法捕捉现实图中多粒度的关系。

Method: TIF通过图粗化模块迭代生成多粒度树结构，辅以图扰动模块保持分支多样性，并利用自适应路由模块选择最信息化的路径，实现多粒度解释。

Result: 在合成的和真实世界的数据集上的实验表明，TIF在解释性和预测性能上均有优异表现。

Conclusion: TIF不仅解决了现有多粒度关系捕捉不足的问题，还在解释性和性能上达到了与最先进方法相当的水平。

Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying
reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific
subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable
methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking
long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that
rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability,
they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible
way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world
graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g.,
relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids,
and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like
Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are
transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs
of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a
graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees)
into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving
diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph
perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify
the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final
prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making
process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in
interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance
akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 为解决分布式计算环境中设备端机器学习模型面临的数据动态变化挑战，提出了联邦持续学习（FCL）框架SacFL，通过编码器-解码器架构和对比学习实现低存储需求与任务自主检测，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式设备端机器学习模型需应对数据动态变化（如数据漂移），传统持续学习（CL）方案因隐私和计算资源问题不适用，因此提出联邦持续学习（FCL）框架SacFL。

Method: SacFL采用编码器-解码器架构分离任务鲁棒与敏感组件以减少存储需求，并结合对比学习实现任务自主检测，支持设备端触发CL或防御策略。

Result: 在Cifar100、THUCNews等数据集上验证了SacFL在类增量与域增量场景的有效性，并开发了演示系统验证实用性。

Conclusion: SacFL为资源受限设备提供了一种高效、自主的联邦持续学习解决方案，显著提升了模型适应动态数据的能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,
wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data
generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by
continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device
models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling
machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is
unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this
context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,
preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative
updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor
autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial
tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL
employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and
task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining
lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.
Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an
autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new
task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately
allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without
additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and
THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both
class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system
has been developed to verify its practicality.

*Jinhui Yi,Huan Yan,Haotian Wang,Jian Yuan,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TransPDT是一种基于Transformer的多任务包裹送达时间预测模型，针对混合物流场景中提货对送货时间预测的更大影响，通过捕捉时空依赖性和提货模式，结合路线预测和快递员空间移动规律，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混合物流场景中，快递员同时处理大量送货和少量提货时，提货对快递员决策行为的影响更大，但现有研究未能充分考虑这一点。准确预测送达时间对物流行业至关重要，因此需要解决多种时空因素交织、提货时间要求严格但数量少、快递员空间移动模式未被充分探索的三大挑战。

Method: 提出了TransPDT模型，采用Transformer编码器架构捕捉快递员历史路径和待处理包裹的时空依赖；设计模式记忆模块通过注意力机制学习不平衡数据中的提货模式；将路线预测作为辅助任务，并结合快递员的空间移动规律进行预测。

Result: 在真实工业规模数据集上的实验证明了该方法的优越性。TransPDT已在京东物流内部部署，用于跟踪北京2000多名快递员每日处理数十万包裹的情况。

Conclusion: TransPDT通过多任务学习和结合快递员行为模式，有效解决了混合物流场景中的送达时间预测问题，为物流行业的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics
industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service
guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where
couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup
simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and
delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the
pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the
delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three
main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately
interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups
have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it
challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'
spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,
but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,
a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first
employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal
dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.
Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the
imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as
an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior
courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on
real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A
system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more
than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in
Beijing.

TL;DR: 该论文通过构建基于DQN算法的随机微分延迟方程（SDDE），分析了DQN的理论特性，证明了其与连续系统的收敛性，并解释了经验回放和目标网络在稳定性中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DQN在强化学习中取得了重大突破，但其理论分析仍有限。本文旨在从连续系统的角度理解DQN的核心技术（经验回放和目标网络），并为算法提供理论支持。

Method: 通过构建随机微分延迟方程（SDDE）并估计其与DQN之间的Wasserstein-1距离，利用改进的Lindeberg原理和算子比较方法分析收敛性。

Result: 证明了距离的上界，并表明当步长趋于零时，两者距离收敛于零。延迟项（对应目标网络）对系统稳定性起到了关键作用。

Conclusion: 研究从连续系统的视角为DQN的经验回放和目标网络技术提供了理论解释，增强了算法的理论基础。

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has
brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In
this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based
on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We
provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the
two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us
to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target
network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay
term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the
stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle
and an operator comparison to establish these results.

Motivation: 现有约束OCO方法允许偶尔的安全违规，而本文旨在解决动态约束变化下的严格安全性问题。

Method: 采用原始-对偶方法和在线梯度上升（在双空间中），结合二分学习率以确保安全性和次线性遗憾。

Result: 实现了零约束违反的绝对安全性和次线性遗憾的理论保证。

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个在动态约束OCO中实现绝对安全性的可证明框架，标志着该领域的重大进展。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in
Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic
constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow
for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining
strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely
the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds.
This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in
the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables
ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our
framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable
guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints
in OCO.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为DeepSTA的深度时空注意力模型，用于预测物流行业中快递员的准时送达率，尤其在异常情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物流行业需要提前预测快递员的准时送达率以确保服务正常运行，尤其是在异常事件（如疫情）期间，现有研究对此关注不足且未能有效建模异常事件。

Method: 提出DeepSTA模型，包含异常时空学习模块和异常模式注意力模块，分别利用递归神经网络建模异常事件信息，以及通过注意力机制存储异常特征模式。

Result: 在2022年COVID-19疫情期间的真实物流数据集上，DeepSTA的MAE和MSE分别比最佳基线模型提升12.11%和13.71%。

Conclusion: DeepSTA通过显式建模异常事件和存储异常模式，显著提升了异常情况下快递员准时送达率的预测性能。

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the
logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure
the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical
during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'
delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.
Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many
works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly
model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other
features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous
events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in
these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal
attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we
design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent
neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec
to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks
and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of
couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal
circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a
memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention
mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the
COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by
12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over
multiple competitive baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 骨质疏松因无症状常被忽视，早期预测对预防骨折至关重要，需提高模型的临床可信度。

Method: 评估六种机器学习分类器（如XGBoost、随机森林），并通过GridSearchCV优化超参数，结合SHAP等XAI方法解释模型。

Result: XGBoost表现最佳（准确率91%），年龄是主要风险因素，结果与临床知识一致。

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk
via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a
significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its
asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert
fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting
and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with
the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest
accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision
(0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI
approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to
elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates
that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed
by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate
clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The
research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning
models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on
the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further
research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of
supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

Result: 在合成和真实工业数据集上，CICADA在跨域检测性能和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CICADA通过创新设计解决了跨域异常检测的挑战，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in
applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant
challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which
are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing
models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and
emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce
CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and
Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE)
framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility
and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent
negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion
algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical
attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to
enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and
interpretability.

Conclusion: 交叉注意力与自训练的结合在多模态分类中表现出互补优势，尤其在监管分类任务中能有效提升小样本下的模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for
regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based
multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual
information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates
a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a
self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision.
Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach
achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming
text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard
multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3
percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1,
suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under
limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary
benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety
and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for
training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial
training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within
$\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems
and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region
specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable
logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss
terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In
this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be
unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show
that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general
approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study
involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is
publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting
outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input
signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but
also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics
of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing
transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer
that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The
multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original
transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not
only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions
between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation
in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the
sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and
the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted
by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state
correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD
state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize
actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its
operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve
this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that
concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their
density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe
decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our
proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline
MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization
from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing
interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized
circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron
specialization without compromising language modelling performance.
Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that
self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This
reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where
decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization,
leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make
our code available at

### [114] [Leveraging Partial SMILES Validation Scheme for Enhanced Drug Design in Reinforcement Learning Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00530)
*Xinyu Wang,Jinbo Bi,Minghu Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出PSV-PPO算法，通过实时部分SMILES验证解决分子生成中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持高效探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的分子生成方法（如REINVENT）在RL阶段易出现灾难性遗忘，且缺乏有效探索机制。

Method: 提出PSV-PPO算法，在每一步自回归生成时进行部分SMILES验证，提前检测无效结构分支，避免无效生成。

Result: 在PMO和GuacaMol数据集上，PSV-PPO显著减少无效结构生成，且探索与优化性能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PSV-PPO框架可扩展至其他领域知识，进一步推动强化学习在药物发现中的应用。

Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug
discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)
has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high
matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a
critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL
phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\%
during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied
in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian
pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To
address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a
novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to
prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike
traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after
generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each
auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also
all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables
early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a
result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive
exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol
benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of
invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and
optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining
validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to
incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing
reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

### [115] [Test-time Correlation Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00533)
*Linjing You,Jiabao Lu,Xiayuan Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文针对测试时适应（TTA）中的实例对齐和计算开销问题，提出了基于相关对齐的TCA方法，通过理论分析和两种算法（LinearTCA和LinearTCA+）显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题无法访问训练数据时，现有TTA方法主要关注实例对齐，忽略了相关对齐（CORAL），且模型更新复杂导致计算开销大和域遗忘问题。

Method: 提出了Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA)，通过理论证明高确定性实例与测试实例的相关对齐可提升性能。具体实现为两种算法：不需额外模型更新的LinearTCA（线性变换实现实例和相关对齐），以及可增强现有TTA方法的插件模块LinearTCA+。

Result: 在多个任务和基准测试中，TCA方法显著优于基线，例如在OfficeHome数据集上LinearTCA将适应准确率提升5.88%，同时仅占用最佳基线TTA方法4%的GPU内存和0.6%的计算时间。

Conclusion: TCA通过相关对齐解决了实例对齐的局限性，兼顾性能与效率，为TTA提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution
shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a
solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world
scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),
which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA
methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise
alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source
correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,
resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate
the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that
correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can
enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we
propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.
LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and
correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves
as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive
experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods
significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and
backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on
OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6%
computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KnowEEG是一种可解释的机器学习方法，用于EEG分类，通过融合电极特征和连接性统计，性能优于现有深度学习模型，并提供可解释的特征重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分类中深度学习模型可解释性不足的问题，为医疗等领域提供可解释的高性能EEG分析工具。

Method: 提取电极特征，通过统计测试筛选，结合电极间连接性统计，使用改进的随机森林模型（Fusion Forest）进行分类。

Result: 在情绪检测、脑力负荷分类等五项任务中，KnowEEG性能达到或超越现有深度学习模型，并通过特征重要性提供可解释性。

Conclusion: KnowEEG不仅性能优越，还具备可解释性，能发现并验证神经科学知识，对EEG关键领域如医疗有重要意义。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that
shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification
to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep
learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability
remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce
KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.
KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them
using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity
statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model
(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode
connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating
knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,
KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep
learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,
mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG
classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG
provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for
understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open
classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge
about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed
classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.
Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG
explainability is critical such as healthcare.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DFBT的新方法，直接预测状态以减少延迟RL中的累积误差，并在实验中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中因延迟导致的状态估计误差累积问题，传统递归预测方法易产生误差放大。

Method: 提出DFBT方法，直接从观测预测状态，避免逐步递归预测中间状态。

Result: 在D4RL离线数据集和MuJoCo基准测试中，DFBT显著减少误差并提升性能。

Conclusion: DFBT有效降低了误差累积，提高了学习效率和性能，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions
lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of
its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause
the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel
belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT),
directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating
intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT
greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods,
yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline
datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy.
DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step
bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo
benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过交错循环和对角矩阵分解来降低傅里叶域训练复杂度的方法，减少了浮点运算和可训练参数，同时保持或提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽然在不同领域取得了巨大成功，但其巨大的计算和存储复杂度使得模型难以微调且实用性受限，因此需要一种更高效的微调方法。

Method: 通过交错循环和对角矩阵的乘积来分解傅里叶域的训练权重，避免构建权重变化矩阵，并使用一维快速傅里叶变换（FFT）替代二维FFT，同时处理非方形微调权重的情况。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种任务中实现了相似或更好的性能，同时显著减少了浮点运算（FLOPs）和可训练参数的数量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了傅里叶域训练的复杂度，为更高效的基础模型微调提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains.
However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models
difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows
training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of
both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we
propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the
product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address
the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix
into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and
utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental
results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across
various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number
of trainable parameters.

TL;DR: AiT模型通过自适应线性网络和Transformer模块，解决了不规则多变量时间序列的建模问题，提高了预测准确率并降低了运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的多变量时间序列常存在采样间隔不均和缺失值问题，传统线性网络难以有效建模，因此需要新方法。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，AiT的预测准确率提升11%，运行时间减少52%。

Conclusion: AiT有效解决了不规则多变量时间序列的建模和预测问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various
industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.
Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational
cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing
research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate
time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular
multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and
missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series
asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with
traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these
challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an
adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to
observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby
enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by
incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT
efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of
inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by
11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间分析的核心目标是通过建模空间关系和推断空间过程从空间数据中生成知识。传统方法依赖空间统计，而机器学习提供了可扩展且灵活的替代方案。然而，机器学习的“黑箱”特性限制了对其输出和行为的理解，因此需要XAI方法增强透明性。

Method: 介绍了XAI的关键概念和方法，特别是基于Shapley值的解释技术，并将其与空间分析结合。通过2020年美国总统选举的县级投票行为实证研究，展示了该方法与多尺度地理加权回归的比较。

Result: 证明了Shapley值在空间分析中的有效性，能够增强模型输出透明性，并支持模型诊断和偏差检测。

Conclusion: 尽管XAI技术（如Shapley值）在空间分析中展现出潜力，但仍存在挑战和局限性，未来需探索新方向以进一步提升其应用效果。

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in
spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes
to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on
spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable
and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been
increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine
learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our
understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI
has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the
output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding.
These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the
reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter
introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based
approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their
integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting
behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use
of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale
geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on
the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new
directions.

Method: 采用四种攻击算法和三种防御策略，评估五种GFMs的对抗鲁棒性，分析模型架构、量化方案和训练数据的影响。

Result: Transformer架构的GFMs对对抗扰动更稳健；攻击常针对生物学重要的基因组区域，表明模型能有效捕捉序列特征。

Conclusion: GERM为GFMs的对抗脆弱性提供了首个全面基准，揭示了架构设计的重要性，并证实模型能学习有生物学意义的特征。

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic
Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM
offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess
the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate
the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely
adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our
benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM
vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and
training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater
robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the
impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Conclusion: 对比学习在多组学数据中具有潜力，能够增强生物学见解的发现能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a
significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce
OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds
heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and
miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a
survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn
representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on
labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers
clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance
with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across
hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype
coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating
survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned
embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for
biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

TL;DR: Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO) 是一种用于连续动作空间的强化学习算法，结合了确定性策略梯度和经典策略梯度的优点，无需重参数化技巧，并在实验中获得优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决连续动作空间中强化学习算法的通用性问题，同时避免重参数化技巧的限制，WPO引入Wasserstein梯度流的近似优化策略。

Method: WPO通过将策略空间投影到有限维参数空间（如神经网络权重），推导出封闭式更新公式，既能利用动作值函数的梯度，又适用于任何随机策略。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和磁约束聚变任务上的实验表明，WPO性能优于当前最先进的连续控制方法。

Conclusion: WPO提供了一种简单通用的强化学习框架，结合了确定性和随机策略梯度的优势，展现了在复杂任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm
for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as
an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies
projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a
neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update.
The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic
policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits
knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the
action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies
with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the
reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a
magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art
continuous control methods.

Conclusion: MINERVA数据集填补了视频推理评估的空白，为模型能力分析提供了细粒度工具。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most
video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or
interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models
are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about
videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic
biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA
for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer
choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is
multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of
complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset
provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We
perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across
various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to
explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning
traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal
localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or
completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and
reasoning traces will be publicly available under

Conclusion: 正态归一化不仅适用于现有归一化层的场景，还显著提升了模型对随机扰动的鲁棒性，为神经网络归一化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at
the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the
greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an
equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions.
Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of
deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their
effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what
distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved,
been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal
distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality
normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the
feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and
employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments
comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in
regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and
dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of
variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its
suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally
used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical
developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their
technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying
theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,
especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose
a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the
technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic
feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing
contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents
to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical
Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy
methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative
paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving
equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a
forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.
Together, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of

Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in
particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of
the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this
anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as
found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined
with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities,
relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is
then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are
given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of
relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is
proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and
diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in
pediatric imaging, enabling surgeons to plan surgery.

Result: 企业研究偏向预部署（模型对齐、测试评估），部署阶段问题（如偏见）关注减少；高风险领域（医疗、金融等）研究不足。

Conclusion: 需提升部署数据的可观测性，扩大外部研究者对部署数据的访问，以弥补知识缺口并促进AI安全发展。

Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI
papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI
companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI
universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of
Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on
pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while
attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant
research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare,
finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and
copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate
concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external
researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market
AI behaviors.

*Sumit Verma,Pritam Prasun,Arpit Jaiswal,Pritish Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用RAIL框架的系统方法，通过八个可衡量的维度评估大型语言模型的伦理行为，并在Anthropic的数据集上进行了实证分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI伦理框架缺乏可操作的评价方法，需要一种系统化的方式来评估AI系统的伦理表现。

Method: 采用RAIL框架，包含八个可衡量维度，应用于Anthropic的308,000条匿名对话数据集和3,000多条标注的价值表述。

Result: 通过将价值映射到RAIL维度并计算综合分数，揭示了LLM在现实应用中的伦理行为表现。

Conclusion: RAIL框架提供了一种有效的工具来评估和改善AI系统的伦理表现，填补了现有框架的不足。

Abstract: As AI systems become embedded in real-world applications, ensuring they meet
ethical standards is crucial. While existing AI ethics frameworks emphasize
fairness, transparency, and accountability, they often lack actionable
evaluation methods. This paper introduces a systematic approach using the
Responsible AI Labs (RAIL) framework, which includes eight measurable
dimensions to assess the normative behavior of large language models (LLMs). We
apply this framework to Anthropic's "Values in the Wild" dataset, containing
over 308,000 anonymized conversations with Claude and more than 3,000 annotated
value expressions. Our study maps these values to RAIL dimensions, computes
synthetic scores, and provides insights into the ethical behavior of LLMs in
real-world use.

### [130] [DeCo: Defect-Aware Modeling with Contrasting Matching for Optimizing Task Assignment in Online IC Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00278)
*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Yu-Hao Chiang,Yi-Tung Tsai,Hsu-Chao Lai,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DeCo方法，通过构建缺陷感知图和对比机制优化IC测试任务分配，实验表明其任务处理成功率达80%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视缺陷特征、历史故障和工程师经验的整合，限制了IC处理效率的提升，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: DeCo通过构建缺陷感知图捕获故障关系，结合工程师和任务的表征建模，采用对比机制分配任务。

Result: 实验显示DeCo任务处理成功率超80%，并能均衡工作量，即使工程师对某些缺陷不熟悉也能高效分配。

Conclusion: DeCo是IC故障分析和任务处理的AI驱动解决方案，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital
role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements
in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right
engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies
emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the
integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights
from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC
handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative
approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel
defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships
to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally,
it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced
by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a
contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by
considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable
and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different
scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both
scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can
assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar
defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world
IC failure analysis and task handling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CognitionNet的两阶段深度神经网络，用于从在线游戏数据中挖掘玩家行为模式和游戏风格，以揭示玩家心理和战术决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏数据可以反映玩家的心理状态和行为模式，通过挖掘这些数据可以更好地理解玩家的行为、体验和保护需求。

Method: CognitionNet分为两个阶段：第一阶段通过聚类潜在空间中的表示来挖掘游戏行为；第二阶段通过监督分类目标聚合这些微模式以发现游戏风格。使用了一种新颖的“桥接损失”方法来协同训练两个网络。

Result: CognitionNet在定义一致的游戏风格方面表现优异，显著优于现有基线方法，并首次实现了从遥测数据中自动化发现玩家心理和战术的目标。

Conclusion: 该研究为从游戏数据中挖掘玩家心理和行为模式提供了一种创新的自动化方法，并展示了其在理解和预测玩家行为方面的潜力。

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at
the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in,
e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is
rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help
create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her
impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this
knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted
player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards
players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on
discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous
sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a
sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We
propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses
on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while
the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a
supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual
objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired
decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and
one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player
psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic
explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of
the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel
formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining
homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms
the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Muhammad Ashfaq,Niko Mäkitalo,Tommi Mikkonen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的智能整体架构，用于解决城市空中交通（UAM）中的复杂性和动态协调问题，并通过案例研究展示了其高效性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构在应对城市空中交通系统的可扩展性、适应性和资源整合方面存在不足，需要一个更灵活和分散的解决方案来管理动态环境中的复杂任务。

Method: 采用智能整体架构和LLM技术，使各部分半自主运行，实现实时协调，并通过自然语言处理生成自适应计划和处理突发情况（如天气变化）。

Result: 案例研究表明，该架构支持动态资源分配、实时重规划和自主适应，无需集中控制即可提升城市交通网络的弹性和效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为分散控制和AI驱动的适应性提供了基础，未来将探索混合AI集成和实际环境验证，以构建更具韧性和以人为本的UAM生态系统。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces
challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution.
Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability,
and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This
paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large
Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi
autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground
transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate
adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace
closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric
scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic
resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without
centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation
networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this
work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with
future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.

*Jing Huang,Zhixiong Zeng,Wenkang Han,Yufeng Zhong,Liming Zheng,Shuai Fu,Jingyuan Chen,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ScaleTrack是一种自动化GUI代理的训练框架，通过扩展GUI坐标绑定和回溯历史行为的规划来提升任务执行能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在坐标绑定阶段缺乏足够训练数据，且在规划阶段忽略回溯历史行为，导致任务执行效果受限。

Method: ScaleTrack通过多源GUI样本的统一模板训练坐标绑定模型，并设计回溯规划策略，从当前GUI图像预测下一动作并关联历史行为。

Result: 实验验证了ScaleTrack的有效性，成功建模了GUI环境与动作的演化规则。

Conclusion: ScaleTrack通过增强数据多样性和回溯规划，显著提升了GUI代理的任务执行能力。

Abstract: Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically
performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop
devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate
executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.
Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which
the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the
task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on
historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of
insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of
backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above
challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding
and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI
samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and
unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.
Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action
from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that
led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence
between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules
of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.

Conclusion: UserCentrix框架有效增强了智能空间的动态决策和资源优化能力。

Abstract: Agentic AI, with its autonomous and proactive decision-making, has
transformed smart environments. By integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and
multi-agent systems, modern AI frameworks can dynamically adapt to user
preferences, optimize data management, and improve resource allocation. This
paper introduces UserCentrix, an agentic memory-augmented AI framework designed
to enhance smart spaces through dynamic, context-aware decision-making. This
framework integrates personalized Large Language Model (LLM) agents that
leverage user preferences and LLM memory management to deliver proactive and
adaptive assistance. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid hierarchical control
system, balancing centralized and distributed processing to optimize real-time
responsiveness while maintaining global situational awareness. UserCentrix
achieves resource-efficient AI interactions by embedding memory-augmented
reasoning, cooperative agent negotiation, and adaptive orchestration
strategies. Our key contributions include (i) a self-organizing framework with
proactive scaling based on task urgency, (ii) a Value of Information
(VoI)-driven decision-making process, (iii) a meta-reasoning personal LLM
agent, and (iv) an intelligent multi-agent coordination system for seamless
environment adaptation. Experimental results across various models confirm the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing response accuracy, system
efficiency, and computational resource management in real-world application.

Motivation: 现有的法律分类器框架仅依赖事实特征，但法律推理需结合规则（如判例依据）。本文旨在弥补这一差距，构建更完整的法律推理模型。

Method: 基于Canavotto等人（2023）的规则推理模型，扩展分类器框架以纳入规则集，并结合时间因素和法院层级进行推断。

Result: 提出的框架能够更准确地推断新案例的判决，并证明了时间因素和法院层级在法律分类中的实用性。

Conclusion: 通过将事实与规则结合，新的分类器框架提升了法律推理的全面性，为法律AI应用提供了更可靠的模型基础。

Abstract: We extend the formal framework of classifier models used in the legal domain.
While the existing classifier framework characterises cases solely through the
facts involved, legal reasoning fundamentally relies on both facts and rules,
particularly the ratio decidendi. This paper presents an initial approach to
incorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work
of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of
precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how
decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based
classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time
element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier
framework.

### [136] [Can LLMs Help Improve Analogical Reasoning For Strategic Decisions? Experimental Evidence from Humans and GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00603)
*Phanish Puranam,Prothit Sen,Maciej Workiewicz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT4在类比推理中高召回但低精度，人类则高精度低召回；AI错误源于表层匹配，人类错误源于因果误解；AI生成类比，人类评估应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究GPT4是否能在战略决策的类比推理中媲美人类，比较两者在深度结构相似性识别上的差异。

Method: 采用源目标匹配实验设计，对比GPT4与人类在类比推理中的表现。

Result: GPT4召回率高但精度低，人类精度高但召回率低；AI错误主要由表层相似性引起，人类错误由因果误解导致。

Conclusion: AI适合生成类比，人类适合评估应用，两者结合可优化战略决策中的类比推理。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can
match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision
making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target
matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible
analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect
analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants
exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with
stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying
matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that
requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs
are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative
advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error
analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas
human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together,
the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted
organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy
generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most
contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.

TL;DR: 为了解决AI在序列规划中缺乏信任的问题，研究者设计了一个基于计算树逻辑的大型语言模型（LLM）框架，为蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法生成自然语言解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对MCTS难以解释的问题，提出一种灵活的框架，以增强用户对其决策过程的理解和信任。

Method: 通过将用户查询转化为逻辑和变量陈述，利用LLM框架处理MCTS和MDP相关的自然语言查询。

Result: 定量评估表明，该框架在准确性和事实一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升MCTS的可解释性，尤其在复杂搜索树和随机控制过程中表现突出。

Abstract: In response to the lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
sequential planning, we design a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language
model (LLM)-based natural language explanation framework designed for the Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is often considered challenging to
interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is
flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and
knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and
variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the
search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental
dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We
evaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it
demonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.

Motivation: 传统ML评估方法在应对现代生成式AI模型时表现不足，急需新的评估策略以解决输入输出空间无限、缺乏真实目标及强反馈循环等问题。

Method: 提出借鉴AI竞赛中的防泄漏措施和实践，将这些标准作为生成式AI评估的严谨基础。

Result: AI竞赛的防泄漏方法为解决生成式AI评估中的关键问题提供了有效方案，其标准应被视为评估的黄金标准。

Conclusion: 生成式AI领域应将AI竞赛的严格标准作为评估基准，并充分利用其成果以提升评估的严谨性。

Abstract: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI
is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking
strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models
and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these
models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do
not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong
feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model
outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em
leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult
issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI
Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage
for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition
setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized)
resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold
standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest
their results with according value.

Motivation: 解决现有集中式IoV方案的高延迟、低扩展性和对专有AI模型的依赖问题，同时探索LLMs在车辆系统中的优化和应用。

Method: 提出FPoTT框架，结合动态提示优化机制和双层次联邦学习，利用开源LLMs（如EleutherAI Pythia-1B）和Transformer生成合成数据。

Result: 在真实数据上达到99.86%的预测准确率，并在合成数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: FPoTT展示了开源LLMs在安全、自适应和可扩展的IoV管理中的潜力，为智能交通生态系统提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and
privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often
suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to
widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive
environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular
systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and
effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel
framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT
introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines
textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a
dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for
real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A
Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training
with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation
(NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing
EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data
while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results
underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and
scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary
solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of
geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs
allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can
benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better
performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature
extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on
the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data
compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source
anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is
demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets
of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches
in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology
and artificial intelligence in Africa.

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step
responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but
remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and
formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM
multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When
dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive
error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated
failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The
best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents
but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below
random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to
achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and
the need for further research in this area. Code and dataset are available at

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging
systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is
periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a
domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,
this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands
compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By
developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated
into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and
autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach
that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This
led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit
encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which
agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment
without the need for explicit communication between agents.

Motivation: 数据可视化不仅需要技术熟练，还需理解数据的领域背景。然而，数据集本身通常缺乏对这些隐含知识（如数据来源、质量和用途）的明确记录。

Method: 开发了‘Data Therapist’工具，结合大语言模型分析数据集，通过问答和注释引导用户外显化隐含知识，形成结构化知识库。

Result: 在分子生物学、会计、政治科学和可用性安全等领域的专家研究中，工具揭示了专家如何理解数据，并展示了AI支持可视化设计的潜力。

Conclusion: ‘Data Therapist’通过有效外显化领域专家的隐含知识，为数据可视化设计提供了新的支持和改进方向。

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also
a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This
context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and
intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the
Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this
implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A
with interactive annotation. Powered by a large language model, the system
analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and
allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured
knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We
evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular
Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security. The study revealed
recurring patterns in how experts reason about their data and highlights areas
where AI support can improve visualization design.

### [144] [Optimization of embeddings storage for RAG systems using quantization and dimensionality reduction techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00105)
*Naamán Huerga-Pérez,Rubén Álvarez,Rubén Ferrero-Guillén,Alberto Martínez-Gutiérrez,Javier Díez-González*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文研究了在检索增强生成中优化高维向量嵌入存储的方法，包括量化和降维技术，发现float8量化和PCA结合在存储压缩和性能保持上表现最佳。建议可视化性能-存储权衡空间以找到最优配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维向量嵌入在检索增强生成中存储开销大，需要优化存储策略以解决内存挑战。

Method: 系统评估量化和降维技术，量化包括float16、int8、float8等格式，降维包括PCA、Kernel PCA等方法。

Result: float8量化在4倍压缩时性能损失最小（<0.3%），结合50% PCA可实现8倍压缩且性能优于仅用int8。

Conclusion: float8与PCA结合是最佳方案，并通过可视化方法协助实际应用中的配置选择。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving
relevant information from external knowledge bases, relying on high-dimensional
vector embeddings typically stored in float32 precision. However, storing these
embeddings at scale presents significant memory challenges. To address this
issue, we systematically investigate on MTEB benchmark two complementary
optimization strategies: quantization, evaluating standard formats (float16,
int8, binary) and low-bit floating-point types (float8), and dimensionality
reduction, assessing methods like PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, Random Projections and
Autoencoders. Our results show that float8 quantization achieves a 4x storage
reduction with minimal performance degradation (<0.3%), significantly
outperforming int8 quantization at the same compression level, being simpler to
implement. PCA emerges as the most effective dimensionality reduction
technique. Crucially, combining moderate PCA (e.g., retaining 50% dimensions)
with float8 quantization offers an excellent trade-off, achieving 8x total
compression with less performance impact than using int8 alone (which provides
only 4x compression). To facilitate practical application, we propose a
methodology based on visualizing the performance-storage trade-off space to
identify the optimal configuration that maximizes performance within their
specific memory constraints.

TL;DR: 《EnronQA》是一个用于评估和优化RAG（检索增强生成）管道的基准测试数据集，包含103,638封电子邮件和528,304对问答对，旨在支持个性化、隐私化的RAG技术发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为现有的RAG基准测试多使用公开数据，缺乏对个性化、隐私化数据的覆盖，无法有效支持企业级的RAG应用。因此，作者提出了EnronQA基准测试，以改进私人文档上的RAG性能评估。

Method: 作者发布了EnronQA数据集，包含大量真实电子邮件和问答对，以模拟私人文档的处理场景。同时，实验研究了记忆化和检索在私人文档推理中的权衡。

Result: EnronQA为评估RAG管道在隐私数据上的表现提供了更好的基准，并支持个性化检索设置的实验。研究发现，记忆与检索在私人文档推理中存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: EnronQA填补了RAG基准测试在个性化、隐私化数据上的空白，为企业在私人数据上的RAG应用提供了有效的评估工具和支持。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular
methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM)
because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the
cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of
private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many
enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's
understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for
private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for
validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data
such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.
Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA
benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs
across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG
pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction
of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA
to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over
private documents.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Task Arithmetic的技术，通过简单的数学运算结合不同任务或领域的LLMs权重，无需额外微调即可适应检索任务。实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在零样本任务中表现优异，但在未见过的任务和领域上性能下降，原因是词汇和词分布的差异。作者旨在通过Task Arithmetic技术解决这一问题，无需微调即可适应不同检索任务。

Method: Task Arithmetic通过数学运算（如加减）结合预训练的LLMs权重，将多样化的任务和领域知识整合到一个模型中，实现零样本适应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在科学、生物医学和多语言数据集上的NDCG@10和P@10指标分别提升了18%和15%，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Task Arithmetic是一种有效的零样本学习和模型适应策略，尽管其有局限性，但在检索任务中表现优异。作者公开了代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document
re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,
largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we
investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs
pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,
such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring
additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and
domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation
in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available
scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves
state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in
P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into
the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for
zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at

*Chanwoo Kim,Jinkyu Sung,Yebonn Han,Joonseok Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ChebyCF是一个基于图谱过滤的协同过滤框架，解决了传统图卷积网络在推荐系统中的瓶颈问题，通过利用完整的信号频谱和灵活的Chebyshev插值实现了高效推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图卷积网络在推荐系统中存在两个主要瓶颈：嵌入层导致潜在空间容量有限，以及邻域聚合方法无法细粒度利用多样化的偏好模式。

Method: 采用图谱过滤技术，直接使用用户的原始交互历史，通过Chebyshev插值逼近非线性图滤波器，并结合理想通滤波器和基于度数的归一化。

Result: 实验表明，ChebyCF克服了上述瓶颈，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并且推理速度较快。

Conclusion: ChebyCF通过创新的图谱过滤方法提升了推荐系统的性能，展现了在复杂偏好模式处理上的优势。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative
filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks
in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent
space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially
valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is
limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a
fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these
limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum
and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a
CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,
it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of
signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively
approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by
using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through
extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned
bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.

*Jacob Carlson,Melissa Dell*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个通用的框架MARS，用于从非结构化数据中高效且稳健地推断参数，通过将非结构化数据重构为缺失的结构化数据问题，结合半参数推断理论，解决深度学习预测中的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习在非结构化数据（如文本、图像、音频和视频）分析中的广泛应用，其预测可能存在偏差，进而影响基于这些输出的估计量。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过将非结构化数据视为缺失的结构化数据问题，并利用深度神经网络填充，结合半参数推断理论，提出了MARS框架，用于生成稳健且高效的估计量。

Result: MARS框架不仅提供了对描述性和因果性估计量的稳健高效估计，还解决了现有文献中未充分关注的常见问题，并在实际案例中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过整合和扩展现有方法，为非结构化数据推断提供了通用且实用的解决方案，填补了现有研究的空白，并在实际应用中展示了显著价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust
inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text,
images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from
texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with
advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not
generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to
estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe
inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where
structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural
networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from
semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators
based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At
Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends
existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions,
linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference.
We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal
estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and
transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to
common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing
literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data,
demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

Motivation: 为使结构模型对研究者更易用，提出预训练估计器以减少后续应用的计算成本和人力投入。

Method: 利用神经网络识别结构模型的参数，构建适用于顺序搜索模型的预训练估计器。

Result: 在14个真实数据集上测试，估计速度快且准确性高。

Conclusion: 预训练即用型估计器能提升结构模型的适用性，促进研究和实践中的应用。

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The
estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost
and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator.
Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little
computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net
to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial
trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model
that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator
on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high
accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,
pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible
to researchers and practitioners.

Motivation: 由于神经网络（NNs）在复杂生物数据建模中表现强大但缺乏可解释性，论文旨在通过MI技术提升NNs在生物统计因果推断中的可靠性和可解释性。

Method: 研究利用MI工具验证NNs学习的内在表示（如TMLE框架中的干扰函数），可视化其输入处理的计算路径，并比较统计、机器学习和NN模型的机制。

Result: MI技术成功揭示NNs如何处理混杂变量和治疗变量，验证了其内部表示，并提供了跨模型比较的方法论。

Conclusion: MI技术为NNs在生物统计因果推断中的应用提供了可解释性和验证工具，增强了其在健康高风险场景中的可信度。

Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in
bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical
statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While
Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex
biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for
validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in
Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations
learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI
techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the
internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance
functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)
discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the
network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how
confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for
comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,
machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their
respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.

Motivation: 从高维多组学数据中识别COVID-19的关键生物标志物对于诊断和发病机制研究至关重要。研究旨在评估QSVM算法在此类任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用岭回归对蛋白质组和代谢组生物标志物进行重要性排序，并将其分为高排名和低排名组。随后分别用经典SVM（CSVM）和QSVM（包括多种量子核）训练模型并比较性能。

Result: QSVM在多种实验设置下的分类性能与CSVM相当或更优，且能反映岭回归的重要性排序。尽管实验在数值模拟中完成，结果仍显示出QSVM在生物医学研究中的潜力。

Conclusion: QSVM是一种有前景的多组学数据分析方法，未来可进一步探索其在真实生物医学场景中的应用。

Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics
data is critical for advancing both diagnostic and pathogenesis research. In
this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector
Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19.
Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked
by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and
bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both
classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative
control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum
kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and
the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM
consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or
exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge
regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation,
our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for
multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典技术有望提升欺诈检测系统的效率与性能，为金融风险分析提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for
fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena
such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature
representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear
patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data
preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a
credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models.
Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of
45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures
reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes
per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a
unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the
quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a
conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid

Result: 实验表明，QLSTM优化器在Max-Cut和Sherrington-Kirkpatrick模型中收敛更快，且近似比优于经典基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为NISQ时代下的可扩展量子优化提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) promise efficient
solutions to classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems by
harnessing shallow-depth quantum circuits. Yet, their performance and
scalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains
nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we
introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural
networks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures,
with QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our
approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially
reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through
comprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
instances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and
achieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby
offering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的快速发展带来了仇恨模因的滥用问题，现有方法在检测仇恨内容方面已有研究，但有效缓解仇恨内容仍具挑战性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型(VLMs)的生成和推理能力，提出定义引导的提示技术和UnHateMeme框架，通过替换仇恨组件来转化内容。

Result: VLMs在仇恨模因检测任务中表现优异，UnHateMeme框架能有效将仇恨模因转化为非仇恨形式，同时保持多模态连贯性。

Conclusion: 研究表明VLMs在确保在线环境安全方面具有重要应用潜力，并分析了LLaVA、Gemini和GPT-4o等模型的优劣势。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication
channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express
their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or
humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to
disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of
hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform
hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the
powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This
paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting
technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for
mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing
hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,
VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task.
Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a
strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet
human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between
image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of
state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the
proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective
strengths and limitations for these tasks. This paper aims to shed light on
important applications of VLMs for ensuring safe and respectful online
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分析系统局限于预定义任务，缺乏开放性分析能力。视频语言模型（VLM）虽有潜力，但受限于上下文窗口长度，难以处理超长视频内容。

Method: AVA采用两种创新技术：(1)构建事件知识图（EKG）实现长视频高效索引，(2)基于EKG的代理检索生成机制支持复杂查询。

Result: 在LVBench和VideoMME-Long基准测试中，AVA分别达到62.3%和64.1%的准确率；在AVS-100（新提出的超长视频基准）上，准确率为75.8%。

Conclusion: AVA通过结合EKG和代理检索生成机制，显著提升了开放环境下超长视频分析的性能，为未来视频分析系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse
domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,
predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical
scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as
transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling
open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their
limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video
content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we
introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video
analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time
construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or
continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism
that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that
AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,
respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video
analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new
benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours
in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex
question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an
accuracy of 75.8%.

TL;DR: Pack-PTQ 是一种新颖的后训练量化方法，通过Hessian引导的自适应分组机制保留跨块依赖关系，并采用混合精度量化进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ方法忽视了跨块依赖性，在低比特情况下精度下降明显。

Method: 设计了Hessian引导的自适应分组机制，将块划分为不重叠的分组作为重建基础；提出混合精度量化方法，为不同敏感度的分组分配不同比特宽度。

Result: 在2D图像和3D点云分类任务中，采用不同网络架构的实验表明，Pack-PTQ优于现有PTQ方法。

Conclusion: Pack-PTQ有效解决了跨块依赖性问题和低比特精度下降问题，显著提升了量化性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for
compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and
avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ
block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a
notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a
Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into
non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby
preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization
parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a
mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs
according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing
performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud
classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for
better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic
segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming
systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and
October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of
Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of
Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP)
vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field
boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with
UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date
images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of
IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack
approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using
pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan.
Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary
data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the
Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide
additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the
season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground
information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and
universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also
highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field
boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to
multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation
in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

*Xinlong Zhao,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FGSTP的算法，用于高效准确地检测和分割气体泄漏，解决了传统方法难以应对隐蔽和随机形状泄漏的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气体泄漏对人类健康和环境构成重大风险，但现有方法难以高效准确地检测和分割这些隐蔽且形状随机的泄漏。

Method: 提出FGSTP算法，通过构建相关体积捕获连续帧间的运动信息，逐步细化对象级特征，并利用解码器优化边界分割。

Result: 在自建数据集GasVid上的实验表明，FGSTP在非刚性物体（如气体泄漏）分割上优于其他SOTA模型，生成最准确的掩码。

Conclusion: FGSTP算法在气体泄漏分割任务中表现出色，为解决这一难题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite
long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and
accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and
random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal
Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical
motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in
an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to
capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained
perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous
outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.
Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,
we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on
GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such
as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习和贝叶斯序数分类的自动放疗轮廓质量评估方法，通过不确定性量化减少人工审查需求，提高临床决策效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线自适应放疗（OART）中，自动生成的轮廓需要高效的质量评估方法以减少人工负担并确保安全性。

Method: 结合贝叶斯序数分类（BOC）模型和校准不确定性阈值，支持无标注、有限标注和充足标注三种数据场景。

Result: 模型在所有场景下表现稳健，仅需少量标注（30例）即可达到90%以上准确率，93%的预测质量可信度超98%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了OART轮廓效率，通过减少人工干预和量化不确定性优化放疗流程。

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment
(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in
radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging
Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,
the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth
contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to
classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A
calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical
accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual
labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate
cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,
transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were
available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all
scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34
subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated
threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted
in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting
cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring
efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed
clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more
reliable radiotherapy workflows.

### [160] [Efficient Neural Video Representation with Temporally Coherent Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00335)
*Seungjun Shin,Suji Kim,Dokwan Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NVTM的新型框架，通过时空分解和流信息处理，显著提高了视频表示的训练速度和参数效率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的隐式神经表示(INR)在视频应用中存在训练速度慢和参数效率低的问题，尤其是网格型编码方法忽略了视频的动态特性，导致冗余参数和高比特率。

Method: NVTM通过将时空3D视频数据分解为带有流信息的2D网格集，高效学习视频表示，实现了快速的编码速度和高参数效率。

Result: 与NeRV风格方法相比，NVTM的编码速度提升了3倍以上，并在UVG和MCL-JCV数据集上分别实现了平均1.54dB/0.019和1.84dB/0.013的PSNR/LPIPS提升。在视频压缩任务中，性能与H.264和HEVC标准相当。

Conclusion: NVTM通过动态特性捕获和高效参数利用，显著提升了视频表示的速度和性能，适用于多种视频处理任务。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications
across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up
training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art
approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a
faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid
usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant
use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter
efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a
parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video
representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework
that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the
spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,
NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter
efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels
at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video
quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed
increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019
improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)
and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),
compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,
we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,
HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform
extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm
across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and
video inpainting. Project page is https://sujiikim.github.io/NVTM/.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于点轨迹自动编码的新方法，用于评估视频生成模型的运动质量，比传统FVD方法更敏感，并能预测人类对视频真实性和时间一致性的评价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型常生成看似合理但运动质量差的帧，传统评价方法（如FVD）无法有效捕捉这一问题。因此，需要一种更好的指标来衡量对象交互和运动的合理性。

Method: 采用点轨迹自动编码技术，提取运动特征，用于比较视频分布或单视频的运动质量。相比像素重建或动作识别特征，点轨迹对时间失真更敏感。

Result: 新方法能更准确地预测人类对视频真实性和时间一致性的评价，并能时空定位视频生成中的不一致性，提供更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于点轨迹的指标显著优于现有方法，为视频生成模型的评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate
plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured
by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go
beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object
interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point
tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare
distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as
many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show
that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition
features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal
distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal
consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models
better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point
track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video
inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors
relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be

Conclusion: T2I-R1通过双层CoT与RL的结合有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

Motivation: 研究旨在利用先进的扩散变压器架构，通过联合RGB和深度的分布建模，实现高质量的图像生成与几何准确的深度图生成，同时探索联合分布建模在多任务生成中的潜力。

Method: 提出两种关键技术：自适应调度权重（根据每种模态的噪声水平调整权重）和不平衡时间步采样策略（分别为不同模态训练所有噪声水平），从而在一个模型中同时处理联合生成、深度估计和深度条件图像生成。

Result: JointDiT在联合生成任务中表现优异，同时在深度估计和深度条件图像生成任务中达到了可比较的结果，证明了联合分布建模是条件生成的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: JointDiT通过简单而有效的技术实现了RGB和深度的联合分布建模，展示了强大的多任务生成能力，为未来的联合模态生成研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint
distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional
generation. The project page is available at

Motivation: 超分辨率在计算机视觉中应用广泛，但现有深度学习方法在高倍放大时难以平衡细节与结构保真度。扩散模型虽有效，仍需改进条件处理机制。

Method: 整合四元数小波预处理与潜在扩散模型，引入四元数小波和时间感知编码器，动态嵌入小波信息于去噪过程，并利用Stable Diffusion等基础模型的生成先验。

Result: 在领域特定数据集上的实验显示，该方法在感知质量和标准指标上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: ResQu框架通过创新的小波嵌入和扩散模型结合，显著提升了超分辨率的重建质量，为高倍放大任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad
applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for
enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While
deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality
reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains
challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches
leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often
struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,
we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet
preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new
quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply
apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the
conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are
dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also
leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.
Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing
approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will
be available after the revision process.

<details>

Motivation: 由于多模态MRI数据在实际应用中常因采集问题或专家缺失而缺少某些模态，传统方法需为每种模态组合单独训练模型，资源消耗大且不实用。

Method: 提出BM-MAE，一种基于掩码图像建模的预训练策略，通过同一预训练模型适应任何模态组合，捕获模态内和模态间信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于或媲美需为每种模态子集单独预训练的基线，并在下游任务中显著超越从头训练的方法，还能高效重建缺失模态。

Conclusion: BM-MAE为多模态MRI数据提供了一种高效、灵活的预训练方案，具有显著的临床实用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To
this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers
which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization
of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO
foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate
prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face
datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over
1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a
FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the
uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new
benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity
facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark
is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,
our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of
geometric accuracy for posed facial expressions.

Result: 在SICAPv2和APTOS数据集上，UMKD在源域和目标域不平衡场景下均达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: UMKD为实际医疗图像分级任务提供了一种高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial
intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient
assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance,
introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical
applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple
expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract
discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific
features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At
the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism
dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model
uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD
also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution
discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled
by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading
(\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that
UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and
target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for
real-world disease image grading.

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated
with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on
self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.
This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by
leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and
pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,
allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments
with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.
Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition
challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The
3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary
behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and
accurate dietary monitoring tools.

due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于GUI图像的视觉复杂性和大量界面元素，理解网页内容并精确选择动作具有挑战性，因此需要一种动态缩放相关区域的方法以提升准确性。

Method: 提出了RegionFocus方法，采用动态缩放相关区域以及图像作为地图的机制，可视化关键地标，帮助代理更透明地记录动作并有效选择候选动作。

Result: 在Screenspot-pro和WebVoyager基准测试中，性能分别提升了28%和24%，并在Qwen2.5-VL-72B模型上达到了61.6%的最新接地性能。

Conclusion: RegionFocus通过视觉测试时间缩放显著提升了语言视觉模型代理的性能，证明了其在交互式场景中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision
Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual
complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making
accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on
relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.
To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes
key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables
the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple
region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on
Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two
state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,
highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive
settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on
the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.
Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.

Motivation: 研究如何在多跳MIMO网络中高效实现机器学习任务，克服传统方法在功率约束和复杂信道环境下的局限性。

Method: 设计PrototypeNet神经网络，其全连接层神经元数对应终端天线数，通过定制损失函数（分类误差和潜在向量功率）训练网络，并引入噪声。预编码矩阵通过优化问题求解，提出多块扩展以应对天线数限制。

Conclusion: 该框架为多跳MIMO网络中的机器学习任务提供了高效解决方案，尤其在功率受限场景下表现出色，且多跳结构进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input
and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate
fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by
carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural
network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with
the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the
corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train
PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification
error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints,
with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then
obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block
extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that
the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory
classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that
higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of
hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Motivation: 当前深度学习方法（如GNN）在材料科学中虽然预测能力强，但缺乏物理可解释性。为了弥补这一不足，作者希望开发一种既能保持预测精度又能提供物理解释的新框架。

Method: 研究者提出了SA-GAT-SR方法，通过自适应的图注意力网络筛选关键特征，并结合符号回归生成紧凑的解析表达式，揭示了量子力学意义上的关系。

Result: 该方法在180维特征空间中高效筛选特征，保持了O(n)计算复杂度，且相比传统符号回归实现了23倍的加速，同时提供了物理解释。

Conclusion: SA-GAT-SR在计算材料科学中架起了预测精度与物理可解释性之间的桥梁，为理解材料行为提供了新工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of
deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for
high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling
enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While
the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and
universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack
physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we
introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention
Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically
combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of
symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm
that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen
critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while
maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently
distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly
reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times
acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on
first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a
new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between
predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical
insights into material behavior.

Abstract: This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an
analytical study of a dataset using the DeepMIMO emulator. An advertorial
attack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A
comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of
detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of
the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks,
during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is
shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an
increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2
indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively
identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression
machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, but rapid
analysis of network traffic and data transmitted over the network makes it

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络的量子态（NQS）在处理复杂量子多体系统时计算成本高昂，且难以泛化到大规模系统和多样化参数区域，因此需要一种更高效的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的课程学习框架，结合物理先验知识，并通过Pairing-Net架构在强关联电子系统中实际应用。

Result: 实现了约200倍的计算加速，并显著提高了优化的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高效探索量子多体系统的大参数空间提供了可行方案，并为物理知识的灵活结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled
high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as
strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains
prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction
strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning
has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to
large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on
transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration
across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by
interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate
how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum
learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically
implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and
empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately
200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization
stability compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to
solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of
experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and
computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM
emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time
intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence
(AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is
featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large
models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks.
However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over
wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial
communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of
edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of
edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management.
Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training
frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to
enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we
investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on
channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and
applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

Motivation: 传统基于矩形图像块的注意力机制在表示复杂度上较高，而proto-objects作为共享视觉属性的图像区域，能够提供更高层次的语义信息，从而降低复杂度并提升效率。

Method: 通过图像分割提取proto-objects，将其编码为紧凑的特征向量，并设计了一个更小的自注意力模块来处理这些特征。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于proto-objects的方法在视觉强化学习任务中性能与现有最佳方法相当或更优，同时参数减少了62%，训练时间缩短了2.6倍。

Conclusion: proto-objects作为注意力机制的基础，能够有效降低表示复杂度，提升语义信息处理效率，是一种有潜力的替代方案。

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a
promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on
rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work
demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a
controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual
reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work
with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed
patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image
decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object
can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a
substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic
information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach
matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based
implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in
reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured
confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy
evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and
assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel
identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value
for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this
identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a
policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that
maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound
of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world
application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methodology.

Conclusion: 通过跨任务学习整合额外的信息，可以更准确地估计CATE，为决策提供更可靠的依据。

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental
challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized
medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning
has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible
effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many
covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a
phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the
outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In
medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways
frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically,
we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the
CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We
use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that
can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In
settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables
more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false
discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for
these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory.
We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free
discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley
values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at
the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes
marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the
validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our
machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several
effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction
effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文研究了在多敏感特征下贝叶斯最优公平分类器的特性，提出了适用于一般近似公平度量的理论框架，并通过实验验证了所提方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 本文为多敏感特征下的公平分类提供了理论框架和实用算法，扩展了贝叶斯最优公平分类器的适用范围，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers
a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined
by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the
Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general
approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We
show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions,
including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and
Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific
groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become
instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these
group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware
and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions
like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for
Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We
show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

TL;DR: 该研究首次综合分析了病理语音匿名化的感知效果，发现匿名化虽能有效保护隐私（准确率90%+），但会显著降低语音质量（从83%降至59%），且效果因语音障碍类型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索病理语音匿名化技术在保护隐私的同时对语音质量和诊断效用的影响，为未来匿名化策略提供人本化设计依据。

Method: 采用10名德语母语与非母语听者，通过零样本和少样本条件下的图灵测试与质量评分任务，评估180名不同病理类型（如构音障碍、嗓音障碍等）和健康对照者的匿名化-原始语音对。

Result: 匿名化识别准确率高（零样本91%，少样本93%），但质量评分显著下降（p<0.001），且不同病理类型下降程度不同（p=0.005）。母语与非母语听者评分差异在匿名化后几乎消失。

Conclusion: 需开发考虑听者感知、特定病理类型和语境的匿名化方法，在保护隐私的同时兼顾语音可理解性、沟通功能和诊断价值。

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of
pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain
understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered
analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual
protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse
linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated
anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and
Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.
Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error
rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination
and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot
(repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%
zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:
p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization
consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with
pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native
listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners
(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization
(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,
human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical
utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed,
disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy
while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic
utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

TL;DR: 本文提出D-Tracker方法，用于从高维社会活动数据流中捕捉时变时序模式并预测未来活动，具有可解释性、自动化和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会活动数据（如网络搜索量和传染病新感染数）反映了人们的兴趣和活动，但此类数据因高维和多重时变动态（如趋势、季节性和兴趣扩散）而难以建模和预测。

Method: D-Tracker将偏微分方程融入张量分解框架，以可解释方式捕捉时变模式（如趋势、季节性及地点间兴趣扩散），无需超参数且计算时间与时间序列长度无关。

Result: 在GoogleTrends搜索量数据和COVID-19感染数据上的实验表明，D-Tracker在更短计算时间内实现了更高的预测精度，并能提取地点间兴趣扩散。

Conclusion: D-Tracker是一种高效、自动且可解释的方法，适用于社会活动数据流的时序建模与预测。

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes
and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples'
interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from
such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and
forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are
high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends,
seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a
method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social
activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed
method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the
partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and
captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and
interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic:
it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully
automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent
of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained
from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data
Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less
computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion
between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces
major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task
planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in
response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task
requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper
proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV
swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs)
is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting
them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target
tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV
motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of
emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted
across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to
dynamic changes.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by
limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design
tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated
design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider
shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex
solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated
computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the
creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach
involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,
utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable
neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow
facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading
to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control
settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming
pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders
surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By
addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid
surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly
efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean
exploration and environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving. However, fully exploiting their capabilities for
safe and reliable vehicle control remains an open research challenge. To
systematically examine advances and limitations of VLMs in driving tasks, we
introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous

evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct
twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their
performance on the nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing metrics
such as inference time, computational cost, and predictive accuracy.
Illustrative examples highlight that, despite their strong scenario
interpretation capabilities, VLMs' practical performance in autonomous driving
tasks remains concerning, emphasizing the need for further improvements. The

Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis
framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the
framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient
considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a
hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of
ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives
vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic
ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety
measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the
framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order
Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted
high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent
maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against
traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on
highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for
active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception
in complex traffic environments.

Result: 在典型仓库场景中的测试表明，该方法在动态障碍物避障方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的集成方法实现了动态环境中移动机器人的高效安全导航，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control
of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists
of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions
of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these
predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an
energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step
predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized
to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of
treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by
proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The
overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a
specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach
allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its
performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical
warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across
diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can
account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules
or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured
environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to
dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework
consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an
adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and
improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed
approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world
hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on
flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes.
Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the
controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating
enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or
manual tuning.

Motivation: 现有交互式机器人学习方法通常局限于单任务场景，难以适应持续的多任务协作需求。为了降低人类在多任务协作中的工作量并提升适应性，需要一种新的交互规划方法。

Method: COIL框架通过优化选择技能、偏好和帮助三种查询类型来最小化人类工作量。已知用户偏好时，采用无容量设施选址（UFL）问题形式化；偏好不确定时，结合一步信念空间规划，并利用近似算法保持多项式时间性能。

Conclusion: COIL框架为多任务协作提供了一种高效且适应性强的交互规划方法，有效降低了人类工作量，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user
preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot
learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to
single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task
collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a
multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of
tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,
and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an
uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal
planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We
extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by
incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation
algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated
and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework
significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while
maintaining successful task completion.

Conclusion: FedEMA通过双目标优化有效解决了时序遗忘问题，为自动驾驶场景的联邦学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex
task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically
face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models
through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models
face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically
evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of
historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average
(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral
innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation
via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL
round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative
entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to
EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a
dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and
adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the
proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid
dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing
7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating
autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,
existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient
consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion
model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial
safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a
graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that
captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational
efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the
denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and
adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that
drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally
realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module
based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical
plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness
and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a
high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic
safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation
of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly
elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation
(DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited
degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial
observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling
complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a
novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called
INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with
partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit
surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform
exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that
enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while
efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative
analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation
studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm. Videos are available at

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)

Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We
identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K
specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in
five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D
space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped
navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL
satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach
is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we
show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and
robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,
verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research
domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon
this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our
application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively
transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution
monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding
drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose
a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network
controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show
that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition
benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying
such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose
a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate
formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results
suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and
robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited
in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle
and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,
which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will
enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's
lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ParkDiffusion是一种基于扩散模型的新方法，用于预测自动停车场景中车辆和行人的轨迹，通过双地图编码器、自适应代理类型嵌入模块和运动学框架，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在单模态车辆轨迹预测上，对于自动停车场景中车辆和行人轨迹的预测研究较少，需要一种能够处理不确定性和多模态的方法。

Method: 提出ParkDiffusion，采用扩散模型捕捉轨迹的不确定性和多模态，结合双地图编码器、自适应代理类型嵌入模块和运动学框架生成物理可行的轨迹。

Result: 在DLP和inD数据集上的实验表明，ParkDiffusion在异构轨迹预测中表现优异，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: ParkDiffusion为停车场景中的异构轨迹预测设立了新基准，展示了扩散模型在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.

TL;DR: 引入了一种基于手绘符号表示的新型机器人视觉指令（RoVI）范式，通过视觉语言模型（VLMs）解析并生成精确的3D动作序列，显著提升了机器人任务的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言在机器人控制中因缺乏空间精度而存在模糊性和冗长问题，因此需要一种更直观、精确的交互方式。

Method: 提出了RoVI视觉指令范式，结合VIEW流程，利用VLMs解析2D手绘符号（如箭头、圆圈等），提取关键点并生成3D动作序列。同时，通过15K样本数据集微调小规模VLMs以适应边缘部署。

Conclusion: RoVI和VIEW为机器人控制提供了一种高效且泛化性强的视觉指令方案，解决了自然语言的局限性，代码与数据集将开源。

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot
interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic
control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel
paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic
representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into
human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,
circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable
robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we
present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for
RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from
2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable
3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K
instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to
effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated
across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating
significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success
rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step
actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and
Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

### [204] [Evaluating the AI-Lab Intervention: Impact on Student Perception and Use of Generative AI in Early Undergraduate Computer Science Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00100)
*Ethan Dickey,Andres Bejarano,Rhianna Kuperus,Bárbara Fagundes*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在计算机科学教育中引入结构化‘AI-Lab’干预对本科生学习、技能发展和认知的影响，发现这种干预能帮助学生更有效地使用生成式AI工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在教育中的应用效果，填补关于如何通过结构化引导工具使用的研究空白。

Method: 在三个学期中，将AI-Lab模块整合到四门课程中，收集831份匹配的干预前后调查问卷，并进行焦点小组讨论，采用混合方法分析数据和学生体验。

Result: 干预后，学生在概念、调试和作业问题上的舒适度和开放性显著提高，调试使用模式也有显著变化，表明学生更谨慎和深思熟虑地使用AI工具。

Conclusion: 结构化干预能帮助学生有效利用生成式AI而不损害核心能力，为教育者提供了基于证据的建议，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its
effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain
underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on
structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines
the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided
scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data
Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering
courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and
elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey
responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods
approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as
well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming
projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and
openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage
patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting
students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions
corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap"
between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools
into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill
development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable
students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential
competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to
integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for
future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.

Conclusion: 论文总结了当前方法的优缺点，并建议未来开发更具可解释性、稳健性和通用性的LLMs心理评估框架。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered
tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their
social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews
have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not
been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse
psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications
of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically
review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1)
assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics
(consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation
methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both
the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit
reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant
variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological
challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs'
capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study
aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust,
and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more
domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and
hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence,
individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that
engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size,
membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we
introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two
or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven
systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected
interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with
language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives
each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how
differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a
collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between
collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be
able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for
themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts
simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We
find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor
fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that
heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results
signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models
and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these
systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system
developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use
their own data to promote their own interests.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高斯过程回归和图核的机器学习模型（WWL-GPR），用于预测过渡态能量，显著提升了反向水煤气变换反应在单原子合金催化剂上的能量预测精度，并通过不确定性传播优化了催化活性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的第一性原理方法（如DFT）计算过渡态能量成本高，限制了复杂材料与反应网络的高效筛选；为此，作者希望通过机器学习模型降低计算成本并提高精度。

Method: 采用高斯过程回归（GPR）结合Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman图核（WWL），构建机器学习模型预测过渡态能量，并通过训练数据子采样生成模型集合以量化不确定性。

Result: WWL-GPR模型相比传统标度关系或非图表示的ML模型，误差降低近一个数量级；并通过微动力学模型验证其对催化活性预测的显著改进。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了机器学习与DFT结合在复杂反应（如RWGS）催化剂设计中的潜力，为未来催化剂筛选提供了高效且可靠的框架。

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in
computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the
high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density
functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for
predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the
Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to
predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)
reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can
significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on
scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further
benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of
WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data
and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF)
predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models.
Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that
the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to
scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy
predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to
screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work
highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and
microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS,
providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

Motivation: 在高保真动力系统解需重复评估且无法访问控制方程的情况下，数据驱动降阶技术更适用。本研究旨在通过主动学习减少计算成本并提升模型效率。

Method: 提出子空间距离驱动的主动学习（SDE-AL）框架，结合POD表达解的子空间，基于子空间相似性度量动态选择参数样本，并扩展至两种现有非侵入式ROM方法。

Result: 在两种参数化物理模型上验证了SDE-AL的高效性，实现了主动学习驱动的ROM构建（SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN/NN）。

Conclusion: SDE-AL框架通过子空间距离度量优化样本选择，显著提升了ROM的构建效率和准确性，适用于数据驱动的参数化模型降阶。

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to
be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in
absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model
reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning
approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by
greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter
domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of
high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The
high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific
linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and
the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to
perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance
measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with
different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The
usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)
framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive
reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven
(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.
Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,
highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily
affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed
globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan
Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is
crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition,
existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities
and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these
gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems
across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test
data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on
over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key
aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and
system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing
actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition
systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine
learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD
diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task
concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource
scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The
scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and
value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation
under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous
multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel
sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design
improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the
experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling
scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches
across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success
rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the
proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in
multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource
allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load,
demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice
systems.
