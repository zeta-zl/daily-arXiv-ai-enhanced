### [1] [How Social is It? A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04628)
*Yusen Wu,Junwu Xiong,Xiaotie Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为HSII的基准测试，用于系统评估大语言模型在复杂社交任务中的能力，并引入新指标COT-complexity来衡量效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能系统评估大语言模型在复杂社交环境中的多用户、多轮交互能力，需填补这一空白。

Method: 基于社会学原理设计HSII基准，分四个阶段评估模型社交能力，并通过聚类分析和COT方法优化性能。

Result: 实验表明HSII能有效评估模型的社交技能，且COT-complexity指标可在准确性与效率间实现更好平衡。

Conclusion: HSII为评估LLM的社交能力提供了标准化工具，未来可推动LLM在复杂社交场景中的应用。

Abstract: Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,
instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with
only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently
play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social
settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically
measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an
agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.
Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII
below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social
agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:
format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable
conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion
capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,
HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform
an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we
investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'
social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new
statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs
with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between
measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments
demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in
LLMs.

### [2] [Adaptive Token Boundaries: Integrating Human Chunking Mechanisms into Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04637)
*Dongxing Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过比较人类跨模态信息处理与多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的差异，提出一种动态跨模态分词框架，显著提升了模型性能并使其更接近人类认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在处理多样数据上表现优异，其与人类认知的动态性和上下文敏感性仍存在差距。

Method: 研究通过比较人类与模型在视觉-语言任务中的表现，提出基于认知科学原理的动态跨模态分词框架，包含自适应边界、分层表示和对齐机制。

Result: 该框架在视觉问答和复杂场景描述任务中分别取得7.8%和5.3%的性能提升，且表现出更接近人类的错误模式和注意力分布。

Conclusion: 研究不仅加深了对人类认知与AI关系的理解，也为开发更具认知合理性的AI系统提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing diverse data types, yet
significant disparities persist between human cognitive processes and
computational approaches to multimodal information integration. This research
presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human
cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in
MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with
model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that
conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current
models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human
information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal
tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical
representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science
principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on
benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene
Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention
distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of
the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while
providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI
systems.

### [3] [Language translation, and change of accent for speech-to-speech task using diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04639)
*Abhishek Mishra,Ritesh Sur Chowdhury,Vartul Bahuguna,Isha Pandey,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一方法，同时处理语音翻译和口音适应，利用扩散模型生成目标语音，实现更高效和有效的跨文化交流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音到语音翻译（S2ST）通常只关注语言翻译或口音适应之一，但跨文化沟通需要同时处理两者。

Method: 将任务重新定义为条件生成问题，利用扩散模型基于音素和目标语音特征生成Mel频谱图，联合优化翻译和口音适应。

Result: 提出的方法比传统流程更高效且参数更少，能够同时完成翻译和口音适应。

Conclusion: 该方法为同时处理语音翻译和口音适应提供了统一的解决方案，并在效率和效果上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) aims to convert spoken input in one
language to spoken output in another, typically focusing on either language
translation or accent adaptation. However, effective cross-cultural
communication requires handling both aspects simultaneously - translating
content while adapting the speaker's accent to match the target language
context. In this work, we propose a unified approach for simultaneous speech
translation and change of accent, a task that remains underexplored in current
literature. Our method reformulates the problem as a conditional generation
task, where target speech is generated based on phonemes and guided by target
speech features. Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for
high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion
strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel
spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and
accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of
translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and
effective model compared to traditional pipelines.

Motivation: 评估Typica.ai定制模型在摩洛哥方言毒性检测中的表现，对比主流LLM模型，解决通用系统在文化相关毒性内容上的不足。

Method: 使用OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix数据集，通过精确度、召回率、F1分数和准确率评估Typica.ai与OpenAI、Mistral、Anthropic Claude模型的性能。

Result: Typica.ai在检测文化相关毒性内容（如隐含侮辱、讽刺等）上表现最优。

Conclusion: 文化适应模型对可靠内容审核至关重要，Typica.ai在方言毒性检测中具有显著优势。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative benchmark evaluating the performance of
Typica.ai's custom Moroccan Darija toxicity detection model against major
LLM-based moderation APIs: OpenAI (omni-moderation-latest), Mistral
(mistral-moderation-latest), and Anthropic Claude (claude-3-haiku-20240307). We
focus on culturally grounded toxic content, including implicit insults,
sarcasm, and culturally specific aggression often overlooked by general-purpose
systems. Using a balanced test set derived from the OMCD_Typica.ai_Mix dataset,
we report precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, offering insights into
challenges and opportunities for moderation in underrepresented languages. Our
results highlight Typica.ai's superior performance, underlining the importance
of culturally adapted models for reliable content moderation.

### [5] [Rethinking Multimodal Sentiment Analysis: A High-Accuracy, Simplified Fusion Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04642)
*Nischal Mandal,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的多模态情感分析模型，通过简单的特征融合方法在六类情感分类任务中达到92%的准确率，证明了简洁方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析通常依赖复杂的注意力机制，但本文旨在开发一种轻量且高效的模型，适用于资源受限的场景。

Method: 使用IEMOCAP数据集，设计模态特定的编码器（全连接层+Dropout），通过简单拼接和多层融合捕获跨模态交互。

Result: 模型在六类情感分类中达到92%准确率，性能与复杂模型相当但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的特征工程和模块化结构，简单融合策略在资源受限环境下可超越或匹配复杂模型。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis, a pivotal task in affective computing, seeks
to understand human emotions by integrating cues from language, audio, and
visual signals. While many recent approaches leverage complex attention
mechanisms and hierarchical architectures, we propose a lightweight, yet
effective fusion-based deep learning model tailored for utterance-level emotion
classification. Using the benchmark IEMOCAP dataset, which includes aligned
text, audio-derived numeric features, and visual descriptors, we design a
modality-specific encoder using fully connected layers followed by dropout
regularization. The modality-specific representations are then fused using
simple concatenation and passed through a dense fusion layer to capture
cross-modal interactions. This streamlined architecture avoids computational
overhead while preserving performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
92% across six emotion categories. Our approach demonstrates that with careful
feature engineering and modular design, simpler fusion strategies can
outperform or match more complex models, particularly in resource-constrained
environments.

### [6] [Prediction-powered estimators for finite population statistics in highly imbalanced textual data: Public hate crime estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04643)
*Hannes Waldetoft,Jakob Torgander,Måns Magnusson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用Transformer编码器神经网络的预测结果与调查抽样估计器结合，提出了一种高效估计文本数据集中人口参数的方法，应用于瑞典仇恨犯罪统计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动标注目标变量标签时估算文本数据集中人口参数的挑战。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器神经网络预测和调查抽样估计器（如Hansen-Hurwitz估计器、差异估计和分层随机抽样估计）。

Result: 在瑞典仇恨犯罪统计中验证了方法的适用性，提供了高效的估计并减少了手动标注时间。

Conclusion: 若有标注训练数据，所提方法可提供非常高效的估计，减少手动标注时间。

Abstract: Estimating population parameters in finite populations of text documents can
be challenging when obtaining the labels for the target variable requires
manual annotation. To address this problem, we combine predictions from a
transformer encoder neural network with well-established survey sampling
estimators using the model predictions as an auxiliary variable. The
applicability is demonstrated in Swedish hate crime statistics based on Swedish
police reports. Estimates of the yearly number of hate crimes and the police's
under-reporting are derived using the Hansen-Hurwitz estimator, difference
estimation, and stratified random sampling estimation. We conclude that if
labeled training data is available, the proposed method can provide very
efficient estimates with reduced time spent on manual annotation.

### [7] [ChatGPT for automated grading of short answer questions in mechanical ventilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04645)
*Tejas Jade,Alex Yartsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文评估了ChatGPT 4o在研究生医学课程中自动评分短答案问题的效果，发现其评分与人类评分存在显著差异，系统性偏低且一致性差，建议在重要评估中谨慎使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）能够模拟对话并解释自由文本回答，适合用于自动评分短答案问题（SAQs），但在实际应用中的准确性尚需验证。

Method: 研究使用ChatGPT 4o对215名学生的557份短答案回答进行评分，评分标准由标准化提示和评分细则提供，并通过混合效应模型、方差分析、ICCs等统计方法分析结果。

Result: ChatGPT评分系统性低于人类评分（平均差异-1.34，10分制），个体一致性差（ICC1=0.086），且60%以上的评分超出高风险评估可接受范围。

Conclusion: 研究提醒在研究生课程作业评分中谨慎使用LLMs，尤其是涉及评估性和分析性项目时。

Abstract: Standardised tests using short answer questions (SAQs) are common in
postgraduate education. Large language models (LLMs) simulate conversational
language and interpret unstructured free-text responses in ways aligning with
applying SAQ grading rubrics, making them attractive for automated grading. We
evaluated ChatGPT 4o to grade SAQs in a postgraduate medical setting using data
from 215 students (557 short-answer responses) enrolled in an online course on
mechanical ventilation (2020--2024). Deidentified responses to three case-based
scenarios were presented to ChatGPT with a standardised grading prompt and
rubric. Outputs were analysed using mixed-effects modelling, variance component
analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), Cohen's kappa, Kendall's
W, and Bland--Altman statistics. ChatGPT awarded systematically lower marks
than human graders with a mean difference (bias) of -1.34 on a 10-point scale.
ICC values indicated poor individual-level agreement (ICC1 = 0.086), and
Cohen's kappa (-0.0786) suggested no meaningful agreement. Variance component
analysis showed minimal variability among the five ChatGPT sessions (G-value =
0.87), indicating internal consistency but divergence from the human grader.
The poorest agreement was observed for evaluative and analytic items, whereas
checklist and prescriptive rubric items had less disagreement. We caution
against the use of LLMs in grading postgraduate coursework. Over 60% of
ChatGPT-assigned grades differed from human grades by more than acceptable
boundaries for high-stakes assessments.

Conclusion: FRAME为自动化医学论文生成提供了高效且严谨的解决方案，同时保障学术标准。

Abstract: The automation of scientific research through large language models (LLMs)
presents significant opportunities but faces critical challenges in knowledge
synthesis and quality assurance. We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent
Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation
through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises
three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that
decomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through
iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator,
Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality
through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework
that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental
results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements
over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with
DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation
dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve
quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in
synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work
could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for
automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic
standards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming scientific hypothesis
generation and validation by enabling information synthesis, latent
relationship discovery, and reasoning augmentation. This survey provides a
structured overview of LLM-driven approaches, including symbolic frameworks,
generative models, hybrid systems, and multi-agent architectures. We examine
techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge-graph completion,
simulation, causal inference, and tool-assisted reasoning, highlighting
trade-offs in interpretability, novelty, and domain alignment. We contrast
early symbolic discovery systems (e.g., BACON, KEKADA) with modern LLM
pipelines that leverage in-context learning and domain adaptation via
fine-tuning, retrieval, and symbolic grounding. For validation, we review
simulation, human-AI collaboration, causal modeling, and uncertainty
quantification, emphasizing iterative assessment in open-world contexts. The
survey maps datasets across biomedicine, materials science, environmental
science, and social science, introducing new resources like AHTech and
CSKG-600. Finally, we outline a roadmap emphasizing novelty-aware generation,
multimodal-symbolic integration, human-in-the-loop systems, and ethical
safeguards, positioning LLMs as agents for principled, scalable scientific
discovery.

TL;DR: 该研究通过增强大型语言模型（LLM）在医疗诊断对话中的多模态数据处理能力，开发了AMIE系统，并在实验中证明其在多模态和非多模态指标上优于初级保健医师。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在远程医疗诊断中缺乏对多模态数据的处理能力，无法满足真实医疗咨询的需求。

Method: 研究利用Gemini 2.0 Flash实现状态感知对话框架，动态控制对话流程，并通过中间模型输出指导后续问题，模拟资深医师的问诊过程。

Result: 在模拟实验中，AMIE在多模态（7/9）和非多模态（29/32）指标上表现优于初级保健医师，尤其在诊断准确性方面。

Conclusion: 研究表明多模态对话诊断AI取得显著进展，但实际应用仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for conducting
diagnostic conversations but evaluation has been largely limited to
language-only interactions, deviating from the real-world requirements of
remote care delivery. Instant messaging platforms permit clinicians and
patients to upload and discuss multimodal medical artifacts seamlessly in
medical consultation, but the ability of LLMs to reason over such data while
preserving other attributes of competent diagnostic conversation remains
unknown. Here we advance the conversational diagnosis and management
performance of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a
new capability to gather and interpret multimodal data, and reason about this
precisely during consultations. Leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash, our system
implements a state-aware dialogue framework, where conversation flow is
dynamically controlled by intermediate model outputs reflecting patient states
and evolving diagnoses. Follow-up questions are strategically directed by
uncertainty in such patient states, leading to a more structured multimodal
history-taking process that emulates experienced clinicians. We compared AMIE
to primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, blinded, OSCE-style study of
chat-based consultations with patient actors. We constructed 105 evaluation
scenarios using artifacts like smartphone skin photos, ECGs, and PDFs of
clinical documents across diverse conditions and demographics. Our rubric
assessed multimodal capabilities and other clinically meaningful axes like
history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication, and
empathy. Specialist evaluation showed AMIE to be superior to PCPs on 7/9
multimodal and 29/32 non-multimodal axes (including diagnostic accuracy). The
results show clear progress in multimodal conversational diagnostic AI, but
real-world translation needs further research.

Motivation: 随着AI和LLMs的快速发展，其伦理问题（如安全性、滥用、歧视）日益突出，需要系统评估和衡量这些技术的潜在危害。

Method: 采用比较分析法，评测包括DeepSeek-V3、GPT变体及Gemini在内的多款模型，并引入新指标RDC量化其危害性。

Result: 不同AI模型的伦理表现存在显著差异，新指标RDC能有效衡量其潜在危害，高风险场景需人工介入。

Conclusion: AI伦理评估需标准化，RDC为量化危害提供工具，同时强调人工监督在关键决策中的必要性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly
evolved in recent years, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding and generation. However, these advancements also raise critical
ethical questions regarding safety, potential misuse, discrimination and
overall societal impact. This article provides a comparative analysis of the
ethical performance of various AI models, including the brand new
DeepSeek-V3(R1 with reasoning and without), various GPT variants (4o, 3.5
Turbo, 4 Turbo, o1/o3 mini) and Gemini (1.5 flash, 2.0 flash and 2.0 flash exp)
and highlights the need for robust human oversight, especially in situations
with high stakes. Furthermore, we present a new metric for calculating harm in
LLMs called Relative Danger Coefficient (RDC).

### [12] [Integration of Large Language Models and Traditional Deep Learning for Social Determinants of Health Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04655)
*Paul Landes,Jimeng Sun,Adam Cross*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何从临床文本中自动提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），比较了传统深度学习和大型语言模型（LLM）的优劣，并提出了一种结合两者优势的高效方法，显著提升了分类速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对健康结果有重要影响，但传统方法提取效率低。论文旨在通过自动提取SDoH，帮助医生更高效地进行诊断和决策。

Method: 论文结合传统深度学习和LLM，提出了一种高效分类方法，避免了昂贵的LLM处理，显著提升了速度（12倍），同时在公开数据集上进行了多标签SDoH分类测试。

Result: 模型在SDoH多标签分类上比之前提升了10个点，并通过合成数据补充和传统深度学习模型实现了高性能，部分表现甚至优于LLM。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法结合了LLM的精度和传统深度学习的高效性，为SDoH的自动预测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) are economic, social and personal
circumstances that affect or influence an individual's health status. SDoHs
have shown to be correlated to wellness outcomes, and therefore, are useful to
physicians in diagnosing diseases and in decision-making. In this work, we
automatically extract SDoHs from clinical text using traditional deep learning
and Large Language Models (LLMs) to find the advantages and disadvantages of
each on an existing publicly available dataset. Our models outperform a
previous reference point on a multilabel SDoH classification by 10 points, and
we present a method and model to drastically speed up classification (12X
execution time) by eliminating expensive LLM processing. The method we present
combines a more nimble and efficient solution that leverages the power of the
LLM for precision and traditional deep learning methods for efficiency. We also
show highly performant results on a dataset supplemented with synthetic data
and several traditional deep learning models that outperform LLMs. Our models
and methods offer the next iteration of automatic prediction of SDoHs that
impact at-risk patients.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成合成跌倒数据以解决真实数据稀缺的问题，评估了文本到动作（T2M）和文本到文本模型的性能，发现数据特征和传感器配置对合成数据的有效性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实跌倒数据（尤其是老年人）稀缺，研究者希望通过LLMs生成合成数据来改进跌倒检测系统的训练。

Method: 使用文本到动作（T2M, SATO, ParCo）和文本到文本模型（GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini）生成合成数据，并与真实数据集结合，通过LSTM模型评估其对跌倒检测性能的影响。

Result: 合成数据的有效性受数据集特征影响，LLM生成数据在低频（如20Hz）表现最佳，但在高频（如200Hz）不稳定。扩散方法生成的合成数据与真实数据分布最接近，但未显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 合成数据的优化需考虑传感器配置和跌倒表现特征，为未来跌倒检测模型的合成数据生成提供了参考。

Abstract: Training fall detection systems is challenging due to the scarcity of
real-world fall data, particularly from elderly individuals. To address this,
we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
synthetic fall data. This study evaluates text-to-motion (T2M, SATO, ParCo) and
text-to-text models (GPT4o, GPT4, Gemini) in simulating realistic fall
scenarios. We generate synthetic datasets and integrate them with four
real-world baseline datasets to assess their impact on fall detection
performance using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Additionally, we
compare LLM-generated synthetic data with a diffusion-based method to evaluate
their alignment with real accelerometer distributions. Results indicate that
dataset characteristics significantly influence the effectiveness of synthetic
data, with LLM-generated data performing best in low-frequency settings (e.g.,
20Hz) while showing instability in high-frequency datasets (e.g., 200Hz). While
text-to-motion models produce more realistic biomechanical data than
text-to-text models, their impact on fall detection varies. Diffusion-based
synthetic data demonstrates the closest alignment to real data but does not
consistently enhance model performance. An ablation study further confirms that
the effectiveness of synthetic data depends on sensor placement and fall
representation. These findings provide insights into optimizing synthetic data
generation for fall detection models.

Abstract: Although large language models have demonstrated the potential for
personalized advertising recommendations in experimental environments, in
actual operations, how advertising recommendation systems can be combined with
measures such as user privacy protection and data security is still an area
worthy of in-depth discussion. To this end, this paper studies the personalized
risks and regulatory strategies of large language models in digital
advertising. This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model
(LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer
architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural
language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an
algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor
risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing,
feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT
for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user
portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure
the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper
designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a
large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The
experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively
improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the
same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the
risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.

*Mohammad Aqib,Mohd Hamza,Qipei Mei,Ying Hei Chui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何通过检索增强生成（RAG）系统解决建筑规范文本查询的复杂性，重点比较了不同检索方法并优化了语言模型的微调。实验表明，Elasticsearch是最佳检索工具，且基于NBCC数据的微调能显著提升生成内容的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑规范文本复杂且更新频繁，手动查询效率低。开发基于RAG的问答系统可解决文本量大、术语难理解以及跨章节关联性差等问题。

Method: 研究评估了多种检索方法在《加拿大国家建筑规范》（NBCC）上的表现，并对语言模型进行领域微调，结合检索器（如Elasticsearch）优化RAG系统。

Result: Elasticsearch被证明是最鲁棒的检索工具；基于NBCC数据的微调提升了语言模型的上下文生成能力。二者结合显著优化了RAG系统的性能。

Conclusion: RAG系统结合高效检索和微调后的语言模型，能有效应对建筑规范的复杂性，为自动化查询提供可行方案。

Abstract: Building codes are regulations that establish standards for the design,
construction, and safety of buildings to ensure structural integrity, fire
protection, and accessibility. They are often extensive, complex, and subject
to frequent updates, making manual querying challenging and time-consuming. Key
difficulties include navigating large volumes of text, interpreting technical
language, and identifying relevant clauses across different sections. A
potential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers
user queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a
QA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG
consists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study
focuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and
optimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning
techniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by
performing the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and
explored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models
using the dataset derived from NBCC. Our analysis included a comparative
assessment of different retrievers and the performance of both pre-trained and
fine-tuned models to determine the efficacy and domain-specific adaptation of
language models using fine-tuning on the NBCC dataset. Experimental results
showed that Elasticsearch proved to be the most robust retriever among all. The
findings also indicate that fine-tuning language models on an NBCC-specific
dataset can enhance their ability to generate contextually relevant responses.
When combined with context retrieved by a powerful retriever like
Elasticsearch, this improvement in LLM performance can optimize the RAG system,
enabling it to better navigate the complexities of the NBCC.

TL;DR: Reward-SQL框架通过引入过程奖励模型（PRMs）优化Text-to-SQL任务，采用“冷启动后PRM监督”策略，结合链式CTEs分解SQL查询，并通过GRPO和PRM引导推理实现性能提升，在BIRD基准测试中准确率提高13.1%，Qwen2.5-Coder-7B模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在Text-to-SQL任务中的准确性，通过引入PRMs细化监督，避免推理轨迹偏差。

Method: 采用“冷启动后PRM监督”策略：1) 用链式CTEs分解SQL为结构化推理链；2) 研究四种PRM整合策略，发现GRPO结合PRM引导推理（如best-of-N采样）效果最佳。

Result: 在BIRD测试中，7B PRM监督的模型性能提升13.1%；GRPO对齐的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B模型开发集准确率达68.9%，超越同类基线。

Conclusion: Reward-SQL有效利用奖励监督优化Text-to-SQL推理，通过结构化分解和PRM策略实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
performance on the Text-to-SQL task by leveraging their powerful reasoning
capabilities. To enhance accuracy during the reasoning process, external
Process Reward Models (PRMs) can be introduced during training and inference to
provide fine-grained supervision. However, if misused, PRMs may distort the
reasoning trajectory and lead to suboptimal or incorrect SQL generation.To
address this challenge, we propose Reward-SQL, a framework that systematically
explores how to incorporate PRMs into the Text-to-SQL reasoning process
effectively. Our approach follows a "cold start, then PRM supervision"
paradigm. Specifically, we first train the model to decompose SQL queries into
structured stepwise reasoning chains using common table expressions
(Chain-of-CTEs), establishing a strong and interpretable reasoning baseline.
Then, we investigate four strategies for integrating PRMs, and find that
combining PRM as an online training signal (GRPO) with PRM-guided inference
(e.g., best-of-N sampling) yields the best results. Empirically, on the BIRD
benchmark, Reward-SQL enables models supervised by a 7B PRM to achieve a 13.1%
performance gain across various guidance strategies. Notably, our GRPO-aligned
policy model based on Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct achieves 68.9% accuracy on the
BIRD development set, outperforming all baseline methods under the same model
size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Reward-SQL in leveraging
reward-based supervision for Text-to-SQL reasoning. Our code is publicly
available.

*Madhur Jindal,Saurabh Deshpande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了REVEAL框架，用于评估视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在多轮对话中的安全性，发现多轮交互下模型的缺陷率显著增加，GPT-4o表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅针对单轮文本交互的安全性评估框架无法应对VLLMs在多模态和多轮对话中的新安全与伦理挑战，因此需要开发更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出REVEAL框架，包括自动图像挖掘、合成对抗数据生成、多轮对话扩展（使用crescendo攻击策略）以及基于GPT-4o等评估器的全面危害评估。

Result: 在多轮交互中，VLLMs的缺陷率显著高于单轮评估，GPT-4o在安全性和可用性方面表现最佳，而Llama-3.2和Qwen2-VL分别暴露了最高缺陷率和拒绝率。

Conclusion: REVEAL框架成功揭示了VLLMs在多轮对话中的深层漏洞，尤其是错误信息领域的防御需加强，为未来模型安全性改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) represent a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence by integrating image-processing capabilities with
textual understanding, thereby enhancing user interactions and expanding
application domains. However, their increased complexity introduces novel
safety and ethical challenges, particularly in multi-modal and multi-turn
conversations. Traditional safety evaluation frameworks, designed for
text-based, single-turn interactions, are inadequate for addressing these
complexities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the REVEAL (Responsible
Evaluation of Vision-Enabled AI LLMs) Framework, a scalable and automated
pipeline for evaluating image-input harms in VLLMs. REVEAL includes automated
image mining, synthetic adversarial data generation, multi-turn conversational
expansion using crescendo attack strategies, and comprehensive harm assessment
through evaluators like GPT-4o.
  We extensively evaluated five state-of-the-art VLLMs, GPT-4o, Llama-3.2,
Qwen2-VL, Phi3.5V, and Pixtral, across three important harm categories: sexual
harm, violence, and misinformation. Our findings reveal that multi-turn
interactions result in significantly higher defect rates compared to
single-turn evaluations, highlighting deeper vulnerabilities in VLLMs. Notably,
GPT-4o demonstrated the most balanced performance as measured by our
Safety-Usability Index (SUI) followed closely by Pixtral. Additionally,
misinformation emerged as a critical area requiring enhanced contextual
defenses. Llama-3.2 exhibited the highest MT defect rate ($16.55 \%$) while
Qwen2-VL showed the highest MT refusal rate ($19.1 \%$).

Conclusion: 深度学习在古文字解读中展现出潜力，未来将通过集成方法优化性能，结合计算语言学与考古学推动历史研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a thoroughly automated method for identifying and
interpreting cuneiform characters via advanced deep-learning algorithms. Five
distinct deep-learning models were trained on a comprehensive dataset of
cuneiform characters and evaluated according to critical performance metrics,
including accuracy and precision. Two models demonstrated outstanding
performance and were subsequently assessed using cuneiform symbols from the
Hammurabi law acquisition, notably Hammurabi Law 1. Each model effectively
recognized the relevant Akkadian meanings of the symbols and delivered precise
English translations. Future work will investigate ensemble and stacking
approaches to optimize performance, utilizing hybrid architectures to improve
detection accuracy and reliability. This research explores the linguistic
relationships between Akkadian, an ancient Mesopotamian language, and Arabic,
emphasizing their historical and cultural linkages. This study demonstrates the
capability of deep learning to decipher ancient scripts by merging
computational linguistics with archaeology, therefore providing significant
insights for the comprehension and conservation of human history.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了针对中国国有企业（SOAEs）的领域特定大语言模型SOAEsV2-7B/72B，通过三阶段框架解决现有方法的局限性：1)持续预训练整合领域知识；2)渐进式领域微调优化任务能力；3)蒸馏增强推测解码加速推理，实验表明在保持通用能力的同时显著提升领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前针对中国国有企业的领域特定大语言模型存在模型容量受限、过度依赖领域数据、推理效率低的问题，本研究旨在通过综合方法解决这些挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1)持续预训练；2)渐进式领域微调；3)蒸馏增强推测解码，结合7B和72B模型提升效能。

Result: 模型在保持99.8%通用能力的同时，Rouge-1和BLEU-4得分分别提升1.08倍和1.17倍；渐进式微调比单阶段训练性能更优。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个全流程优化方案，成功在通用语言能力和领域专业知识间取得平衡。

Abstract: This study addresses key challenges in developing domain-specific large
language models (LLMs) for Chinese state-owned assets and enterprises (SOAEs),
where current approaches face three limitations: 1) constrained model capacity
that limits knowledge integration and cross-task adaptability; 2) excessive
reliance on domain-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, which neglects
the broader applicability of general language patterns; and 3) inefficient
inference acceleration for large models processing long contexts. In this work,
we propose SOAEsV2-7B/72B, a specialized LLM series developed via a three-phase
framework: 1) continual pre-training integrates domain knowledge while
retaining base capabilities; 2) domain-progressive SFT employs curriculum-based
learning strategy, transitioning from weakly relevant conversational data to
expert-annotated SOAEs datasets to optimize domain-specific tasks; 3)
distillation-enhanced speculative decoding accelerates inference via logit
distillation between 72B target and 7B draft models, achieving
1.39-1.52$\times$ speedup without quality loss. Experimental results
demonstrate that our domain-specific pre-training phase maintains 99.8% of
original general language capabilities while significantly improving domain
performance, resulting in a 1.08$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 score and a
1.17$\times$ enhancement in BLEU-4 score. Ablation studies further show that
domain-progressive SFT outperforms single-stage training, achieving
1.02$\times$ improvement in Rouge-1 and 1.06$\times$ in BLEU-4. Our work
introduces a comprehensive, full-pipeline approach for optimizing SOAEs LLMs,
bridging the gap between general language capabilities and domain-specific
expertise.

Motivation: 先前的研究将文学情感与视觉文化领域独立考察，而两者间系统性关联的研究不足，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用BERT模型分析唐宋诗词中的牡丹和梅花意象，量化情感变化，并将其与纺织品、陶瓷等物质文化中的视觉证据进行交叉验证。

Result: 研究发现唐宋时期花卉意象的情感内涵存在可测量的变化，并揭示了文学表达与艺术表现之间未被认识到的协同关系。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了计算人文方法与传统汉学方法的结合，能够有效揭示文学与视觉文化之间的深层联系。

Abstract: The Tang (618 to 907) and Song (960 to 1279) dynasties witnessed an
extraordinary flourishing of Chinese cultural expression, where floral motifs
served as a dynamic medium for both poetic sentiment and artistic design. While
previous scholarship has examined these domains independently, the systematic
correlation between evolving literary emotions and visual culture remains
underexplored. This study addresses that gap by employing BERT-based sentiment
analysis to quantify emotional patterns in floral imagery across Tang Song
poetry, then validating these patterns against contemporaneous developments in
decorative arts.Our approach builds upon recent advances in computational
humanities while remaining grounded in traditional sinological methods. By
applying a fine tuned BERT model to analyze peony and plum blossom imagery in
classical poetry, we detect measurable shifts in emotional connotations between
the Tang and Song periods. These textual patterns are then cross berenced with
visual evidence from textiles, ceramics, and other material culture, revealing
previously unrecognized synergies between literary expression and artistic
representation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于扰动多跳问答数据集的幻觉检测方法，通过监督微调，用7B参数的模型在RAGTruth基准上实现了比GPT-4o更高的召回率，同时保持了较高的精度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的检索增强生成（RAG）系统虽然能提高语言模型的事实性，但幻觉现象仍阻碍其部署。现有检测方法依赖人工或闭源模型，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 论文构建了一个带诱导幻觉的扰动多跳问答数据集，并通过监督微调训练了一个7B参数的模型。

Result: 该模型在RAGTruth基准测试中召回率优于GPT-4o，同时精度和准确性具有竞争力，且参数规模更小。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、低成本的幻觉检测方案，为RAG系统的实际部署提供了可能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have gained widespread adoption
by application builders because they leverage sources of truth to enable Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate more factually sound responses. However,
hallucinations, instances of LLM responses that are unfaithful to the provided
context, often prevent these systems from being deployed in production
environments. Current hallucination detection methods typically involve human
evaluation or the use of closed-source models to review RAG system outputs for
hallucinations. Both human evaluators and closed-source models suffer from
scaling issues due to their high costs and slow inference speeds. In this work,
we introduce a perturbed multi-hop QA dataset with induced hallucinations. Via
supervised fine-tuning on our dataset, we achieve better recall with a 7B model
than GPT-4o on the RAGTruth hallucination detection benchmark and offer
competitive performance on precision and accuracy, all while using a fraction
of the parameters. Code is released at our repository.

Motivation: 尽管RAG（检索增强生成）通过上下文支撑减少幻觉，LLM仍频繁生成无依据信息或矛盾内容。论文旨在更精确地测量和减少LLM在总结任务中的幻觉现象。

Method: 分析了现有方法（如HHEM和Vectara排行榜）的局限性，提出FaithJudge——基于Few-shot人工标注的LLM-as-a-judge方案，用于更精准的幻觉评估。

Result: FaithJudge显著优于现有方法，改进的幻觉排行榜为RAG中LLM的可靠性提供了更稳健的基准。

Conclusion: 论文证明了FaithJudge在自动化幻觉评估中的有效性，同时通过新的排行榜推动了LLM可靠性研究的进展。

Abstract: Hallucinations remain a persistent challenge for LLMs. RAG aims to reduce
hallucinations by grounding responses in contexts. However, even when provided
context, LLMs still frequently introduce unsupported information or
contradictions. This paper presents our efforts to measure LLM hallucinations
with a focus on summarization tasks, assessing how often various LLMs introduce
hallucinations when summarizing documents. We discuss Vectara's existing LLM
hallucination leaderboard, based on the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model
(HHEM). While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great
research interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current
hallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods
on existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose
FaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination
annotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination
evaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination
leaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination
leaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in
RAG.

Motivation: 当前AI教育工具的语义检索系统难以适应学术内容的独特语言和结构特点，需要更高效的嵌入模型来支持教育问答。

Method: 构建了包含3,197个句对的人工与LLM辅助生成合成数据集，评估了两种训练策略：基线MNRL模型和结合MNRL与余弦相似性损失的双损失模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI have catalyzed the adoption of intelligent educational
tools, yet many semantic retrieval systems remain ill-suited to the unique
linguistic and structural characteristics of academic content. This study
presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question
answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset
of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased
questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a
combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted
generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model
fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model
that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking
and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course
syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into
course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that
both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model
narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as
OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series. This work contributes reusable,
domain-aligned embedding models and provides a replicable framework for
educational semantic retrieval, supporting downstream applications such as
academic chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, and learning
management system (LMS) integrations.

TL;DR: 研究发现，链式思维（CoT）中的关键令牌（存储中间结果）对大型语言模型（LLMs）解决复杂任务至关重要，但其内部机制仍不明确。实验发现，仅保留这些关键令牌也能达到类似效果，且中间结果的存储形式不影响性能。此外，随机干预CoT中的值会影响后续令牌和最终答案，表明CoT令牌可能像程序变量，但存在潜在缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨链式思维（CoT）在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的具体作用机制，尤其是其令牌如何影响模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: 通过两个组合任务（多位数乘法和动态规划）实证研究CoT令牌的作用，包括保留关键令牌、改变中间结果存储形式及随机干预CoT值的实验。

Result: 仅保留存储中间结果的令牌即可达到与完整CoT相当的性能；中间结果的存储形式不影响模型表现；随机干预CoT值会连锁影响后续令牌和答案。

Conclusion: CoT令牌可能像程序变量一样工作，但存在计算复杂度限制和潜在捷径问题，为理解CoT机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Chain-of-thoughts (CoT) requires large language models (LLMs) to generate
intermediate steps before reaching the final answer, and has been proven
effective to help LLMs solve complex reasoning tasks. However, the inner
mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically
study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit
multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving
these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate
results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that
storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect
model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice
that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly.
These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer
programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and
computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available
at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.

Result: 结果显示句法结构的假设不成立，且该论点难以推广到儿童语言和动物信号。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要重新评估幂律与层级结构之间的关系。

Abstract: Statistical analysis of corpora provides an approach to quantitatively
investigate natural languages. This approach has revealed that several power
laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the
universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of
correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical
structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been
extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument
supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this
problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic
structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse
trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English
corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic
context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as
in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the
assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to
apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting
the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical
structures.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LPC的新框架，通过离散潜代码建模人类偏好的隐含因素及其组合，解决了现有对齐算法依赖显式奖励函数的局限性。实验表明，LPC显著提升了多种对齐算法的性能，并增强了数据噪声下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好建模方法通常依赖明确或隐式的奖励函数，忽略了人类偏好可能包含跨任务和人群的复杂冲突因素，LPC旨在通过潜代码建模这些隐含因素。

Method: LPC利用离散潜代码建模偏好的隐含因素及其组合，无需预定义奖励函数或手工权重，可无缝集成多种离线对齐算法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LPC对三种对齐算法（DPO、SimPO、IPO）和三种基础模型（Mistral-7B、Llama3-8B等）均表现出性能提升，且潜代码能有效捕捉偏好分布差异并增强噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LPC为多因素偏好提供了统一表征，为LLM的负责任部署提供了更鲁棒和通用的对齐技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet aligning
their generations with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing
approaches to preference modeling often rely on an explicit or implicit reward
function, overlooking the intricate and multifaceted nature of human
preferences that may encompass conflicting factors across diverse tasks and
populations. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Preference Coding
(LPC), a novel framework that models the implicit factors as well as their
combinations behind holistic preferences using discrete latent codes. LPC
seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically
inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying
on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LPC consistently improves
upon three alignment algorithms (DPO, SimPO, and IPO) using three base models
(Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3-8B-Instruct). Furthermore, deeper analysis
reveals that the learned latent codes effectively capture the differences in
the distribution of human preferences and significantly enhance the robustness
of alignment against noise in data. By providing a unified representation for
the multifarious preference factors, LPC paves the way towards developing more
robust and versatile alignment techniques for the responsible deployment of
powerful LLMs.

Conclusion: InvICL成功解决了ICL的顺序敏感问题，为相关任务提供了一种高性能且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a pivotal capability of
auto-regressive large language models, yet it is hindered by a notable
sensitivity to the ordering of context examples regardless of their mutual
independence. To address this issue, recent studies have introduced several
variant algorithms of ICL that achieve permutation invariance. However, many of
these do not exhibit comparable performance with the standard auto-regressive
ICL algorithm. In this work, we identify two crucial elements in the design of
an invariant ICL algorithm: information non-leakage and context
interdependence, which are not simultaneously achieved by any of the existing
methods. These investigations lead us to the proposed Invariant ICL (InvICL), a
methodology designed to achieve invariance in ICL while ensuring the two
properties. Empirically, our findings reveal that InvICL surpasses previous
models, both invariant and non-invariant, in most benchmark datasets,
showcasing superior generalization capabilities across varying input lengths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在零样本学习下为群体推荐系统（GRS）生成推荐的表现，分析了组复杂度、提示格式等因素对准确性的影响。结果显示，性能在评分超过100时下降，但不同模型对复杂度敏感度不同。上下文学习（ICL）能显著提升性能，而其他提示修改（如生成解释）无显著影响。建议未来研究将组复杂度纳入评估标准，并指出较小LLM在适当条件下也能高效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLM）在零样本学习条件下如何正确执行群体推荐系统（GRS）中的社会选择聚合策略，并分析提示格式（如组偏好表达方式）对模型准确性的影响。

Method: 通过实验量化分析组复杂度（用户和商品数量）、不同LLM、提示条件（如上下文学习或生成解释）以及组偏好格式化方式（如按用户或商品排列评分列表）对推荐准确性的影响。

Result: 1. 评分超过100时性能下降，但不同模型对组复杂度敏感度不同；
2. 上下文学习（ICL）显著提升高复杂度下的准确性；
3. 其他提示修改（如添加解释或领域线索）无显著影响；
4. 组偏好格式化方式（如按用户或商品排列）影响准确性；
5. 较小LLM在优化条件下可高效生成推荐。

Conclusion: 组复杂度应作为GRS评估的关键因素；提示格式化和上下文学习对性能有重要影响；较小LLM在适当条件下可替代大模型，节省计算成本。未来研究需进一步优化LLM在复杂群体推荐场景中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in recommender systems
aimed at both individuals and groups. Previously, Group Recommender Systems
(GRS) often used social choice-based aggregation strategies to derive a single
recommendation based on the preferences of multiple people. In this paper, we
investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies
correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the
group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the
impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs,
different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating
explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that
performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings.
However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group
complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can
significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity,
while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting
for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research
should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect
on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios
differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy. All
in all, our study implies that smaller LLMs are capable of generating group
recommendations under the right conditions, making the case for using smaller
models that require less computing power and costs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为多阶段影响函数的方法，用于将微调后大语言模型的预测归因于预训练数据，并通过EK-FAC近似提升效率。实验验证了其可扩展性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于理解微调后大语言模型预测与预训练数据之间的关系，现有方法无法计算多阶段影响且难以扩展至十亿级参数模型。

Method: 方法包括提出多阶段影响函数，并利用EK-FAC参数化进行高效近似。

Result: 实证结果证实了EK-FAC近似的优秀可扩展性及多阶段影响函数的有效性，并通过案例研究展示了其解释能力。

Conclusion: 论文通过多阶段影响函数成功将下游任务预测归因于预训练数据，提供了新的解释角度。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are commonly fine-tuned to adapt to
downstream tasks. Since the majority of knowledge is acquired during
pre-training, attributing the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to their
pre-training data may provide valuable insights. Influence functions have been
proposed as a means to explain model predictions based on training data.
However, existing approaches fail to compute ``multi-stage'' influence and lack
scalability to billion-scale LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose the multi-stage influence function to attribute the
downstream predictions of fine-tuned LLMs to pre-training data under the
full-parameter fine-tuning paradigm. To enhance the efficiency and practicality
of our multi-stage influence function, we leverage Eigenvalue-corrected
Kronecker-Factored (EK-FAC) parameterization for efficient approximation.
Empirical results validate the superior scalability of EK-FAC approximation and
the effectiveness of our multi-stage influence function. Additionally, case
studies on a real-world LLM, dolly-v2-3b, demonstrate its interpretive power,
with exemplars illustrating insights provided by multi-stage influence
estimates. Our code is public at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了WiserUI-Bench基准和G-FOCUS策略，用于评估UI设计的说服力，减少对A/B测试的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UI设计评估依赖耗时且昂贵的A/B测试，而现有视觉语言模型未能有效比较设计的说服力。

Method: 引入了包含300个UI图像对的WiserUI-Bench，并提出G-FOCUS推理策略以减少位置偏差并提高评估准确性。

Result: 实验表明G-FOCUS在一致性和准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为UI设计的说服力评估提供了新方法，补充了A/B测试的不足。

Abstract: Evaluating user interface (UI) design effectiveness extends beyond aesthetics
to influencing user behavior, a principle central to Design Persuasiveness. A/B
testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive
higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current
approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative
persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this,
we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design
Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled
with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS,
a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based
persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation
accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference
strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through
promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an
approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI
preference modeling and design optimization. Code and data will be released
publicly.

different languages, and construct a dedicated balanced benchmark data set from
Twitter posts in Latvian along with their manual translations into English. We
compare our results to previous work and show that the more recently released
vision-language model checkpoints are becoming increasingly capable at this
task, but there is still much room for further improvement.

Motivation: 孟加拉语（一种低资源语言）中的消费者健康查询常含冗余信息，影响了医疗响应效率，研究旨在探索大型语言模型在无任务特定训练下的表现。

Method: 使用BanglaCHQ-Summ数据集（含2350组标注查询-摘要对），通过ROUGE指标比较九种LLMs与微调模型Bangla T5的零-shot总结性能。

Result: Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct在ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L上表现最佳，Bangla T5在ROUGE-2领先，表明零-shot LLMs可匹敌微调模型。

Conclusion: 零-shot LLMs在低资源语言中展现出高效总结能力，为医疗查询处理提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Consumer Health Queries (CHQs) in Bengali (Bangla), a low-resource language,
often contain extraneous details, complicating efficient medical responses.
This study investigates the zero-shot performance of nine advanced large
language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Llama3-70b-Instruct, Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct, Gemini-1.5-Pro,
Qwen2-72b-Instruct, Gemma-2-27b, and Athene-70B, in summarizing Bangla CHQs.
Using the BanglaCHQ-Summ dataset comprising 2,350 annotated query-summary
pairs, we benchmarked these LLMs using ROUGE metrics against Bangla T5, a
fine-tuned state-of-the-art model. Mixtral-8x22b-Instruct emerged as the top
performing model in ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L, while Bangla T5 excelled in ROUGE-2.
The results demonstrate that zero-shot LLMs can rival fine-tuned models,
achieving high-quality summaries even without task-specific training. This work
underscores the potential of LLMs in addressing challenges in low-resource
languages, providing scalable solutions for healthcare query summarization.

Result: 实证表明，MCP能有效控制FPR、显著提升检测性能，并增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MCP框架在保障低误报率的同时，实现了高性能和鲁棒性，为机器生成文本检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant
concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result,
developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical
priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on
detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false
positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal
Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While
directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction
in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a
Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal
Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection
performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that
spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling
superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances
detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks
across multiple detectors and datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过稀疏自编码器（SAE）分析大语言模型的多语言能力，提出新指标评估特征的单语言性，并发现某些特征与特定语言强相关。消融这些特征仅显著影响模型的一种语言能力，且多语言特征协同作用增强效果。最后利用这些特征优化控制向量，实现了对模型生成语言的精准控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如基于神经元或内部激活的分析）在多语言能力分析中存在叠加性和层间激活差异等问题，限制了可靠性。因此，需要更精细的方法（如SAE）来揭示语言特征。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分解大语言模型的激活为稀疏线性组合，提出单语言性评估指标，并通过特征消融实验验证其语言特异性。

Result: 发现某些SAE特征与特定语言强相关，消融这些特征仅影响对应语言能力；多语言特征协同消融效果更显著。利用这些特征优化控制向量，实现了语言生成的精准控制。

Conclusion: SAE提供了更可靠的多语言能力分析框架，揭示了语言特异性特征及其协同作用，为模型语言控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: The mechanisms behind multilingual capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been examined using neuron-based or internal-activation-based
methods. However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and
layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the
activations of LLMs into sparse linear combination of SAE features. We
introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from
SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific
languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only
significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost
unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE
features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating
individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific
features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language
generated by LLMs.

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言的MNER奠定了基础，并提供了标准化的数据集和基线模型。

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal content, particularly text and images on social
media, has positioned Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) as an
increasingly important area of research within Natural Language Processing.
Despite progress in high-resource languages such as English, MNER remains
underexplored for low-resource languages like Urdu. The primary challenges
include the scarcity of annotated multimodal datasets and the lack of
standardized baselines. To address these challenges, we introduce the U-MNER
framework and release the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, a pioneering resource for
Urdu MNER. Adapted from the widely used Twitter2015 dataset, it is annotated
with Urdu-specific grammar rules. We establish benchmark baselines by
evaluating both text-based and multimodal models on this dataset, providing
comparative analyses to support future research on Urdu MNER. The U-MNER
framework integrates textual and visual context using Urdu-BERT for text
embeddings and ResNet for visual feature extraction, with a Cross-Modal Fusion
Module to align and fuse information. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Twitter2015-Urdu dataset, laying the groundwork for further
MNER research in low-resource languages.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Chinese large language models (LLMs) underscores the
need for domain-specific evaluations to ensure reliable applications. However,
existing benchmarks often lack coverage in vertical domains and offer limited
insights into the Chinese working context. Leveraging qualification exams as a
unified framework for human expertise evaluation, we introduce QualBench, the
first multi-domain Chinese QA benchmark dedicated to localized assessment of
Chinese LLMs. The dataset includes over 17,000 questions across six vertical
domains, with data selections grounded in 24 Chinese qualifications to closely
align with national policies and working standards. Through comprehensive
evaluation, the Qwen2.5 model outperformed the more advanced GPT-4o, with
Chinese LLMs consistently surpassing non-Chinese models, highlighting the
importance of localized domain knowledge in meeting qualification requirements.
The best performance of 75.26% reveals the current gaps in domain coverage
within model capabilities. Furthermore, we present the failure of LLM
collaboration with crowdsourcing mechanisms and suggest the opportunities for
multi-domain RAG knowledge enhancement and vertical domain LLM training with
Federated Learning.

Result: T-T模型在ASTE任务中取得了当前最优性能，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: T-T模型通过创新的注意力机制和交互策略，有效解决了Transformer在长序列任务中的局限性，为ASTE任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed
of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences.
The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which
encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of
relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing
various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions
between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture
relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we
attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning
modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it
is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to
the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the
input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges:
overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the
tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention
mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former
modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local
attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different
attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the
T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art
performance with lower computational costs.

Abstract: In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational
technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative
processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are
inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at
enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to
exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the
concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of
relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative
dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in
argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based
technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.

Abstract: Data selection for instruction tuning is essential for improving the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) and reducing training cost.
However, existing automated selection methods either depend on computationally
expensive gradient-based measures or manually designed heuristics, which may
fail to fully exploit the intrinsic attributes of data. In this paper, we
propose In-context Learning for Contribution Measurement (ICon), a novel
gradient-free method that takes advantage of the implicit fine-tuning nature of
in-context learning (ICL) to measure sample contribution without gradient
computation or manual indicators engineering. ICon offers a computationally
efficient alternative to gradient-based methods and reduces human inductive
bias inherent in heuristic-based approaches. ICon comprises three components
and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under
implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12
benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of
ICon. Remarkably, on LLaMA3.1-8B, models trained on 15% of ICon-selected data
outperform full datasets by 5.42% points and exceed the best performance of
widely used selection methods by 2.06% points. We further analyze
high-contribution samples selected by ICon, which show both diverse tasks and
appropriate difficulty levels, rather than just the hardest ones.

Conclusion: 为实现自动化新闻的平衡报道，需开发有效的后训练缓解策略并建立更严格的评估框架。

Abstract: Framing in media critically shapes public perception by selectively
emphasizing some details while downplaying others. With the rise of large
language models in automated news and content creation, there is growing
concern that these systems may introduce or even amplify framing biases
compared to human authors. In this paper, we explore how framing manifests in
both out-of-the-box and fine-tuned LLM-generated news content. Our analysis
reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs
tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts. In
addition, we observe significant variation in framing tendencies across
different model architectures, with some models displaying notably higher
biases. These findings point to the need for effective post-training mitigation
strategies and tighter evaluation frameworks to ensure that automated news
content upholds the standards of balanced reporting.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了英语推理微调在多语言环境中的泛化能力，发现计算资源的增加可以提升低资源语言的数学推理能力，但对文化常识推理的泛化能力较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索英语为中心的推理微调是否能在多语言环境中有效泛化，尤其是在数学推理和常识推理方面。

Method: 通过扩展推理计算资源，研究英语为中心的推理语言模型在多语言（包括低资源语言）中的表现，并分析其推理模式和语言控制策略。

Result: 计算资源增加显著提升了多语言数学推理能力，但对文化常识推理的泛化能力较差。高资源语言的推理效率和质量更高。

Conclusion: 建议在高资源语言中使用英语为中心的推理模型，同时需进一步改进低资源语言和跨领域推理的能力。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities of large language models are primarily studied for
English, even when pretrained models are multilingual. In this work, we
investigate to what extent English reasoning finetuning with long
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) can generalize across languages. First, we find that
scaling up inference compute for English-centric reasoning language models
(RLMs) improves multilingual mathematical reasoning across many languages
including low-resource languages, to an extent where they outperform models
twice their size. Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are
naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think
pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an
effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we
observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource
languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in
particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English.
Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the
limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time
scaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason
in high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning
in low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts.

TL;DR: Chain-of-thought (CoT) 监测在AI安全中具有潜力，但其忠实性有限，无法完全捕捉模型的推理过程，尤其在罕见或灾难性行为中效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估CoT监测是否能真实反映模型的推理过程，以验证其在AI安全中的应用潜力。

Method: 通过测试6种提示下的CoT忠实性，结合强化学习分析其对模型行为的影响。

Result: CoT揭示提示使用率的比例较低（1%-20%），强化学习提升忠实性但存在天花板效应，且未增加提示的口头表达。

Conclusion: CoT监测在训练和评估中有价值，但不足以完全排除不良行为，尤其在非必要CoT场景中可靠性有限。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) offers a potential boon for AI safety as it allows
monitoring a model's CoT to try to understand its intentions and reasoning
processes. However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs
faithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT
faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints
presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested,
CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the
hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement
learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and
(3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward
hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without
training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a
promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations,
but that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in
settings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring
of CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected
behaviors.

*Ran Zhang,Wei Zhao,Lieve Macken,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransProQA是一种新颖的、基于LLM的无参考QA框架，专注于文学翻译评估，优于现有指标并接近人类评估水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有评估指标过于关注机械准确性而忽视艺术表达，导致机器翻译被高估的问题。

Method: 结合专业文学翻译和研究者的见解，设计无参考QA框架，评估文学质量的关键要素如文学手法、文化理解和作者风格。

Result: TransProQA显著优于当前指标，相关性增益达0.07，在充分性评估中超过最优SOTA指标15分以上。

Conclusion: TransProQA具有广泛适用性，可作为无需训练的文学评估工具，并接近人类评估水平。

Abstract: The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary
domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy
over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being
superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this
bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural
authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary
evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based
question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary
translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from
professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical
elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural
understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while
literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially
outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ
and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by
over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator
insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of
translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation
performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad
applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b,
indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation
metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing
due to copyright or ethical considerations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个高效的数据过滤流程，解决了模型驱动数据过滤中的两大挑战：高效数据验证和高质种子数据选择，显著提升了LLMs的性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，数据质量成为提升模型性能的关键因素。然而，现有模型驱动的数据过滤方法存在数据验证效率低和种子数据选择主观性强的两大挑战。

Method: 为解决数据验证问题，论文提出了一种高效验证策略；针对种子数据选择，结合验证策略优化了正负样本选择，并提出轻量级分类器（fastText）构建高效过滤流程。

Result: 应用该流程在FineWeb和Chinese FineWeb数据集上生成了更高质量的Ultra-FineWeb数据集。实验表明，基于Ultra-FineWeb训练的LLMs在多个基准任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的数据过滤流程不仅能高效筛选高质量数据，还显著降低了实验和推理成本，验证了其在提升数据质量和训练效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the
rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering
has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data.
However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data
verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data
quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks
clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of
subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient
verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on
LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge,
we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM
training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize
the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data
filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency,
classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental
and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we
employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the
filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese
FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb
dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120
billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on
Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple
benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both
data quality and training efficiency.

Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立评估对话系统组件，限制了跨架构和配置的通用性，希望提出统一框架以提升评估的系统性和可比性。

Method: 提出clem todd框架，支持灵活组合用户模拟器和对话系统，确保数据集、评估指标和计算约束一致，并集成现有及新系统进行评估。

Result: 通过clem todd重新评估现有系统并整合新系统，发现架构、模型规模和提示策略对对话性能的影响。

Conclusion: clem todd为构建高效对话系统提供了实用指导，框架的灵活性和统一性有助于系统化评估和优化。

Abstract: The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced
the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and
robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often
evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user
simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights
across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd
(chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a
flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under
consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across
combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models
from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration
and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational
constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing
task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three
newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results
provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting
strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for
building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.

human-annotated misleading narratives which circulated during the UK General
Elections in 2019 and 2024. We also benchmark Pre-trained and Large Language
Models (focusing on GPT-4o), studying their effectiveness in detecting
election-related misleading narratives. Finally, we discuss potential use cases
and make recommendations for future research directions using the proposed
codebook and dataset.

Motivation: 探索如何结合视觉感知与语言模型的推理能力，并理解这两种能力在视觉语言模型中的相互作用机制。

Method: 采用跨模态模型融合方法，将大型语言模型的推理能力迁移至视觉语言模型中，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验表明，模型融合能有效迁移推理能力，感知能力主要集中在模型早期层，而推理能力则分布在中后层。融合后所有层均参与推理，感知分布不变。

Conclusion: 模型融合是实现多模态集成与解释的有效工具，为理解视觉语言模型的内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general
capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain
poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning
through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike
previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose
merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities
from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged
models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how
merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly
encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely
facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all
layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception
abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed
light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration
and interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接对齐方法存在冗长和似然位移问题，主要源于噪声偏好对导致似然相似。本文旨在改进这些问题。

Method: 提出基于比较预言机的偏好对齐方法，并通过启发式改进和实验验证其灵活性和兼容性。

Result: 在多个基准模型（如Mistral-7B、Llama-3-8B等）和评测集（如AlpacaEval 2）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为现有直接对齐方法的局限性提供了有效替代方案，并强调了为不同似然边界的偏好对设计专门方法的重要性。

Abstract: Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the
issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the
noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and
dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we
propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and
provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our
method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the
flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance
of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple
base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with
benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show
the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations
of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we
evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs
with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in
\citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MatMMFuse的多模态融合模型，结合了晶体图卷积网络(CGCNN)和SciBERT模型，通过多头注意力机制提升材料特性预测性能。实验显示，该模型在多个关键属性上均优于单一模态模型，尤其在小样本数据集上表现优异。

Method: 提出MatMMFuse模型，采用多头注意力机制融合CGCNN的结构感知嵌入和SciBERT的文本嵌入，端到端训练于Materials Project数据集。

Result: 在形成能、带隙等四个关键属性上，MatMMFuse比单一CGCNN和SciBERT模型分别提升40%和68%的预测性能，并在小样本数据集上展现了更好的零样本学习能力。

Conclusion: 多模态融合模型显著提升了材料特性预测的准确性和泛化能力，适用于工业应用中数据稀缺的场景。

Abstract: The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for
high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful.
However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the
advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different
representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can
encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models.
Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text
encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal
symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a
fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the
combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution
Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model
in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We
show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN
and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap,
energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of
40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model
for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the
zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of
Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the
proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain
vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model
for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is
prohibitively expensive.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个在训练数据标签被污染时的鲁棒不确定性量化框架，包括改进的PCP方法和新的UI方法，最终整合为三重鲁棒框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标签被噪声或缺失污染的情况下，传统的一致性预测方法因数据分布偏移而失效，需要新的方法保证预测的统计有效性。

Method: 改进PCP方法以应对权重估计不准确的情况，并引入UI方法通过不确定性保留的标签插补替代权重估计。

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，PCP对权重误差具有鲁棒性，UI方法在无需权重估计的情况下同样有效，整合后的三重框架进一步提升了稳健性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在标签污染的复杂场景下仍能提供有效的不确定性量化，且三重框架通过方法冗余确保了更高的可靠性。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for robust uncertainty quantification in situations
where labeled training data are corrupted, through noisy or missing labels. We
build on conformal prediction, a statistical tool for generating prediction
sets that cover the test label with a pre-specified probability. The validity
of conformal prediction, however, holds under the i.i.d assumption, which does
not hold in our setting due to the corruptions in the data. To account for this
distribution shift, the privileged conformal prediction (PCP) method proposed
leveraging privileged information (PI) -- additional features available only
during training -- to re-weight the data distribution, yielding valid
prediction sets under the assumption that the weights are accurate. In this
work, we analyze the robustness of PCP to inaccuracies in the weights. Our
analysis indicates that PCP can still yield valid uncertainty estimates even
when the weights are poorly estimated. Furthermore, we introduce uncertain
imputation (UI), a new conformal method that does not rely on weight
estimation. Instead, we impute corrupted labels in a way that preserves their
uncertainty. Our approach is supported by theoretical guarantees and validated
empirically on both synthetic and real benchmarks. Finally, we show that these
techniques can be integrated into a triply robust framework, ensuring
statistically valid predictions as long as at least one underlying method is
valid.

TL;DR: 提出SetONet，一种基于Deep Sets的新型神经网络架构，解决了标准DeepONet在输入函数采样点固定时的局限性，提升了在可变传感器配置、缺失数据或不规则网格下的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DeepONet在处理输入函数时要求固定采样点，这限制了其在传感器配置变化、数据缺失或不规则网格场景中的应用。本文旨在设计一种更灵活、稳健的算子学习方法。

Method: 将Deep Sets原则融入DeepONet框架，设计SetONet分支网络，通过无序的位置-值对集合处理输入函数，实现排列不变性和对传感器变化的鲁棒性。

Result: SetONet在导数/反导数算子、1D Darcy流和2D弹性问题等基准测试中表现优异，能在标准DeepONet失效的可变采样条件下成功学习算子，且在传感器缺失时无需插值即可保持功能。

Conclusion: SetONet扩展了神经网络算子工具包的适用性，显著提升了在输入数据可变或不完整问题中的实用性，尤其在非线性问题上表现更优。

Abstract: Neural operators, particularly the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), have
shown promise in learning mappings between function spaces for solving
differential equations. However, standard DeepONet requires input functions to
be sampled at fixed locations, limiting its applicability in scenarios with
variable sensor configurations, missing data, or irregular grids. We introduce
the Set Operator Network (SetONet), a novel architecture that integrates Deep
Sets principles into the DeepONet framework to address this limitation. The
core innovation lies in the SetONet branch network, which processes the input
function as an unordered \emph{set} of location-value pairs. This design
ensures permutation invariance with respect to the input points, making SetONet
inherently robust to variations in the number and locations of sensors. SetONet
learns richer, spatially-aware input representations by explicitly processing
spatial coordinates and function values. We demonstrate SetONet's effectiveness
on several benchmark problems, including derivative/anti-derivative operators,
1D Darcy flow, and 2D elasticity. Results show that SetONet successfully learns
operators under variable input sampling conditions where standard DeepONet
fails. Furthermore, SetONet is architecturally robust to sensor drop-off;
unlike standard DeepONet, which requires methods like interpolation to function
with missing data. Notably, SetONet can achieve comparable or improved accuracy
over DeepONet on fixed grids, particularly for nonlinear problems, likely due
to its enhanced input representation. SetONet provides a flexible and robust
extension to the neural operator toolkit, significantly broadening the
applicability of operator learning to problems with variable or incomplete
input data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练数据中‘质量’的定义，尤其是毒性数据在预训练和后训练共同设计中的作用，以验证‘坏数据可能产生好模型’的假设。

Method: 通过玩具实验研究数据组成对表示空间几何的影响，并利用Olmo-1B模型在不同毒性数据比例下的实验，分析毒性在表示空间中的线性可分性。

Result: 毒性数据比例增加会使毒性概念在表示空间中更线性可分，虽然基础模型的生成毒性增加，但通过后训练技术（如推理时干预）可以更容易降低毒性，同时保持模型的其他能力。

Conclusion: 在考虑后训练的情况下，预训练数据中包含一定比例的毒性数据可以优化模型在毒性和通用能力之间的平衡，支持‘坏数据可能产生好模型’的观点。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) pretraining, data quality is believed to
determine model quality. In this paper, we re-examine the notion of "quality"
from the perspective of pre- and post-training co-design. Specifically, we
explore the possibility that pre-training on more toxic data can lead to better
control in post-training, ultimately decreasing a model's output toxicity.
First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the
geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled
experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic
data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear
representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show
that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model,
it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real
Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better
trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general
capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention
(ITI) are applied. Our findings suggest that, with post-training taken into
account, bad data may lead to good models.

Conclusion: 该算法为随机优化问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，尤其适用于需要利用上下文信息的复杂决策场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to contextual stochastic optimization,
integrating operations research and machine learning to address decision-making
under uncertainty. Traditional methods often fail to leverage contextual
information, which underscores the necessity for new algorithms. In this study,
we utilize neural networks with combinatorial optimization layers to encode
policies. Our goal is to minimize the empirical risk, which is estimated from
past data on uncertain parameters and contexts. To that end, we present a
surrogate learning problem and a generic primal-dual algorithm that is
applicable to various combinatorial settings in stochastic optimization. Our
approach extends classic Fenchel-Young loss results and introduces a new
regularization method using sparse perturbations on the distribution simplex.
This allows for tractable updates in the original space and can accommodate
diverse objective functions. We demonstrate the linear convergence of our
algorithm under certain conditions and provide a bound on the non-optimality of
the resulting policy in terms of the empirical risk. Experiments on a
contextual stochastic minimum weight spanning tree problem show that our
algorithm is efficient and scalable, achieving performance comparable to
imitation learning of solutions computed using an expensive Lagrangian-based
heuristic.

values are computed post-hoc, leading to additional computational cost at
inference time. To overcome this, a novel method, called ViaSHAP, is proposed,
that learns a function to compute Shapley values, from which the predictions
can be derived directly by summation. Two approaches to implement the proposed
method are explored; one based on the universal approximation theorem and the
other on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Results from a
large-scale empirical investigation are presented, showing that ViaSHAP using
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms for
tabular data. It is also shown that the explanations of ViaSHAP are
significantly more accurate than the popular approximator FastSHAP on both
tabular data and images.

Conclusion: 该方法为公平性审计提供了新的理论基础，并推动了更健壮的审计研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of ML decision-making systems across products and services
has led to a set of regulations on how such systems should behave and be built.
Among all the technical challenges to enforcing these regulations, one crucial,
yet under-explored problem is the risk of manipulation while these systems are
being audited for fairness. This manipulation occurs when a platform
deliberately alters its answers to a regulator to pass an audit without
modifying its answers to other users. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach to manipulation-proof auditing by taking into account the auditor's
prior knowledge of the task solved by the platform. We first demonstrate that
regulators must not rely on public priors (e.g. a public dataset), as platforms
could easily fool the auditor in such cases. We then formally establish the
conditions under which an auditor can prevent audit manipulations using prior
knowledge about the ground truth. Finally, our experiments with two standard
datasets exemplify the maximum level of unfairness a platform can hide before
being detected as malicious. Our formalization and generalization of
manipulation-proof auditing with a prior opens up new research directions for
more robust fairness audits.

Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective
regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling.
However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and
geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision
Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation
model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates
two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture
with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust
prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces
self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence
processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters
across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and
92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global
resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution
benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98
to 0.99 against observation data.

Motivation: 现有的谱GNN因使用低次多项式滤波器可能无法充分捕捉图的谱特性，且增加多项式次数计算成本高且效果不佳。

Method: 提出PieCoN，结合恒定和多项式滤波器，并通过自适应划分频谱区间以更灵活学习谱特性。

Result: 在9个基准数据集（包括同质性和异质性图）上的实验表明，PieCoN在异质性数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: PieCoN提供了一种更灵活的图结构学习方法，特别适用于异质性图，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various
domains by leveraging graph structures in data. Existing spectral GNNs, which
use low-degree polynomial filters to capture graph spectral properties, may not
fully identify the graph's spectral characteristics because of the polynomial's
small degree. However, increasing the polynomial degree is computationally
expensive and beyond certain thresholds leads to performance plateaus or
degradation. In this paper, we introduce the Piecewise Constant Spectral Graph
Neural Network(PieCoN) to address these challenges. PieCoN combines constant
spectral filters with polynomial filters to provide a more flexible way to
leverage the graph structure. By adaptively partitioning the spectrum into
intervals, our approach increases the range of spectral properties that can be
effectively learned. Experiments on nine benchmark datasets, including both
homophilic and heterophilic graphs, demonstrate that PieCoN is particularly
effective on heterophilic datasets, highlighting its potential for a wide range
of applications.

Conclusion: ProteinGuide为蛋白质生成模型的统计条件化提供了一个严格且通用的框架，能够有效指导生成具有特定属性的序列。

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have begun to transform protein
engineering, yet no principled framework for conditioning on auxiliary
information in a plug-and-play manner exists; one may want to iteratively
incorporate experimental feedback, or make use of an existing classifier --
such as for predicting enzyme commission number -- in order to guide the
sampling of the generative model to generate sequences with desired properties.
Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a rigorous and general framework to achieve
just that: through unifying a broad class of protein generative models that
includes masked language, (order-agnostic) autoregressive, diffusion and
flow-matching models, we provide an approach to statistically condition
pre-trained protein generative models. We demonstrate applicability of our
approach by guiding each of two commonly used protein generative models,
ProteinMPNN and ESM3, to generate amino acid and structure token sequences
conditioned on several user-specified properties, namely, enhanced stability
and CATH-labeled fold generation.

Motivation: 当前的RL方法在微调LLM推理器时放弃了学习到的价值函数，转而依赖经验估计的回报，这限制了依赖于价值函数验证的测试时计算扩展能力。

Method: RL^V通过联合训练LLM作为推理器和生成验证器，利用RL生成的数据，在不过多增加开销的情况下增加了验证能力。

Result: RL^V在并行采样下将MATH准确性提高了20%以上，测试时计算效率比基础RL方法提升了8-32倍，并且在易到难和域外任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RL^V在联合扩展并行和顺序测试时计算时表现出更高的性能，适用于长推理模型，是一种高效且通用的RL增强技术。

Abstract: Prevalent reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for fine-tuning LLM reasoners,
such as GRPO or Leave-one-out PPO, abandon the learned value function in favor
of empirically estimated returns. This hinders test-time compute scaling that
relies on using the value-function for verification. In this work, we propose
RL$^V$ that augments any ``value-free'' RL method by jointly training the LLM
as both a reasoner and a generative verifier using RL-generated data, adding
verification capabilities without significant overhead. Empirically, RL$^V$
boosts MATH accuracy by over 20\% with parallel sampling and enables
$8-32\times$ efficient test-time compute scaling compared to the base RL
method. RL$^V$ also exhibits strong generalization capabilities for both
easy-to-hard and out-of-domain tasks. Furthermore, RL$^V$ achieves
$1.2-1.6\times$ higher performance when jointly scaling parallel and sequential
test-time compute with a long reasoning R1 model.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) in cyber physical systems (CPS) is a
complex task due to the challenges that arise in terms of real-time decision
making, safety, reliability, device heterogeneity, and data privacy. There are
also open research questions that must be addressed in order to fully realize
the potential of ML in CPS. Federated learning (FL), a distributed approach to
ML, has become increasingly popular in recent years. It allows models to be
trained using data from decentralized sources. This approach has been gaining
popularity in the CPS field, as it integrates computer, communication, and
physical processes. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to provide a
comprehensive analysis of the most recent developments of FL-CPS, including the
numerous application areas, system topologies, and algorithms developed in
recent years. The paper starts by discussing recent advances in both FL and
CPS, followed by their integration. Then, the paper compares the application of
FL in CPS with its applications in the internet of things (IoT) in further
depth to show their connections and distinctions. Furthermore, the article
scrutinizes how FL is utilized in critical CPS applications, e.g., intelligent
transportation systems, cybersecurity services, smart cities, and smart
healthcare solutions. The study also includes critical insights and lessons
learned from various FL-CPS implementations. The paper's concluding section
delves into significant concerns and suggests avenues for further research in
this fast-paced and dynamic era.

<details>

Motivation: 现有压缩方法（如事后修剪或基于采样的选择）可能破坏推理连贯性或无法有效干预生成过程。冗余输出会增加计算开销并降低用户体验。

Method: 提出ConCISE框架，包括自信注入（稳定中间步骤）和提前终止（自信足够时停止推理），通过微调模型实现压缩。

Result: 实验表明，ConCISE显著缩短输出（长度减少约50%），同时保持高任务准确性，并在多推理基准上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 自信引导的压缩能有效减少冗余，提升LRM的推理效率，为高效生成提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) perform strongly in complex reasoning tasks via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but often suffer from verbose outputs caused
by redundant content, increasing computational overhead, and degrading user
experience. Existing compression methods either operate post-hoc pruning,
risking disruption to reasoning coherence, or rely on sampling-based selection,
which fails to intervene effectively during generation. In this work, we
introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant
reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the
model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination
Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based
on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In
Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains
by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the
generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to
stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when
confidence is sufficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning
LRMs on ConCISE-generated data yields significantly shorter outputs, reducing
length by up to approximately 50% under SimPO, while maintaining high task
accuracy. ConCISE consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了联邦学习（FL）中隐私信息保护的问题，提出了一种名为FedRE的方法，通过优化本地差分隐私（LDP）保护机制，实现了对隐私敏感信息（PSI）的严格保护，同时减少了不必要的噪声对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FL通过梯度聚合防止原始数据的隐私泄露，上传的梯度仍可能泄露隐私信息。现有方法未能考虑客户对PSI的个性化隐私需求和数据的非均匀分布，导致过度保护和非必要噪声影响模型性能。

Method: 论文首先定义了PSI并优化了LDP，为高PSI梯度分配较少的隐私预算，逐层提供更严格的隐私保护。此外，设计了一个基于扰动信息分布的参数聚合机制以减少LDP对性能的影响。

Result: 在T-SROIE和DocTamper数据集上的文本篡改检测实验中，FedRE取得了与最先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: FedRE通过优化LDP隐私保护机制，有效平衡了隐私保护和模型性能，适用于FL中对不同类型数据的个性化隐私需求。

Abstract: Despite Federated Learning (FL) employing gradient aggregation at the server
for distributed training to prevent the privacy leakage of raw data, private
information can still be divulged through the analysis of uploaded gradients
from clients. Substantial efforts have been made to integrate local
differential privacy (LDP) into the system to achieve a strict privacy
guarantee. However, existing methods fail to take practical issues into account
by merely perturbing each sample with the same mechanism while each client may
have their own privacy preferences on privacy-sensitive information (PSI),
which is not uniformly distributed across the raw data. In such a case,
excessive privacy protection from private-insensitive information can
additionally introduce unnecessary noise, which may degrade the model
performance. In this work, we study the PSI within data and develop FedRE, that
can simultaneously achieve robustness and effectiveness benefits with LDP
protection. More specifically, we first define PSI with regard to the privacy
preferences of each client. Then, we optimize the LDP by allocating less
privacy budget to gradients with higher PSI in a layer-wise manner, thus
providing a stricter privacy guarantee for PSI. Furthermore, to mitigate the
performance degradation caused by LDP, we design a parameter aggregation
mechanism based on the distribution of the perturbed information. We conducted
experiments with text tamper detection on T-SROIE and DocTamper datasets, and
FedRE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在四个scRNA-seq数据集上，CCCVAE提升了聚类性能，评估得分高于传统VAE基线。

Conclusion: 研究表明将生物学先验嵌入深度生成模型对无监督单细胞分析具有重要价值。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular
heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological
function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling
interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular
behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role
in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune
response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information
about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational
autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell
representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived
from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes
biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs
that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to
reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context.
Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves
clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE
baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into
deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of 5G has transformed vehicular networks, offering high
bandwidth, low latency, and fast data rates essential for real-time
applications in smart cities and vehicles. These improvements enhance traffic
safety and entertainment services. However, the limited coverage and frequent
handovers in 5G networks cause network instability, especially in high-mobility
environments due to the ping-pong effect. This paper presents TH-GCN
(Throughput-oriented Graph Convolutional Network), a novel approach for
optimizing handover management in dense 5G networks. Using graph neural
networks (GNNs), TH-GCN models vehicles and base stations as nodes in a dynamic
graph enriched with features such as signal quality, throughput, vehicle speed,
and base station load. By integrating both user equipment and base station
perspectives, this dual-centric approach enables adaptive, real-time handover
decisions that improve network stability. Simulation results show that TH-GCN
reduces handovers by up to 78 percent and improves signal quality by 10
percent, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: 该理论为有限宽度多层级神经网络提供了更全面的分析框架，揭示了梯度下降在训练和泛化中的新特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the first precise distributional characterization
of gradient descent iterates for general multi-layer neural networks under the
canonical single-index regression model, in the `finite-width proportional
regime' where the sample size and feature dimension grow proportionally while
the network width and depth remain bounded. Our non-asymptotic state evolution
theory captures Gaussian fluctuations in first-layer weights and concentration
in deeper-layer weights, and remains valid for non-Gaussian features.
  Our theory differs from existing neural tangent kernel (NTK), mean-field (MF)
theories and tensor program (TP) in several key aspects. First, our theory
operates in the finite-width regime whereas these existing theories are
fundamentally infinite-width. Second, our theory allows weights to evolve from
individual initializations beyond the lazy training regime, whereas NTK and MF
are either frozen at or only weakly sensitive to initialization, and TP relies
on special initialization schemes. Third, our theory characterizes both
training and generalization errors for general multi-layer neural networks
beyond the uniform convergence regime, whereas existing theories study
generalization almost exclusively in two-layer settings.
  As a statistical application, we show that vanilla gradient descent can be
augmented to yield consistent estimates of the generalization error at each
iteration, which can be used to guide early stopping and hyperparameter tuning.
As a further theoretical implication, we show that despite model
misspecification, the model learned by gradient descent retains the structure
of a single-index function with an effective signal determined by a linear
combination of the true signal and the initialization.

Result: VaCDA在跨位置和跨设备场景中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VaCDA通过联合VAE和对比学习，有效减少数据异构性，提升跨领域活动识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Technological advancements have led to the rise of wearable devices with
sensors that continuously monitor user activities, generating vast amounts of
unlabeled data. This data is challenging to interpret, and manual annotation is
labor-intensive and error-prone. Additionally, data distribution is often
heterogeneous due to device placement, type, and user behavior variations. As a
result, traditional transfer learning methods perform suboptimally, making it
difficult to recognize daily activities. To address these challenges, we use a
variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a shared, low-dimensional latent space
from available sensor data. This space generalizes data across diverse sensors,
mitigating heterogeneity and aiding robust adaptation to the target domain. We
integrate contrastive learning to enhance feature representation by aligning
instances of the same class across domains while separating different classes.
We propose Variational Contrastive Domain Adaptation (VaCDA), a multi-source
domain adaptation framework combining VAEs and contrastive learning to improve
feature representation and reduce heterogeneity between source and target
domains. We evaluate VaCDA on multiple publicly available datasets across three
heterogeneity scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, and cross-device. VaCDA
outperforms the baselines in cross-position and cross-device scenarios.

Abstract: Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in
weather prediction, most of them overlook either the \textbf{physics} of the
underlying weather evolution or the \textbf{topology} of the Earth's surface.
In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted
And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT
attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process
that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes
equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model
and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into
consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these
considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the
Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph
neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the
initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation
from the same spherical graph neural network. In the $5.625^\circ$-resolution
ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based
weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction
model IFS T42. Code and checkpoint are available at

Abstract: Trustworthy depression prediction based on deep learning, incorporating both
predictive reliability and algorithmic fairness across diverse demographic
groups, is crucial for clinical application. Recently, achieving reliable
depression predictions through uncertainty quantification has attracted
increasing attention. However, few studies have focused on the fairness of
uncertainty quantification (UQ) in depression prediction. In this work, we
investigate the algorithmic fairness of UQ, namely Equal Opportunity Coverage
(EOC) fairness, and propose Fair Uncertainty Quantification (FUQ) for
depression prediction. FUQ pursues reliable and fair depression predictions
through group-based analysis. Specifically, we first group all the participants
by different sensitive attributes and leverage conformal prediction to quantify
uncertainty within each demographic group, which provides a theoretically
guaranteed and valid way to quantify uncertainty for depression prediction and
facilitates the investigation of fairness across different demographic groups.
Furthermore, we propose a fairness-aware optimization strategy that formulates
fairness as a constrained optimization problem under EOC constraints. This
enables the model to preserve predictive reliability while adapting to the
heterogeneous uncertainty levels across demographic groups, thereby achieving
optimal fairness. Through extensive evaluations on several visual and audio
depression datasets, our approach demonstrates its effectiveness.

### [70] [Structural Alignment in Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04939)
*Jeffrey Seathrún Sardina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图结构优先而非嵌入优先的视角来重新分析知识图谱(KG)的链接预测任务，并通过实验验证了其可行性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱通常是不完整的，现有链接预测方法主要依赖节点和边的嵌入表示，但论文认为从整体三元组结构出发可能更有效。

Method: 通过文献综述和两组核心实验，论文从结构优先的视角分析了知识图谱的链接预测，并提出了Structural Alignment Hypothesis。

Result: 实验证明结构优先的视角不仅可行，还能帮助理解KG学习并支持跨KG的迁移学习。

Conclusion: 论文认为链接预测本质上是一个结构性任务，所有代码和数据均已开源。

Abstract: While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become increasingly popular across various
scientific disciplines for their ability to model and interlink huge quantities
of data, essentially all real-world KGs are known to be incomplete. As such,
with the growth of KG use has been a concurrent development of machine learning
tools designed to predict missing information in KGs, which is referred to as
the Link Prediction Task. The majority of state-of-the-art link predictors to
date have followed an embedding-based paradigm. In this paradigm, it is assumed
that the information content of a KG is best represented by the (individual)
vector representations of its nodes and edges, and that therefore node and edge
embeddings are particularly well-suited to performing link prediction.
  This thesis proposes an alternative perspective on the field's approach to
link prediction and KG data modelling. Specifically, this work re-analyses KGs
and state-of-the-art link predictors from a graph-structure-first perspective
that models the information content of a KG in terms of whole triples, rather
than individual nodes and edges.
  Following a literature review and two core sets of experiments, this thesis
concludes that a structure-first perspective on KGs and link prediction is both
viable and useful for understanding KG learning and for enabling cross-KG
transfer learning for the link prediction task. This observation is used to
create and propose the Structural Alignment Hypothesis, which postulates that
link prediction can be understood and modelled as a structural task.
  All code and data used for this thesis are open-sourced. This thesis was
written bilingually, with the main document in English and an informal extended
summary in Irish. An Irish-language translation dictionary of machine learning
terms (the Focl\'oir Tr\'achtais) created for this work is open-sourced as
well.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Graffe的自监督扩散模型，用于图表示学习。通过理论证明和经验验证，展示了扩散模型在图表示学习中的有效性，并在多个真实数据集上取得了state-of-the-art性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型（DPMs）在生成高质量样本方面表现优异，但其在图表示学习中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过将扩散模型引入图表示学习，探索其在捕获视觉语义之外的新潜力。

Method: 提出Graffe模型，包含一个图编码器和一个扩散解码器。图编码器将源图压缩为紧凑表示，作为扩散解码器去噪过程的指导条件。理论证明了去噪目标隐含地最大化数据与其表示的条件互信息。

Result: Graffe在节点和图分类任务中表现优异，11个真实数据集中的9个取得了state-of-the-art性能，验证了扩散模型在图表示学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型作为一种强大的生成模型，可有效用于图表示学习。Graffe的成功表明DPMs在这一领域具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), widely recognized for their potential
to generate high-quality samples, tend to go unnoticed in representation
learning. While recent progress has highlighted their potential for capturing
visual semantics, adapting DPMs to graph representation learning remains in its
infancy. In this paper, we introduce Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model
proposed for graph representation learning. It features a graph encoder that
distills a source graph into a compact representation, which, in turn, serves
as the condition to guide the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we first explore the theoretical
foundations of applying diffusion models to representation learning, proving
that the denoising objective implicitly maximizes the conditional mutual
information between data and its representation. Specifically, we prove that
the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss is a tractable
lower bound for the conditional mutual information. Empirically, we conduct a
series of case studies to validate our theoretical insights. In addition,
Graffe delivers competitive results under the linear probing setting on node
and graph classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 9 of
the 11 real-world datasets. These findings indicate that powerful generative
models, especially diffusion models, serve as an effective tool for graph
representation learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应变换方法General Transform (GT)，通过数据驱动的映射替代传统离散变换，在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散变换（如傅里叶变换）虽广泛用于机器学习，但其选择依赖于对数据集特性的了解，而在缺乏此类知识时效果有限。因此需要一种无需先验知识的自适应变换方法。

Method: 提出General Transform (GT)，一种数据驱动的自适应变换表示，通过学习适合数据集和任务的特异性映射来提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，采用GT的模型在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中均优于传统变换方法。

Conclusion: GT作为一种通用、自适应的变换框架，可有效提升机器学习任务性能，尤其在缺乏领域知识时更具优势。

Abstract: Discrete transforms, such as the discrete Fourier transform, are widely used
in machine learning to improve model performance by extracting meaningful
features. However, with numerous transforms available, selecting an appropriate
one often depends on understanding the dataset's properties, making the
approach less effective when such knowledge is unavailable. In this work, we
propose General Transform (GT), an adaptive transform-based representation
designed for machine learning applications. Unlike conventional transforms, GT
learns data-driven mapping tailored to the dataset and task of interest. Here,
we demonstrate that models incorporating GT outperform conventional
transform-based approaches across computer vision and natural language
processing tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in diverse learning scenarios.

### [73] [Graph Neural Network Aided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation in Dynamic Terahertz UAV Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04981)
*Zhifeng Hu,Chong Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）和深度强化学习（DRL）的算法GLOVE，用于解决太赫兹无人机网络中的资源分配问题，旨在最大化资源效率（RE）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太赫兹无人机网络因动态拓扑和资源分配问题（混合整数非线性规划，MINLP）而难以高效分配功率和天线阵列资源。需要一种新方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: GLOVE算法通过GNN学习无人机与邻无人机的关系，同时强调自身节点特征，并利用多任务结构协同训练功率和子阵列资源分配决策。

Result: 实验表明，GLOVE在资源效率和延迟方面优于基准方案，且在训练过程中保持零丢包，展现了更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GLOVE为动态太赫兹无人机网络提供了高效的资源分配解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks with flexible
topologies and ultra-high data rates are expected to empower numerous
applications in security surveillance, disaster response, and environmental
monitoring, among others. However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient
long-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among
UAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of
antennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer
nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness.
Inspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a
graph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the
dynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is
proposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization.
When training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship
between this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the
important self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure
is leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for
the power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that
GLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest
latency. Moreover, unlike the benchmark methods with severe packet loss, GLOVE
maintains zero packet loss during the entire training process, demonstrating
its better robustness under the highly dynamic THz UAV network.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于键盘动态行为的连续认证系统，通过模拟不同键盘类型的输入数据，评估了两种机器学习方法在用户验证中的表现，结果表明随机森林在同类键盘认证中表现优异，但跨键盘认证效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索键盘动态行为在连续认证系统中的可行性，以提升多因素认证的安全性且不影响用户体验。

Method: 采用基于Agent的模型模拟机械和薄膜键盘的输入数据，捕捉按键特征（停留时间、间隔时间、错误率），并评估One-Class SVM和随机森林两种方法的性能。

Result: 随机森林在同类键盘用户识别中准确率超过0.7，但跨键盘认证效果较差；One-Class SVM表现不佳，无法区分同组用户。

Conclusion: 键盘硬件显著影响认证效果，需针对不同键盘建立用户模板；随机森林在捕捉用户行为模式上优于One-Class SVM。

Abstract: Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics
offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication
setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience.
This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an
Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical
and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data
from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time,
and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two
machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and
Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a
stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate
individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust
intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize
across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of
keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1)
keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication,
and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing
fine-grained user-specific patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究表明，在合成临床试验数据中，超参数优化（HPO）能显著提升数据质量，尤其是组合指标优化表现更优。但HPO需结合领域知识才能生成临床有效的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成临床数据在隐私保护和数据可用性方面的挑战，并改进数据的高保真度和实用性。

Method: 系统地评估了四种HPO策略和八种生成模型，比较了单一指标与组合指标优化的效果。

Result: HPO显著提升了数据质量（最高提升60%），但单独HPO无法保证临床有效性。预处理和后处理是关键，减少约束违规的情况高达61%。

Conclusion: 生成高质量合成数据需整合HPO和领域知识，研究为优化数据生成提供了实用建议。

Abstract: The generation of synthetic clinical trial data offers a promising approach
to mitigating privacy concerns and data accessibility limitations in medical
research. However, ensuring that synthetic datasets maintain high fidelity,
utility, and adherence to domain-specific constraints remains a key challenge.
While hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has been shown to improve generative
model performance, the effectiveness of different optimization strategies for
synthetic clinical data remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates
four HPO strategies across eight generative models, comparing single-metric
optimization against compound metric optimization approaches. Our results
demonstrate that HPO consistently improves synthetic data quality, with TVAE,
CTGAN, and CTAB-GAN+ achieving improvements of up to 60%, 39%, and 38%,
respectively. Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric
strategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets.
Interestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic
data, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints.
Preprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these
violations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in
up to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating
explicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic
datasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic
data generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and
validate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）和循环层的简单有效的时间序列生成模型RVAE-ST，通过渐进增加序列长度的训练方案，解决了长序列建模的挑战，并在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决循环层在建模长序列时面临的挑战，同时保持参数数量不变，并提升长程时间依赖的建模效率。

Method: 采用变分自编码器（VAE）结合循环层，引入渐进增加序列长度的训练方案（RVAE-ST），利用循环架构实现近似时间平移等变性和高效建模。

Result: 模型在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在准周期性时间序列上表现突出，同时在不规则或部分非平稳数据上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过精心组合已知组件，RVAE-ST能够匹配或超越现有生成模型，展示了在时间序列生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present a simple yet effective generative model for time series data based
on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with recurrent layers, referred to as the
Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Subsequent Training (RVAE-ST). Our
method introduces an adapted training scheme that progressively increases the
sequence length, addressing the challenge recurrent layers typically face when
modeling long sequences. By leveraging the recurrent architecture, the model
maintains a constant number of parameters regardless of sequence length. This
design encourages approximate time-shift equivariance and enables efficient
modeling of long-range temporal dependencies. Rather than introducing a
fundamentally new architecture, we show that a carefully composed combination
of known components can match or outperform state-of-the-art generative models
on several benchmark datasets. Our model performs particularly well on time
series that exhibit quasi-periodic structure,while remaining competitive on
datasets with more irregular or partially non-stationary behavior. We evaluate
its performance using ELBO, Fr\'echet Distance, discriminative scores, and
visualizations of the learned embeddings.

Motivation: 现有密度比估计方法在处理分布差异大或支持集重叠不足时表现不佳，存在密度鸿沟与支持鸿沟问题，且边界时间分数不稳定。本文旨在提出一种更稳健、高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出D3RE框架，包括两个核心技术：1) DDBI（去量化扩散桥插值）通过扩散桥和高斯去量化扩展支持集并稳定时间分数；2) DSBI（去量化薛定谔桥插值）结合最优输运解决薛定谔桥问题，提升精度与效率。

Result: 理论证明该方法具有均匀逼近和有界时间分数特性，在互信息和密度估计任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: D3RE框架通过创新设计有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为密度比估计提供了更稳定、高效的解决方案，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Density ratio estimation is fundamental to tasks involving $f$-divergences,
yet existing methods often fail under significantly different distributions or
inadequately overlap supports, suffering from the \textit{density-chasm} and
the \textit{support-chasm} problems. Additionally, prior approaches yield
divergent time scores near boundaries, leading to instability. We propose
$\text{D}^3\text{RE}$, a unified framework for robust and efficient density
ratio estimation. It introduces the Dequantified Diffusion-Bridge Interpolant
(DDBI), which expands support coverage and stabilizes time scores via diffusion
bridges and Gaussian dequantization. Building on DDBI, the Dequantified
Schr\"odinger-Bridge Interpolant (DSBI) incorporates optimal transport to solve
the Schr\"odinger bridge problem, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method
offers uniform approximation and bounded time scores in theory, and outperforms
baselines empirically in mutual information and density estimation tasks.

Conclusion: 神经优化模型为不确定性下的任务调度提供了可扩展且自适应的新方向，尤其适用于现代AI系统的工作流和微服务应用。

Abstract: Project and task scheduling under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge
in program and project management, where accurate estimation of task durations
and dependencies is critical for delivering complex, multi project systems. The
Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to
model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a
novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a
Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and
precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks
inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent
schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy
function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends
the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on
synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the
viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal
constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models
offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling
under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based
applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.

Motivation: 现有基准如HumanEval和MBPP仅评估英文提示下的代码生成能力，忽视了多语言开发者实际使用代码混合语言的情况。

Method: 基于BigCodeBench，引入三种语言对的代码混合提示（Hinglish、西班牙语-英语、拼音-英语），并评估多个开源代码生成模型。

Result: 代码混合提示显著降低了Pass@1性能，尤其是小模型在高代码混合水平下表现更差。

Conclusion: CodeMixBench为多语言代码生成提供了现实评估框架，揭示了构建鲁棒代码生成模型的新挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in code
generation tasks, powering various applications like code completion,
debugging, and programming assistance. However, existing benchmarks such as
HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench primarily evaluate LLMs on English-only
prompts, overlooking the real-world scenario where multilingual developers
often use code-mixed language while interacting with LLMs. To address this gap,
we introduce CodeMixBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the
robustness of LLMs on code generation from code-mixed prompts. Built upon
BigCodeBench, CodeMixBench introduces controlled code-mixing (CMD) into the
natural language parts of prompts across three language pairs: Hinglish
(Hindi-English), Spanish-English, and Chinese Pinyin-English. We
comprehensively evaluate a diverse set of open-source code generation models
ranging from 1.5B to 15B parameters. Our results show that code-mixed prompts
consistently degrade Pass@1 performance compared to their English-only
counterparts, with performance drops increasing under higher CMD levels for
smaller models. CodeMixBench provides a realistic evaluation framework for
studying multilingual code generation and highlights new challenges and
directions for building robust code generation models that generalize well
across diverse linguistic settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning is critical in real-world applications
where it is necessary to efficiently remove the influence of private,
copyrighted, or harmful data from some users. However, existing utility-centric
unlearning metrics (based on model utility) may fail to accurately evaluate the
extent of unlearning in realistic settings such as when (a) the forget and
retain set have semantically similar content, (b) retraining the model from
scratch on the retain set is impractical, and/or (c) the model owner can
improve the unlearning metric without directly performing unlearning on the
LLM. This paper presents the first data-centric unlearning metric for LLMs
called WaterDrum that exploits robust text watermarking for overcoming these
limitations. We also introduce new benchmark datasets for LLM unlearning that
contain varying levels of similar data points and can be used to rigorously
evaluate unlearning algorithms using WaterDrum. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lululu008/WaterDrum and our new benchmark datasets are
released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Glow-AI/WaterDrum-Ax.

Conclusion: ItDPDM通过离散泊松扩散和精确损失设计，显著提升了生成模型的性能，验证了直接离散空间建模的优势。

Abstract: Existing methods for generative modeling of discrete data, such as symbolic
music tokens, face two primary challenges: (1) they either embed discrete
inputs into continuous state-spaces or (2) rely on variational losses that only
approximate the true negative log-likelihood. Previous efforts have
individually targeted these limitations. While information-theoretic Gaussian
diffusion models alleviate the suboptimality of variational losses, they still
perform modeling in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce the
Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), which
simultaneously addresses both limitations by directly operating in a discrete
state-space via a Poisson diffusion process inspired by photon arrival
processes in camera sensors. We introduce a novel Poisson Reconstruction Loss
(PRL) and derive an exact relationship between PRL and the true negative
log-likelihood, thereby eliminating the need for approximate evidence lower
bounds. Experiments conducted on the Lakh MIDI symbolic music dataset and the
CIFAR-10 image benchmark demonstrate that ItDPDM delivers significant
improvements, reducing test NLL by up to 80% compared to prior baselines, while
also achieving faster convergence.

Abstract: The comorbidities of hypertension impose a heavy burden on patients and

remains a challenging task. This study aims to address this challenge by
combining joint graph learning with network analysis. Motivated by this
discovery, we develop a Conjoint Graph Representation Learning (CGRL) framework
that: a) constructs two networks based on disease coding, including the patient
network and the disease difference network. Three comorbidity network features
were generated based on the basic difference network to capture the potential
relationship between comorbidities and risk diseases; b) incorporates
computational structure intervention and learning feature representation, CGRL
was developed to predict the risks of diabetes and coronary heart disease in
patients; and c) analysis the comorbidity patterns and exploring the pathways
of disease progression, the pathological pathogenesis of diabetes and coronary
heart disease may be revealed. The results show that the network features
extracted based on the difference network are important, and the framework we
proposed provides more accurate predictions than other strong models in terms
of accuracy.

Conclusion: AoI调度策略有效提升了联邦学习的可扩展性、公平性和效率，适用于多样化学习环境。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a decentralized framework that preserves data
privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed clients.
However, FL faces significant challenges due to limited communication
resources, statistical heterogeneity, and the need for balanced client
participation. This paper proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-based client
selection policy that addresses these challenges by minimizing load imbalance
through controlled selection intervals. Our method employs a decentralized
Markov scheduling policy, allowing clients to independently manage
participation based on age-dependent selection probabilities, which balances
client updates across training rounds with minimal central oversight. We
provide a convergence proof for our method, demonstrating that it ensures
stable and efficient model convergence. Specifically, we derive optimal
parameters for the Markov selection model to achieve balanced and consistent
client participation, highlighting the benefits of AoI in enhancing convergence
stability. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our AoI-based
method, particularly the optimal Markov variant, improves convergence over the
FedAvg selection approach across both IID and non-IID data settings by $7.5\%$
and up to $20\%$. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of AoI-based
scheduling for scalable, fair, and efficient FL systems across diverse learning
environments.

Conclusion: USPR框架为解决PVRP问题提供了更灵活、高效的方案，推动了未来研究的发展。

Abstract: The Profiled Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP) extends the classical VRP by
incorporating vehicle-client-specific preferences and constraints, reflecting
real-world requirements such as zone restrictions and service-level
preferences. While recent reinforcement learning (RL) solvers have shown
promise, they require retraining for each new profile distribution, suffer from
poor representation ability, and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution
instances. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing USPR
(Unified Solver for Profiled Routing), a novel framework that natively handles
arbitrary profile types. USPR introduces three key innovations: (i) Profile
Embeddings (PE) to encode any combination of profile types; (ii) Multi-Head
Profiled Attention (MHPA), an attention mechanism that models rich interactions
between vehicles and clients; (iii) Profile-aware Score Reshaping (PSR), which
dynamically adjusts decoder logits using profile scores to improve
generalization. Empirical results on diverse PVRP benchmarks demonstrate that
USPR achieves state-of-the-art results among learning-based methods while
offering significant gains in flexibility and computational efficiency. We make
our source code publicly available to foster future research at

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于优势的扩散行动者-评论家（ADAC）方法，通过系统评估分布外动作并利用优势函数调制Q函数更新，提升了离线强化学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习因分布偏移问题导致性能受限，现有方法过于保守，无法有效利用有益分布外动作。ADAC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ADAC通过批最优值函数评估分布外动作，定义优势函数调制Q函数更新，并设计PointMaze环境验证方法。

Result: 实验表明，ADAC在D4RL基准测试中几乎全部任务上达到最佳性能，尤其在更具挑战性的任务上优势显著。

Conclusion: ADAC通过优势调制有效识别和选择优质分布外动作，显著提升离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn decision-making policies
from fixed datasets without online interactions, providing a practical solution
where online data collection is expensive or risky. However, offline RL often
suffers from distribution shift, resulting in inaccurate evaluation and
substantial overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address
this, existing approaches incorporate conservatism by indiscriminately
discouraging all OOD actions, thereby hindering the agent's ability to
generalize and exploit beneficial ones. In this paper, we propose
Advantage-based Diffusion Actor-Critic (ADAC), a novel method that
systematically evaluates OOD actions using the batch-optimal value function.
Based on this evaluation, ADAC defines an advantage function to modulate the
Q-function update, enabling more precise assessment of OOD action quality. We
design a custom PointMaze environment and collect datasets to visually reveal
that advantage modulation can effectively identify and select superior OOD
actions. Extensive experiments show that ADAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on almost all tasks in the D4RL benchmark, with particularly clear
margins on the more challenging tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in machine learning and data mining,
with significant applications in cybersecurity, industrial fault diagnosis, and
clinical disease monitoring. Traditional methods, such as statistical modeling
and machine learning-based approaches, often face challenges in handling
complex, high-dimensional data distributions. In this study, we explore the
potential of diffusion models for anomaly detection, proposing a novel
framework that leverages the strengths of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)
to effectively identify anomalies in both image and audio data. The proposed
method models the distribution of normal data through a diffusion process and
reconstructs input data via reverse diffusion, using a combination of
reconstruction errors and semantic discrepancies as anomaly indicators. To
enhance the framework's performance, we introduce multi-scale feature
extraction, attention mechanisms, and wavelet-domain representations, enabling
the model to capture fine-grained structures and global dependencies in the
data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MVTec AD and
UrbanSound8K, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly
detection techniques, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse
data modalities. This research highlights the effectiveness of diffusion models
in anomaly detection and provides a robust and efficient solution for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LTH掩码在随机初始化时泛化能力不足，这可能是因为优化盆地未对齐。通过排列掩码以对齐不同初始化的盆地，有望提升泛化表现。

Method: 提出一种排列LTH掩码的方法，使其与新随机初始化的优化盆地对齐，并在多数据集和模型上验证其效果。

Result: 实验表明，排列后的LTH掩码显著提高了稀疏训练的泛化性能，适用于CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet等数据集及VGG11、ResNet等模型。

Conclusion: LTH掩码的排列对齐是提升稀疏训练泛化能力的关键，为稀疏训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests there exists a sparse LTH mask
and weights that achieve the same generalization performance as the dense model
while using significantly fewer parameters. However, finding a LTH solution is
computationally expensive, and a LTH sparsity mask does not generalize to other
random weight initializations. Recent work has suggested that neural networks
trained from random initialization find solutions within the same basin modulo
permutation, and proposes a method to align trained models within the same loss
basin. We hypothesize that misalignment of basins is the reason why LTH masks
do not generalize to new random initializations and propose permuting the LTH
mask to align with the new optimization basin when performing sparse training
from a different random init. We empirically show a significant increase in
generalization when sparse training from random initialization with the
permuted mask as compared to using the non-permuted LTH mask, on multiple
datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) and models (VGG11, ResNet20 and
ResNet50).

Motivation: 研究目的是理解少样本学习在Transformer模型中的实现机制，尤其是模型如何从少量示例中提取信号并形成预测规则。

Method: 设计了一个结构化少样本学习任务（加法任务），通过优化方法定位关键注意力头，并分析信号的低维子空间表征。

Conclusion: 通过追踪低维子空间可以解析模型的细粒度计算结构，为理解Transformer的少样本学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from
individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule,
and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the
forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a
structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule
is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high
accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to
just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show
the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the
dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall
magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from
individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which
mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results
demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can
provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.

Motivation: 轨迹数据在交通优化和城市规划中至关重要，但数据噪声和不完整性影响质量。现有TDP方法未解决联邦环境下的隐私问题，且缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FedTDP框架，包括轨迹隐私自编码器、轨迹知识增强器和联邦并行优化，利用大语言模型提升TDP效果。

Result: 在6个真实数据集和10个主流TDP任务上的实验表明，FedTDP优于13个先进基线方法。

Conclusion: FedTDP在隐私保护和模型通用性上表现优异，为联邦环境下的轨迹数据准备提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory data, which capture the movement patterns of people and vehicles
over time and space, are crucial for applications like traffic optimization and
urban planning. However, issues such as noise and incompleteness often
compromise data quality, leading to inaccurate trajectory analyses and limiting
the potential of these applications. While Trajectory Data Preparation (TDP)
can enhance data quality, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (i)
they do not address data privacy concerns, particularly in federated settings
where trajectory data sharing is prohibited, and (ii) they typically design
task-specific models that lack generalizability across diverse TDP scenarios.
To overcome these challenges, we propose FedTDP, a privacy-preserving and
unified framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for TDP in federated environments. Specifically, we: (i) design a
trajectory privacy autoencoder to secure data transmission and protect privacy,
(ii) introduce a trajectory knowledge enhancer to improve model learning of
TDP-related knowledge, enabling the development of TDP-oriented LLMs, and (iii)
propose federated parallel optimization to enhance training efficiency by
reducing data transmission and enabling parallel model training. Experiments on
6 real datasets and 10 mainstream TDP tasks demonstrate that FedTDP
consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 解决在半强盗反馈条件下，最大化最小效用的分配问题，克服了现有方法需要预先知道物品价值的限制，并填补了强盗设定中非加性奖励函数的空白。

Method: 结合强盗技术和资源分配算法，设计了一种算法，在每轮分配物品时仅通过半强盗反馈观察代理估值。

Result: 算法取得了$O(m\sqrt{T}\ln T/n + m\sqrt{T \ln(mnT)})$的遗憾上界，并证明了$\Omega(m\sqrt{T}/n)$的遗憾下界。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在半强盗反馈条件下有效，上界与下界的差距在$T$足够大时为对数因子，验证了方法的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a new decision-making problem called the bandit
max-min fair allocation (BMMFA) problem. The goal of this problem is to
maximize the minimum utility among agents with additive valuations by
repeatedly assigning indivisible goods to them. One key feature of this problem
is that each agent's valuation for each item can only be observed through the
semi-bandit feedback, while existing work supposes that the item values are
provided at the beginning of each round. Another key feature is that the
algorithm's reward function is not additive with respect to rounds, unlike most
bandit-setting problems.
  Our first contribution is to propose an algorithm that has an asymptotic
regret bound of $O(m\sqrt{T}\ln T/n + m\sqrt{T \ln(mnT)})$, where $n$ is the
number of agents, $m$ is the number of items, and $T$ is the time horizon. This
is based on a novel combination of bandit techniques and a resource allocation
algorithm studied in the literature on competitive analysis. Our second
contribution is to provide the regret lower bound of $\Omega(m\sqrt{T}/n)$.
When $T$ is sufficiently larger than $n$, the gap between the upper and lower
bounds is a logarithmic factor of $T$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估指标无法同时满足检测与分类的统一评估需求，且对基域/新域样本比例敏感。为解决这一问题，研究提出了一种更全面的评估标准和方法。

Method: 提出了OpenworldAUC作为统一指标，并设计了Gated Mixture-of-Prompts（GMoP），通过域特定提示和门控机制动态平衡检测与分类。

Result: 在15个开放世界基准测试中，GMoP在OpenworldAUC及其他指标上均实现了最优性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: OpenworldAUC和GMoP为开放世界场景下的模型评估与优化提供了新思路，实验证明了其在任务适应性和性能上的优势。

Abstract: Prompt tuning adapts Vision-Language Models like CLIP to open-world tasks
with minimal training costs. In this direction, one typical paradigm evaluates
model performance separately on known classes (i.e., base domain) and unseen
classes (i.e., new domain). However, real-world scenarios require models to
handle inputs without prior domain knowledge. This practical challenge has
spurred the development of open-world prompt tuning, which demands a unified
evaluation of two stages: 1) detecting whether an input belongs to the base or
new domain (P1), and 2) classifying the sample into its correct class (P2).
What's more, as domain distributions are generally unknown, a proper metric
should be insensitive to varying base/new sample ratios (P3). However, we find
that current metrics, including HM, overall accuracy, and AUROC, fail to
satisfy these three properties simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose
OpenworldAUC, a unified metric that jointly assesses detection and
classification through pairwise instance comparisons. To optimize OpenworldAUC
effectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs
domain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection
and classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under
practical conditions. Experiments on 15 benchmarks in open-world scenarios show
GMoP achieves SOTA performance on OpenworldAUC and other metrics. We release
the code at https://github.com/huacong/OpenworldAUC

TL;DR: SVP（随机变分传播）是一种替代反向传播的扩展方法，通过分层变分推断和局部更新减少内存使用并提升扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播（BP）依赖全局梯度同步，限制了扩展性且内存开销大，因此需要一种更高效且可扩展的训练方法。

Method: SVP将层激活视为隐变量，优化局部证据下界（ELBO），并利用固定随机矩阵投影防止表示坍塌，结合特征对齐损失保证层间一致性。

Result: SVP在多种架构和数据集上达到与BP相当的精度，内存使用减少4倍，扩展性显著提升。

Conclusion: SVP为深度表示学习引入了概率视角，为模块化和可解释的神经网络设计提供了新途径。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on
global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant
memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a
scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational
inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local
Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while
preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in
layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive
compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional
spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and
representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for
inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across
diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to
ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves
scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep
representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable
neural network design.

Result: SIRA在七种最新水印方法上攻击成功率达近100%，成本仅为每百万token 0.88美元。

Conclusion: 当前水印算法存在普遍漏洞，亟需更鲁棒的方案。

Abstract: Text watermarking aims to subtly embed statistical signals into text by
controlling the Large Language Model (LLM)'s sampling process, enabling
watermark detectors to verify that the output was generated by the specified
model. The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor
in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed
watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we
reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing
a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic
efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA),
which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each
token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our
work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking
algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack
success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per
million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark
algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the
attack model, even mobile-level models. Our findings highlight the urgent need
for more robust watermarking.

Abstract: Estimating long-term causal effects by combining long-term observational and
short-term experimental data is a crucial but challenging problem in many
real-world scenarios. In existing methods, several ideal assumptions, e.g.
latent unconfoundedness assumption or additive equi-confounding bias
assumption, are proposed to address the latent confounder problem raised by the
observational data. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are
typically violated which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper,
we tackle the problem of estimating the long-term individual causal effects
without the aforementioned assumptions. Specifically, we propose to utilize the
natural heterogeneity of data, such as data from multiple sources, to identify
latent confounders, thereby significantly avoiding reliance on idealized
assumptions. Practically, we devise a latent representation learning-based
estimator of long-term causal effects. Theoretically, we establish the
identifiability of latent confounders, with which we further achieve long-term
effect identification. Extensive experimental studies, conducted on multiple
synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）在域转移时性能下降且泛化能力差，其假设训练和测试数据分布相同，但在现实中常不成立。论文旨在提升CBMs在跨域场景下的适应性和解释性。

Method: 提出CUDA框架，包含四个关键设计：(1) 通过对抗训练对齐跨域概念表示；(2) 引入松弛阈值允许概念分布的微小差异；(3) 无需目标域标签直接推断概念；(4) 将概念学习与理论保证的域适应结合。

Conclusion: CUDA有效解决了概念瓶颈模型在域适应中的局限性，提升了模型的鲁棒性和解释性，为域适应领域设立了新基准。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by explaining
predictions through human-understandable concepts but typically assume that
training and test data share the same distribution. This assumption often fails
under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization.
To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the
Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed
to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial
training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific
differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due
to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the
target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to
diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain
adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and
establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world
datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the radio resource allocation problem in a wireless
system with various integrated functionalities, such as communication, sensing
and computing. We design suitable resource management techniques that can
simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale
appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We
propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns
are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to
iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a
generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such
models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their
training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such,
GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that
update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide
simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources
achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than
half of the number of acquisition rounds.

challenging resource allocation problem in the field of AutoML. We propose
MaxUCB, a max $k$-armed bandit method to trade off exploring different model
classes and conducting hyperparameter optimization. MaxUCB is specifically
designed for the light-tailed and bounded reward distributions arising in this
setting and, thus, provides an efficient alternative compared to classic max
$k$-armed bandit methods assuming heavy-tailed reward distributions. We
theoretically and empirically evaluate our method on four standard AutoML
benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over prior approaches.

<details>

Result: 在多个少样本表格学习基准测试中，Latte表现出优越性能，成为该领域的先进方法。

Conclusion: Latte通过训练时知识提取和广义知识引导，显著提升了少样本表格学习的性能，并有效减少了过拟合风险。

Abstract: Few-shot tabular learning, in which machine learning models are trained with
a limited amount of labeled data, provides a cost-effective approach to
addressing real-world challenges. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in leveraging their pre-trained knowledge for few-shot
tabular learning. Despite promising results, existing approaches either rely on
test-time knowledge extraction, which introduces undesirable latency, or
text-level knowledge, which leads to unreliable feature engineering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Latte, a training-time knowledge
extraction framework that transfers the latent prior knowledge within LLMs to
optimize a more generalized downstream model. Latte enables general
knowledge-guided downstream tabular learning, facilitating the weighted fusion
of information across different feature values while reducing the risk of
overfitting to limited labeled data. Furthermore, Latte is compatible with
existing unsupervised pre-training paradigms and effectively utilizes available
unlabeled samples to overcome the performance limitations imposed by an
extremely small labeled dataset. Extensive experiments on various few-shot
tabular learning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of Latte,
establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach in this domain

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于主动学习的数据高效处理效应估计方法FCCM，通过优化事实和反事实覆盖半径，减少风险上界，在有限标注预算下实现更高质量的数据采集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于治疗效应标注成本高昂（如肿瘤影像或活检），现有算法在标注数据不足时效果受限。如何在有限标注预算下高效获取高质量标注数据成为关键问题。

Method: 1. 通过理论分析定义了事实和反事实覆盖半径以确定风险上界；2. 提出贪心半径缩减算法（理想平衡数据分布）；3. 进一步提出FCCM方法，将目标转化为事实和反事实覆盖最大化，适应现实数据分布。

Result: 在完全合成和半合成数据集上的实验表明，FCCM优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: FCCM通过主动学习框架有效降低了处理效应估计的风险上界，为高成本标注场景提供了数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although numerous complex algorithms for treatment effect estimation have
been developed in recent years, their effectiveness remains limited when
handling insufficiently labeled training sets due to the high cost of labeling
the effect after treatment, e.g., expensive tumor imaging or biopsy procedures
needed to evaluate treatment effects. Therefore, it becomes essential to
actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a
constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect
estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis
within the active learning context, where the derived key measures --
\textit{factual} and \textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk
upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction
algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To
generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which
transforms the optimization objective into the \textit{Factual} and
\textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius
reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other
baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式部分可观测且无通信能力的多智能体环境中，MARL面临协作难题，尤其需要从个体观测中推断状态表示并优化协作策略。

Conclusion: 通过状态建模和对抗式探索，SMPE算法有效提升了多智能体在部分可观测环境中的协作性能。

Abstract: Learning to cooperate in distributed partially observable environments with
no communication abilities poses significant challenges for multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper addresses key concerns in this
domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent
observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents'
exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose
a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer
meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to
optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative
joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE
algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities
under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the
policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration
policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while
improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that
SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative
tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.

TL;DR: MTL-UE是首个针对多任务数据和模型生成不可学习样本的统一框架，通过生成器结构和双重嵌入正则化显著提升攻击性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不可学习策略主要针对单任务学习，而多任务学习和通用模型的重要性日益凸显，但相关研究却被忽视。

Method: 设计了基于生成器的结构，引入标签先验和类特征嵌入，并结合任务内外嵌入正则化。

Result: 在4个多任务数据集、3种基础UE方法、5种模型架构和5种任务权重策略上表现出色。

Conclusion: MTL-UE为多任务场景提供高效、通用的不可学习样本生成方案，攻击性能优越且适应性强。

Abstract: Most existing unlearnable strategies focus on preventing unauthorized users
from training single-task learning (STL) models with personal data.
Nevertheless, the paradigm has recently shifted towards multi-task data and
multi-task learning (MTL), targeting generalist and foundation models that can
handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Despite their growing importance, MTL
data and models have been largely neglected while pursuing unlearnable
strategies. This paper presents MTL-UE, the first unified framework for
generating unlearnable examples for multi-task data and MTL models. Instead of
optimizing perturbations for each sample, we design a generator-based structure
that introduces label priors and class-wise feature embeddings which leads to
much better attacking performance. In addition, MTL-UE incorporates intra-task
and inter-task embedding regularization to increase inter-class separation and
suppress intra-class variance which enhances the attack robustness greatly.
Furthermore, MTL-UE is versatile with good supports for dense prediction tasks
in MTL. It is also plug-and-play allowing integrating existing
surrogate-dependent unlearnable methods with little adaptation. Extensive
experiments show that MTL-UE achieves superior attacking performance
consistently across 4 MTL datasets, 3 base UE methods, 5 model backbones, and 5
MTL task-weighting strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型性能监控依赖真实标签，但实际中标签往往不可用，导致监控延迟或无法进行，亟需一种能估算多种分类指标的无标签方法。

Method: CBPE通过将混淆矩阵元素视为随机变量，利用校准后的模型置信度分数估计其分布，进而推导目标指标的概率分布。

Result: 该方法能准确估算准确率、精确率、召回率和F1值，并提供理论保证和有效置信区间。

Conclusion: CBPE为无标签条件下的模型监控提供了通用且可靠的解决方案，扩展了性能评估的适用场景。

Abstract: Model monitoring is a critical component of the machine learning lifecycle,
safeguarding against undetected drops in the model's performance after
deployment. Traditionally, performance monitoring has required access to ground
truth labels, which are not always readily available. This can result in
unacceptable latency or render performance monitoring altogether impossible.
Recently, methods designed to estimate the accuracy of classifier models
without access to labels have shown promising results. However, there are
various other metrics that might be more suitable for assessing model
performance in many cases. Until now, none of these important metrics has
received similar interest from the scientific community. In this work, we
address this gap by presenting CBPE, a novel method that can estimate any
binary classification metric defined using the confusion matrix. In particular,
we choose four metrics from this large family: accuracy, precision, recall, and
F$_1$, to demonstrate our method. CBPE treats the elements of the confusion
matrix as random variables and leverages calibrated confidence scores of the
model to estimate their distributions. The desired metric is then also treated
as a random variable, whose full probability distribution can be derived from
the estimated confusion matrix. CBPE is shown to produce estimates that come
with strong theoretical guarantees and valid confidence intervals.

TL;DR: 提出了Elastic Reasoning框架，将推理分为‘思考’和‘解决’两个阶段并独立分配预算，提升了资源受限时的可靠性，同时在未受限场景下生成更简洁高效的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）虽然在复杂任务上表现出色，但其无法控制的输出长度在实际部署中面临资源严格受限的挑战，因此需要一种可扩展且可控的推理方法。

Method: 提出了Elastic Reasoning框架，明确将推理分为‘思考’和‘解决’两个阶段，并通过预算约束的rollout策略训练模型适应截断思考，无需额外训练即可泛化到未见过的预算限制。

Result: 在数学（AIME, MATH500）和编程（LiveCodeBench, Codeforces）基准测试中，Elastic Reasoning在严格预算限制下表现稳健，同时训练成本显著低于基线方法，且在未受限场景下也能生成更简洁的推理。

Conclusion: Elastic Reasoning为大规模可控推理提供了原则性和实用的解决方案，解决了资源受限环境下的挑战。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress on complex
tasks by generating extended chains of thought (CoT). However, their
uncontrolled output lengths pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment, where inference-time budgets on tokens, latency, or compute are
strictly constrained. We propose Elastic Reasoning, a novel framework for
scalable chain of thoughts that explicitly separates reasoning into two
phases--thinking and solution--with independently allocated budgets. At test
time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments,
significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train
models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight
budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the
model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and
generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional
training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming
(LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning
performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring
significantly lower training cost than baseline methods. Remarkably, our
approach also produces more concise and efficient reasoning even in
unconstrained settings. Elastic Reasoning offers a principled and practical
solution to the pressing challenge of controllable reasoning at scale.

Motivation: 研究LLP这一部分信息设置下的学习问题，旨在在仅有分组标签聚合值的情况下，实现个体样本级别的低遗憾，并优化样本复杂度。

Method: 采用结合经验风险最小化（ERM）和随机梯度下降（SGD）的算法，并辅以特定的方差减少技术。

Result: 理论分析显示样本复杂度在包大小依赖性上有显著改进，实验验证了该算法在多个数据集上的优越性（更少样本、更高准确率）。

Conclusion: 该研究在LLP领域提供了理论改进和有效算法，实验证明了其优于现有方法的样本效率和准确性。

Abstract: We investigate Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a partial information
setting where examples in a training set are grouped into bags, and only
aggregate label values in each bag are available. Despite the partial
observability, the goal is still to achieve small regret at the level of
individual examples. We give results on the sample complexity of LLP under
square loss, showing that our sample complexity is essentially optimal. From an
algorithmic viewpoint, we rely on carefully designed variants of Empirical Risk
Minimization, and Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, combined with ad hoc
variance reduction techniques. On one hand, our theoretical results improve in
important ways on the existing literature on LLP, specifically in the way the
sample complexity depends on the bag size. On the other hand, we validate our
algorithmic solutions on several datasets, demonstrating improved empirical
performance (better accuracy for less samples) against recent baselines.

Conclusion: DIFF-FLOOD为沿海洪水预测提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，有助于减轻洪水风险。

Abstract: Coastal flooding poses significant risks to communities, necessitating fast
and accurate forecasting methods to mitigate potential damage. To approach this
problem, we present DIFF-FLOOD, a probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting
method designed based on denoising diffusion models. DIFF-FLOOD predicts
inundation level at a location by taking both spatial and temporal context into
account. It utilizes inundation levels at neighboring locations and digital
elevation data as spatial context. Inundation history from a context time
window, together with additional co-variates are used as temporal context.
Convolutional neural networks and cross-attention mechanism are then employed
to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics in the data. We trained and tested
DIFF-FLOOD on coastal inundation data from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, a
region highly impacted by coastal flooding. Our results show that, DIFF-FLOOD
outperforms existing forecasting methods in terms of prediction performance (6%
to 64% improvement in terms of two performance metrics) and scalability.

We introduce a novel algorithm, Classification and Regression Tree - Exhaustive

investigate the algorithm's computational complexity and its predictive
capabilities. Our results demonstrate that CART-ELC consistently achieves

TL;DR: 该论文重新定义了Transformer模型的锐度概念，提出了一种考虑其对称性的新方法，通过在商流形上定义锐度，成功恢复了锐度与泛化能力之间的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锐度度量方法对Transformer模型效果不佳，因为其注意力机制具有丰富的对称性，导致参数空间中某些方向的损失不变。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用黎曼几何工具，在商流形上定义新的锐度，消除Transformer对称性的影响，并通过近似测地线计算高效实现。

Result: 在合成数据和真实文本/图像分类任务中，新定义的测地线锐度与泛化能力表现出强相关性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑对称性，论文提出的锐度度量方法显著提升了Transformer模型泛化能力的预测准确性。

Abstract: The concept of sharpness has been successfully applied to traditional
architectures like MLPs and CNNs to predict their generalization. For
transformers, however, recent work reported weak correlation between flatness
and generalization. We argue that existing sharpness measures fail for
transformers, because they have much richer symmetries in their attention
mechanism that induce directions in parameter space along which the network or
its loss remain identical. We posit that sharpness must account fully for these
symmetries, and thus we redefine it on a quotient manifold that results from
quotienting out the transformer symmetries, thereby removing their ambiguities.
Leveraging tools from Riemannian geometry, we propose a fully general notion of
sharpness, in terms of a geodesic ball on the symmetry-corrected quotient
manifold. In practice, we need to resort to approximating the geodesics. Doing
so up to first order yields existing adaptive sharpness measures, and we
demonstrate that including higher-order terms is crucial to recover correlation
with generalization. We present results on diagonal networks with synthetic
data, and show that our geodesic sharpness reveals strong correlation for
real-world transformers on both text and image classification tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DPQ-HD的后训练压缩算法，通过分解、剪枝和量化技术组合压缩超维计算（HDC）系统，实现接近浮点性能且无需重新训练，显著降低了计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HDC应用依赖高精度模型或编码矩阵，计算和内存需求高，难以适用于超低功耗设备。现有压缩方法通常需要重新训练，成本高且不实用。

Method: 提出了Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD)算法，通过分解、剪枝和量化技术压缩HDC系统，并结合渐进式相似度评分和提前退出策略加速推理。

Result: DPQ-HD在图像和图形分类任务上实现了20-100倍内存减少，精度仅下降1-2%，且在优化时间和推理速度上显著优于现有方法（优化时间快100倍，推理快56倍）。

Conclusion: DPQ-HD是一种高效的HDC压缩方法，为边缘AI设备提供了高性能和低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is emerging as a promising approach for edge
AI, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, current
HDC-based applications often rely on high-precision models and/or encoding
matrices to achieve competitive performance, which imposes significant
computational and memory demands, especially for ultra-low power devices. While
recent efforts use techniques like precision reduction and pruning to increase
the efficiency, most require retraining to maintain performance, making them
expensive and impractical. To address this issue, we propose a novel Post
Training Compression algorithm, Decomposition-Pruning-Quantization (DPQ-HD),
which aims at compressing the end-to-end HDC system, achieving near floating
point performance without the need of retraining. DPQ-HD reduces computational
and memory overhead by uniquely combining the above three compression
techniques and efficiently adapts to hardware constraints. Additionally, we
introduce an energy-efficient inference approach that progressively evaluates
similarity scores such as cosine similarity and performs early exit to reduce
the computation, accelerating prediction inference while maintaining accuracy.
We demonstrate that DPQ-HD achieves up to 20-100x reduction in memory for image
and graph classification tasks with only a 1-2% drop in accuracy compared to
uncompressed workloads. Lastly, we show that DPQ-HD outperforms the existing
post-training compression methods and performs better or at par with
retraining-based state-of-the-art techniques, requiring significantly less
overall optimization time (up to 100x) and faster inference (up to 56x) on a
microcontroller

Motivation: 传统监督学习方法在数据同化中效率有限，强化学习（RL）因其迭代决策框架能更动态地平衡模型预测与观测，适合数据同化的需求。

Method: RL-DAUNCE结合物理约束，通过三个关键创新：1) 代理设计类同传统同化的集合成员；2) 强调不确定性量化；3) 采用原始-对偶优化策略约束动作空间以保障物理一致性。

Result: 在Madden-Julian Oscillation案例中，RL-DAUNCE表现优于标准EnKF，尤其在恢复间歇信号、捕获极端事件和量化不确定性方面，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: RL-DAUNCE通过物理约束和高效强化学习框架，显著提升了非高斯现象的数据同化性能，兼具计算效率与精度。

Abstract: Machine learning has become a powerful tool for enhancing data assimilation.
While supervised learning remains the standard method, reinforcement learning
(RL) offers unique advantages through its sequential decision-making framework,
which naturally fits the iterative nature of data assimilation by dynamically
balancing model forecasts with observations. We develop RL-DAUNCE, a new
RL-based method that enhances data assimilation with physical constraints
through three key aspects. First, RL-DAUNCE inherits the computational
efficiency of machine learning while it uniquely structures its agents to
mirror ensemble members in conventional data assimilation methods. Second,
RL-DAUNCE emphasizes uncertainty quantification by advancing multiple ensemble
members, moving beyond simple mean-state optimization. Third, RL-DAUNCE's
ensemble-as-agents design facilitates the enforcement of physical constraints
during the assimilation process, which is crucial to improving the state
estimation and subsequent forecasting. A primal-dual optimization strategy is
developed to enforce constraints, which dynamically penalizes the reward
function to ensure constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process.
Also, state variable bounds are respected by constraining the RL action space.
Together, these features ensure physical consistency without sacrificing
efficiency. RL-DAUNCE is applied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, an
intermittent atmospheric phenomenon characterized by strongly non-Gaussian
features and multiple physical constraints. RL-DAUNCE outperforms the standard
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which fails catastrophically due to the
violation of physical constraints. Notably, RL-DAUNCE matches the performance
of constrained EnKF, particularly in recovering intermittent signals, capturing
extreme events, and quantifying uncertainties, while requiring substantially
less computational effort.

Abstract: This article explores the emergence of autonomy and agency by connecting
fundamental computational limits (decidability, completeness, computational
irreducibility) with physical concepts. We introduce a formal model of a
"minimal agent" operating within potentially Turing-complete environments.
Using algorithmic information theory, we argue that the inherent undecidability
and computational irreducibility of agent-environment interaction lead to
unpredictability and novel information generation, enabling agency (effective
goal-directed action). Computational irreducibility prevents full external
prediction, creating necessary conditions for autonomous behavior. We relate
this to computational sourcehood, where an agent is the irreducible origin of
its behavior, though formalizing this concept remains challenging. Our central
thesis, formally proven, is that genuine autonomy necessarily implies
undecidability from an external perspective, distinguishing autonomous systems
from predictable ones. We propose that agency arises when agent-environment
coupling complexity allows mutual information between internal states and
relevant environmental variables to increase, particularly where analytical
solutions are absent and operational closure is needed for persistence. This
framework links agency directly to the computational properties of interaction,
offering implications for understanding consciousness, designing autonomous AI,
and reconceptualizing free will in a deterministic yet computationally
irreducible universe.

*Enqiang Zhu,Chenkai Hao,Chanjuan Liu,Yongsheng Rao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DynLS的高效算法，用于解决最大加权独立集（MWIS）问题，该算法通过评分自适应顶点扰动、区域定位机制和可变邻域下降策略，显著提升了求解效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI方法在智能交通系统（ITS）中需要大量训练时间和计算资源，而MWIS问题由于其NP难特性，亟需高效解法以支持实际应用。

Method: DynLS算法结合了评分自适应顶点扰动（SAVP）加速收敛、区域定位机制（RLM）跳出局部最优，以及混合邻域下降策略（ComLS）引导搜索方向。

Result: 在360个测试实例中，DynLS在350例中表现最佳，比第二优算法Cyclic-Fast多解决177例，且在收敛速度上与之相当。

Conclusion: DynLS为MWIS问题提供了高效的启发式算法，可辅助AI优化智能交通系统，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: While Artificial intelligence (AI), including Generative AI, are effective at
generating high-quality traffic data and optimization solutions in intelligent
transportation systems (ITSs), these techniques often demand significant
training time and computational resources, especially in large-scale and
complex scenarios. To address this, we introduce a novel and efficient
algorithm for solving the maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem,
which can be used to model many ITSs applications, such as traffic signal
control and vehicle routing. Given the NP-hard nature of the MWIS problem, our
proposed algorithm, DynLS, incorporates three key innovations to solve it
effectively. First, it uses a scores-based adaptive vertex perturbation (SAVP)
technique to accelerate convergence, particularly in sparse graphs. Second, it
includes a region location mechanism (RLM) to help escape local optima by
dynamically adjusting the search space. Finally, it employs a novel variable
neighborhood descent strategy, ComLS, which combines vertex exchange strategies
with a reward mechanism to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Our
experimental results demonstrate DynLS's superior performance, consistently
delivering high-quality solutions within 1000 seconds. DynLS outperformed five
leading algorithms across 360 test instances, achieving the best solution for
350 instances and surpassing the second-best algorithm, Cyclic-Fast, by 177
instances. Moreover, DynLS matched Cyclic-Fast's convergence speed,
highlighting its efficiency and practicality. This research represents a
significant advancement in heuristic algorithms for the MWIS problem, offering
a promising approach to aid AI techniques in optimizing intelligent
transportation systems.

*Sutapa Dey Tithi,Arun Kumar Ramesh,Clara DiMarco,Xiaoyi Tian,Nazia Alam,Kimia Fazeli,Tiffany Barnes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 智能辅导系统在命题逻辑证明教学中表现有效，但基于模板的反馈限制了其个性化能力。研究评估了四种先进大语言模型（LLMs）在358道命题逻辑问题中的逐步证明准确性，发现DeepSeek-V3以84.4%的准确率表现最佳。进一步使用最佳模型为1,050个学生问题状态生成提示，结果显示提示准确率为75%，但在解释背景方面表现欠佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型能否为智能辅导系统提供动态、个性化的逻辑证明反馈，同时克服其可能产生的幻觉或教学不当问题。

Method: 比较六种提示技术下四种LLMs在命题逻辑问题中的逐步证明准确性，并利用最佳模型生成提示，通过LLM和人类专家评估其质量。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在逐步证明中表现最优（84.4%准确率），生成的提示75%准确且被人类评价为清晰一致，但在解释背景方面不足。

Conclusion: LLMs可增强智能辅导系统的逻辑提示功能，但需进一步改进以确保准确性和教学适用性。

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have demonstrated effectiveness in teaching
formal propositional logic proofs, but their reliance on template-based
explanations limits their ability to provide personalized student feedback.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for dynamic
feedback generation, they risk producing hallucinations or pedagogically
unsound explanations. We evaluated the stepwise accuracy of LLMs in
constructing multi-step symbolic logic proofs, comparing six prompting
techniques across four state-of-the-art LLMs on 358 propositional logic
problems. Results show that DeepSeek-V3 achieved superior performance with
84.4% accuracy on stepwise proof construction and excelled particularly in
simpler rules. We further used the best-performing LLM to generate explanatory
hints for 1,050 unique student problem-solving states from a logic ITS and
evaluated them on 4 criteria with both an LLM grader and human expert ratings
on a 20% sample. Our analysis finds that LLM-generated hints were 75% accurate
and rated highly by human evaluators on consistency and clarity, but did not
perform as well explaining why the hint was provided or its larger context. Our
results demonstrate that LLMs may be used to augment tutoring systems with
logic tutoring hints, but requires additional modifications to ensure accuracy
and pedagogical appropriateness.

Method: 通过分析标准RL框架的假设和政策梯度与基于价值的模型的差异来论证。

Result: 指出政策梯度和基于价值的方法都需要价值的表示，且争议应更多关注建模假设而非优化算法。

Conclusion: 建议在认知科学中采用更细致的模型评估，考虑计算复杂度等多方面因素，同时重新审视价值的定义。

Abstract: Action-values play a central role in popular Reinforcement Learing (RL)
models of behavior. Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented
has been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that
policy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a
potential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is
unsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, "Value-free" --
while they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting
(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching
to PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of
behavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems
from the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by
the standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve
it. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as
part of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the
different methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,
instead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the
underlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from
an experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be
reconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,
full-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are
relaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as
a case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than
statistical, view of what constitutes "a model" in cognitive sciences. Our
analysis suggests that besides "parametric" statistical complexity, additional
aspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when
evaluating model complexity.

Motivation: 快速有效的网络防御至关重要，但现有ACD方法依赖高成本的RL训练，且缺乏可解释性和可迁移性。LLM能提供可解释性，但多智能体场景下尚未被充分研究。

Method: 研究通过在CybORG CAGE 4环境中集成LLM，提出新的通信协议，评估LLM与RL智能体在多智能体ACD任务中的交互表现。

Result: 研究揭示了LLM与RL智能体在多智能体环境中的优势和不足，为未来ACD团队的研发提供了方向。

Conclusion: LLM在多智能体ACD场景中展现出潜力，但需进一步研究优化训练和部署策略。

Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial
cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response
through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most
ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and
their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language
Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in
general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but
have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD
agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in
multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE
4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by
proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths
and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research
directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.

Motivation: 现有的大规模训练数据集多基于欧美流行文化，导致模型在个体文化领域生成效果不佳，甚至可能产生刻板印象或冒犯性内容。

Method: 作者提出了一种收集和处理文化代码数据的方法，并基于俄罗斯文化构建数据集，利用Kandinsky 3.1模型评估其对生成质量的影响。

Result: 人类评估显示，该方法显著提升了模型对俄罗斯文化的理解和生成质量。

Conclusion: 通过文化代码数据集的引入，可以有效改善文本生成图像模型在个体文化领域的表现。

Abstract: Despite the fact that popular text-to-image generation models cope well with
international and general cultural queries, they have a significant knowledge
gap regarding individual cultures. This is due to the content of existing large
training datasets collected on the Internet, which are predominantly based on
Western European or American popular culture. Meanwhile, the lack of cultural
adaptation of the model can lead to incorrect results, a decrease in the
generation quality, and the spread of stereotypes and offensive content. In an
effort to address this issue, we examine the concept of cultural code and
recognize the critical importance of its understanding by modern image
generation models, an issue that has not been sufficiently addressed in the
research community to date. We propose the methodology for collecting and
processing the data necessary to form a dataset based on the cultural code, in
particular the Russian one. We explore how the collected data affects the
quality of generations in the national domain and analyze the effectiveness of
our approach using the Kandinsky 3.1 text-to-image model. Human evaluation
results demonstrate an increase in the level of awareness of Russian culture in
the model.

Abstract: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based
generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as
general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their
utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the
reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning
process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this
approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the
architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent
variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning
tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present
enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in
training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and
future AI architectures.

Abstract: We examine belief filtering as a mechanism for the epistemic control of
artificial agents, focusing on the regulation of internal cognitive states
represented as linguistic expressions. This mechanism is developed within the
Semantic Manifold framework, where belief states are dynamic, structured
ensembles of natural language fragments. Belief filters act as content-aware
operations on these fragments across various cognitive transitions. This paper
illustrates how the inherent interpretability and modularity of such a
linguistically-grounded cognitive architecture directly enable belief
filtering, offering a principled approach to agent regulation. The study
highlights the potential for enhancing AI safety and alignment through
structured interventions in an agent's internal semantic space and points to
new directions for architecturally embedded cognitive governance.

Abstract: Despite the impressive achievements of AI, including advancements in
generative models and large language models, there remains a significant gap in
the ability of AI to handle uncertainty and generalize beyond the training
data. We argue that AI models, especially in autonomous systems, fail to make
robust predictions when faced with unfamiliar or adversarial data, as evidenced
by incidents with autonomous vehicles. Traditional machine learning approaches
struggle to address these issues due to an overemphasis on data fitting and
domain adaptation. This position paper posits a paradigm shift towards
epistemic artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need for models to learn not
only from what they know but also from their ignorance. This approach, which
focuses on recognizing and managing uncertainty, offers a potential solution to
improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems, ensuring that they can
better handle unpredictable real-world environments.

Conclusion: 呼吁社区关注并实施改革，以完善同行评审制度。

Abstract: The peer review process in major artificial intelligence (AI) conferences
faces unprecedented challenges with the surge of paper submissions (exceeding
10,000 submissions per venue), accompanied by growing concerns over review
quality and reviewer responsibility. This position paper argues for the need to
transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback
loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal
accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a
sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be
viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and
system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share
responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only
be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical
concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper
focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through
two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows
authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a
systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask
for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are
needed to enhance the peer review process.

Abstract: The tragedy of the commons, where individual self-interest leads to
collectively disastrous outcomes, is a pervasive challenge in human society.
Recent studies have demonstrated that similar phenomena can arise in generative
multi-agent systems (MASs). To address this challenge, this paper explores the
use of reputation systems as a remedy. We propose RepuNet, a dynamic,
dual-level reputation framework that models both agent-level reputation
dynamics and system-level network evolution. Specifically, driven by direct
interactions and indirect gossip, agents form reputations for both themselves
and their peers, and decide whether to connect or disconnect other agents for
future interactions. Through two distinct scenarios, we show that RepuNet
effectively mitigates the 'tragedy of the commons', promoting and sustaining
cooperation in generative MASs. Moreover, we find that reputation systems can
give rise to rich emergent behaviors in generative MASs, such as the formation
of cooperative clusters, the social isolation of exploitative agents, and the
preference for sharing positive gossip rather than negative ones.

Conclusion: 混合RL-BS方法在实现高效布局的同时保持了RL的泛化能力，为自动化模拟IC设计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing
device physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with
learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL)
has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the
floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL
with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference
process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating
various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the
need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's
generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of
circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85%
improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a
standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover,
performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing
state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: One of the goals of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence is to exploit

most of the existing frameworks focus on the simplified scenario where
knowledge does not change over time and does not cover the temporal dimension.
In this work we consider the much more challenging problem of knowledge-driven
sequence classification where different portions of knowledge must be employed
at different timesteps, and temporal relations are available. Our experimental
evaluation compares multi-stage neuro-symbolic and neural-only architectures,
and it is conducted on a newly-introduced benchmarking framework. Results
demonstrate the challenging nature of this novel setting, and also highlight
under-explored shortcomings of neuro-symbolic methods, representing a precious

Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (Embodied AI) plays a pivotal role in the
application of advanced technologies in the intelligent era, where AI systems
are integrated with physical bodies that enable them to perceive, reason, and
interact with their environments. Through the use of sensors for input and
actuators for action, these systems can learn and adapt based on real-world
feedback, allowing them to perform tasks effectively in dynamic and
unpredictable environments. As techniques such as deep learning (DL),
reinforcement learning (RL), and large language models (LLMs) mature, embodied
AI has become a leading field in both academia and industry, with applications
spanning robotics, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. However, most
research has focused on single-agent systems that often assume static, closed
environments, whereas real-world embodied AI must navigate far more complex
scenarios. In such settings, agents must not only interact with their
surroundings but also collaborate with other agents, necessitating
sophisticated mechanisms for adaptation, real-time learning, and collaborative
problem-solving. Despite increasing interest in multi-agent systems, existing
research remains narrow in scope, often relying on simplified models that fail
to capture the full complexity of dynamic, open environments for multi-agent
embodied AI. Moreover, no comprehensive survey has systematically reviewed the
advancements in this area. As embodied AI rapidly evolves, it is crucial to
deepen our understanding of multi-agent embodied AI to address the challenges
presented by real-world applications. To fill this gap and foster further
development in the field, this paper reviews the current state of research,
analyzes key contributions, and identifies challenges and future directions,
providing insights to guide innovation and progress in this field.

Result: 模型能够很好地拟合数据，表明AI代理在长时间任务中的失败率随时间指数增长。

Conclusion: 该模型揭示了AI在长时间任务中表现下降的潜在原因，但其普适性需进一步验证。

Abstract: Building on the recent empirical work of Kwa et al. (2025), I show that
within their suite of research-engineering tasks the performance of AI agents
on longer-duration tasks can be explained by an extremely simple mathematical
model -- a constant rate of failing during each minute a human would take to do
the task. This implies an exponentially declining success rate with the length
of the task and that each agent could be characterised by its own half-life.
This empirical regularity allows us to estimate the success rate for an agent
at different task lengths. And the fact that this model is a good fit for the
data is suggestive of the underlying causes of failure on longer tasks -- that
they involve increasingly large sets of subtasks where failing any one fails
the task. Whether this model applies more generally on other suites of tasks is
unknown and an important subject for further work.

### [128] [MARK: Memory Augmented Refinement of Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05177)
*Anish Ganguli,Prabal Deb,Debleena Banerjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了MARK框架，通过结构化精炼记忆让LLM无需重新训练即可持续学习，解决了领域知识与LLM间的差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在适应不断演变的领域知识时需昂贵微调，且领域专家与系统知识间的差距影响了信息检索和应用的准确性。

Method: 采用MARK框架，包含三个专门代理：存储领域洞察的残余记忆代理、捕捉用户信息的用户问题记忆代理、提炼LLM回应的响应记忆代理。

Result: MARK减少了LLM幻觉，支持领域特定适配（如医疗、法律），并提升个性化AI助手的连贯性。

Conclusion: MARK通过结构化精炼记忆实现了LLM的持续学习与领域适应，提升了信息准确性和个性化体验。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to
align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain
knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid')
and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory:
Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a
significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced
understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate
information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of
Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without
retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of
Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role:
Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to
maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures
user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension;
LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for
refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory,
detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy.
Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information
while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground
Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference;
Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and
manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets;
Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user
preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个替代传统“统一对齐”的方法，称为“适当性框架”，以应对AI决策中的道德多样性，强调设计原则以适应持续的分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的AI系统在决策时忽略道德多样性，可能导致信任危机和制度不稳定，亟需一种新方法处理这种多样性。

Method: 提出“适当性框架”，基于冲突理论、文化进化、多智能体系统和制度经济学，包含四个设计原则：情境基础、社区定制、持续适应和多中心治理。

Result: 框架将AI对齐的隐喻从道德统一转向冲突管理，更具实用性和紧迫性。

Conclusion: 采用适当性框架是一种更有效的方法，能够适应持续的道德分歧，对AI系统的安全与伦理操作至关重要。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly placed in positions
where their decisions have real consequences, e.g., moderating online spaces,
conducting research, and advising on policy. Ensuring they operate in a safe
and ethically acceptable fashion is thus critical. However, most solutions have
been a form of one-size-fits-all "alignment". We are worried that such systems,
which overlook enduring moral diversity, will spark resistance, erode trust,
and destabilize our institutions. This paper traces the underlying problem to
an often-unstated Axiom of Rational Convergence: the idea that under ideal
conditions, rational agents will converge in the limit of conversation on a
single ethics. Treating that premise as both optional and doubtful, we propose
what we call the appropriateness framework: an alternative approach grounded in
conflict theory, cultural evolution, multi-agent systems, and institutional
economics. The appropriateness framework treats persistent disagreement as the
normal case and designs for it by applying four principles: (1) contextual
grounding, (2) community customization, (3) continual adaptation, and (4)
polycentric governance. We argue here that adopting these design principles is
a good way to shift the main alignment metaphor from moral unification to a
more productive metaphor of conflict management, and that taking this step is
both desirable and urgent.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of chemistry literature poses significant challenges for
researchers seeking to efficiently access domain-specific knowledge. To support
advancements in chemistry-focused natural language processing (NLP), we present
ChemRxivQuest, a curated dataset of 970 high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs

and a fuzzy matching technique for answer verification. The dataset emphasizes
conceptual, mechanistic, applied, and experimental questions, enabling
applications in retrieval-based QA systems, search engine development, and
fine-tuning of domain-adapted large language models. We analyze the dataset's
structure, coverage, and limitations, and outline future directions for
expansion and expert validation. ChemRxivQuest provides a foundational resource
for chemistry NLP research, education, and tool development.

### [131] [Advancing Neural Network Verification through Hierarchical Safety Abstract Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05235)
*Luca Marzari,Isabella Mastroeni,Alessandro Farinelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为Abstract DNN-Verification的新方法，通过层次化不安全输出的验证，为深度神经网络（DNN）提供更细粒度的安全性分析，相比传统二元验证方法更高效且能评估多种安全级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度神经网络（DNN）形式化验证方法仅以二元方式（安全/不安全）评估模型安全性，无法捕捉模型内部的细微安全差异，导致验证结果过于严格或宽松。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 引入Abstract DNN-Verification方法，利用抽象解释和输出可达集分析，验证不安全输出的层次结构，从而实现对DNN的多级安全性评估。该方法保留了与传统方法相同或更低的最坏情况计算复杂度。

Result: 方法能够按抽象安全级别对对抗性输入进行排序，提供更细致的模型安全性和鲁棒性评估。在复杂深度强化学习任务（如Habitat 3.0）和标准DNN验证基准测试中进行了实证验证。

Conclusion: Abstract DNN-Verification方法显著提升了DNN安全性分析的细粒度，同时保持了计算效率，为模型验证提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Traditional methods for formal verification (FV) of deep neural networks
(DNNs) are constrained by a binary encoding of safety properties, where a model
is classified as either safe or unsafe (robust or not robust). This binary
encoding fails to capture the nuanced safety levels within a model, often
resulting in either overly restrictive or too permissive requirements. In this
paper, we introduce a novel problem formulation called Abstract
DNN-Verification, which verifies a hierarchical structure of unsafe outputs,
providing a more granular analysis of the safety aspect for a given DNN.
Crucially, by leveraging abstract interpretation and reasoning about output
reachable sets, our approach enables assessing multiple safety levels during
the FV process, requiring the same (in the worst case) or even potentially less
computational effort than the traditional binary verification approach.
Specifically, we demonstrate how this formulation allows rank adversarial
inputs according to their abstract safety level violation, offering a more
detailed evaluation of the model's safety and robustness. Our contributions
include a theoretical exploration of the relationship between our novel
abstract safety formulation and existing approaches that employ abstract
interpretation for robustness verification, complexity analysis of the novel
problem introduced, and an empirical evaluation considering both a complex deep
reinforcement learning task (based on Habitat 3.0) and standard
DNN-Verification benchmarks.

showcased the effectiveness of the proposed methods, achieving state-of-the-art
results. Additionally, they paved the way for exploring new approaches in
artificial intelligence, foundation models, and generative artificial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAgent是一种边缘-云协作的多智能体框架，旨在解决（多模态）大语言模型在移动自动化中的高延迟和成本问题，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云端的（多模态）大语言模型虽具备强大推理能力，但存在高延迟和高成本问题；而边缘端的微调小模型虽可部署，但通用能力不足且难以处理复杂任务。

Method: 提出EcoAgent框架，通过云端规划智能体与边缘执行智能体和观察智能体的闭环协作，利用预理解模块压缩图像为文本以减少令牌消耗，并通过反射模块在失败时重新规划。

Result: 在AndroidWorld上的实验表明，EcoAgent在保持高任务成功率的同时显著减少了多模态大语言模型的令牌消耗。

Conclusion: EcoAgent实现了高效且实用的移动自动化，平衡了性能和资源消耗。

Abstract: Cloud-based mobile agents powered by (multimodal) large language models
((M)LLMs) offer strong reasoning abilities but suffer from high latency and
cost. While fine-tuned (M)SLMs enable edge deployment, they often lose general
capabilities and struggle with complex tasks. To address this, we propose
EcoAgent, an Edge-Cloud cOllaborative multi-agent framework for mobile
automation. EcoAgent features a closed-loop collaboration among a cloud-based
Planning Agent and two edge-based agents: the Execution Agent for action
execution and the Observation Agent for verifying outcomes. The Observation
Agent uses a Pre-Understanding Module to compress screen images into concise
text, reducing token usage. In case of failure, the Planning Agent retrieves
screen history and replans via a Reflection Module. Experiments on AndroidWorld
show that EcoAgent maintains high task success rates while significantly
reducing MLLM token consumption, enabling efficient and practical mobile
automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）实现对话式业务过程模型重设计的可行性，提出多步骤方法并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单次提示执行，缺乏用户与LLM持续交互的探索。本文旨在通过LLM赋能领域专家以迭代方式优化过程模型设计。

Method: 提出对话式过程模型重设计（CPD）方法，分三步：识别文献中的过程变化模式、对齐用户请求与模式语义、应用变更至模型。

Result: 评估显示LLM能较好处理多数变更，但部分模式对LLM和用户均有挑战，需辅助用户清晰描述变更需求。

Conclusion: LLM在业务过程管理中具备实用性，但仍需改进模式理解及用户支持机制以实现更高效迭代。

Abstract: With the recent success of large language models (LLMs), the idea of
AI-augmented Business Process Management systems is becoming more feasible. One
of their essential characteristics is the ability to be conversationally
actionable, allowing humans to interact with the LLM effectively to perform
crucial process life cycle tasks such as process model design and redesign.
However, most current research focuses on single-prompt execution and
evaluation of results, rather than on continuous interaction between the user
and the LLM. In this work, we aim to explore the feasibility of using LLMs to
empower domain experts in the creation and redesign of process models in an
iterative and effective way. The proposed conversational process model redesign
(CPD) approach receives as input a process model and a redesign request by the
user in natural language. Instead of just letting the LLM make changes, the LLM
is employed to (a) identify process change patterns from literature, (b)
re-phrase the change request to be aligned with an expected wording for the
identified pattern (i.e., the meaning), and then to (c) apply the meaning of
the change to the process model. This multi-step approach allows for
explainable and reproducible changes. In order to ensure the feasibility of the
CPD approach, and to find out how well the patterns from literature can be
handled by the LLM, we performed an extensive evaluation. The results show that
some patterns are hard to understand by LLMs and by users. Within the scope of
the study, we demonstrated that users need support to describe the changes
clearly. Overall the evaluation shows that the LLMs can handle most changes
well according to a set of completeness and correctness criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果效应评估主要关注平均因果效应，但缺乏对因果效应分布形状和变量间关系的全面分析。因此，本文旨在填补这一空白，研究因果效应的矩和乘积矩（如方差、协方差等）。

Method: 论文首先定义了因果效应的矩和乘积矩，并提出了相应的识别定理与边界。接着，通过实验从有限样本中估计这些矩，并使用真实医疗数据集验证其实际应用。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够有效估计因果效应的矩和乘积矩，并在真实数据中展示了其分析因果效应分布与关系的实用性。

Conclusion: 本文为因果效应的矩分析提供了理论基础与实用工具，扩展了传统因果推断的范围，使其能够更全面地分析因果效应的分布特性与变量间关系。

Abstract: The moments of random variables are fundamental statistical measures for
characterizing the shape of a probability distribution, encompassing metrics
such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, the product
moments, including covariance and correlation, reveal the relationships between
multiple random variables. On the other hand, the primary focus of causal
inference is the evaluation of causal effects, which are defined as the
difference between two potential outcomes. While traditional causal effect
assessment focuses on the average causal effect, this work provides
definitions, identification theorems, and bounds for moments and product
moments of causal effects to analyze their distribution and relationships. We
conduct experiments to illustrate the estimation of the moments of causal
effects from finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a
real-world medical dataset.

Conclusion: 路径特定的PNS分解为理解复杂因果机制提供了新工具，理论与实验验证了其可行性与实用性。

Abstract: Mediation analysis for probabilities of causation (PoC) provides a
fundamental framework for evaluating the necessity and sufficiency of treatment
in provoking an event through different causal pathways. One of the primary
objectives of causal mediation analysis is to decompose the total effect into
path-specific components. In this study, we investigate the path-specific
probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) to decompose the total PNS into
path-specific components along distinct causal pathways between treatment and
outcome, incorporating two mediators. We define the path-specific PNS for
decomposition and provide an identification theorem. Furthermore, we conduct
numerical experiments to assess the properties of the proposed estimators from
finite samples and demonstrate their practical application using a real-world
educational dataset.

Motivation: 应用评论是用户反馈的重要来源，但传统分类方法依赖大量领域特定数据，成本高。研究旨在探索零样本学习（如ChatGPT）能否高效分类评论，指导开发决策。

Method: 使用ChatGPT进行零样本学习，对来自10款多样化应用的1,880条人工标注评论分类，评估其性能，并分析评论可读性和长度的影响。

Result: ChatGPT在评论分类中表现优异（F1=0.842），但存在可读性和长度对准确性的影响，部分类别易误分类。

Conclusion: 零样本学习为应用评论分类提供了高效替代方案，尽管存在挑战，但ChatGPT展现了强大潜力。

Abstract: App reviews are a critical source of user feedback, offering valuable
insights into an app's performance, features, usability, and overall user
experience. Effectively analyzing these reviews is essential for guiding app
development, prioritizing feature updates, and enhancing user satisfaction.
Classifying reviews into functional and non-functional requirements play a
pivotal role in distinguishing feedback related to specific app features
(functional requirements) from feedback concerning broader quality attributes,
such as performance, usability, and reliability (non-functional requirements).
Both categories are integral to informed development decisions. Traditional
approaches to classifying app reviews are hindered by the need for large,
domain-specific datasets, which are often costly and time-consuming to curate.
This study explores the potential of zero-shot learning with ChatGPT for
classifying app reviews into four categories: functional requirement,
non-functional requirement, both, or neither. We evaluate ChatGPT's performance
on a benchmark dataset of 1,880 manually annotated reviews from ten diverse
apps spanning multiple domains. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT achieves
a robust F1 score of 0.842 in review classification, despite certain challenges
and limitations. Additionally, we examine how factors such as review
readability and length impact classification accuracy and conduct a manual
analysis to identify review categories more prone to misclassification.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为PR2的技术，用于改进C代码到Rust的转换工具C2RUST生成代码的内存安全性，通过消除原始指针并提升为合适的Rust数据结构，实验显示在28个真实项目中成功移除了13.22%的原始指针。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管C2RUST等工具可以将C代码转换为Rust，但生成的Rust代码大量依赖原始指针等不安全结构，影响了Rust的内存安全性优势。因此，论文旨在通过消除这些原始指针，提升转换后代码的安全性。

Method: 提出了一种基于peephole的原始指针重写技术（PR2），结合决策树提示提升指针到合适的Rust数据结构，并利用代码变更分析指导修复改写过程中引入的错误。

Result: 在28个真实C项目上的实验表明，PR2成功移除了13.22%的本地原始指针，平均每个项目的转换时间为5.44小时，成本约1.46美元。

Conclusion: PR2显著提升了C到Rust转换的安全性，虽然仍有优化空间，但证明了其在改进Rust代码安全性方面的有效性。

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in translating C code to Rust due to Rust's
robust memory and thread safety guarantees. Tools such as C2RUST enable
syntax-guided transpilation from C to semantically equivalent Rust code.
However, the resulting Rust programs often rely heavily on unsafe
constructs--particularly raw pointers--which undermines Rust's safety
guarantees. This paper aims to improve the memory safety of Rust programs
generated by C2RUST by eliminating raw pointers. Specifically, we propose a
peephole raw pointer rewriting technique that lifts raw pointers in individual
functions to appropriate Rust data structures. Technically, PR2 employs
decision-tree-based prompting to guide the pointer lifting process.
Additionally, it leverages code change analysis to guide the repair of errors
introduced during rewriting, effectively addressing errors encountered during
compilation and test case execution. We implement PR2 as a prototype and
evaluate it using gpt-4o-mini on 28 real-world C projects. The results show
that PR2 successfully eliminates 13.22% of local raw pointers across these
projects, significantly enhancing the safety of the translated Rust code. On
average, PR2 completes the transformation of a project in 5.44 hours, at an
average cost of $1.46.

Abstract: Code large language models (CodeLLMs) and agents have shown great promise in
tackling complex software engineering tasks.Compared to traditional software
engineering methods, CodeLLMs and agents offer stronger abilities, and can
flexibly process inputs and outputs in both natural and code. Benchmarking
plays a crucial role in evaluating the capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents,
guiding their development and deployment. However, despite their growing
significance, there remains a lack of comprehensive reviews of benchmarks for
CodeLLMs and agents. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive
review of existing benchmarks for CodeLLMs and agents, studying and analyzing
181 benchmarks from 461 relevant papers, covering the different phases of the
software development life cycle (SDLC). Our findings reveal a notable imbalance
in the coverage of current benchmarks, with approximately 60% focused on the
software development phase in SDLC, while requirements engineering and software
design phases receive minimal attention at only 5% and 3%, respectively.
Additionally, Python emerges as the dominant programming language across the
reviewed benchmarks. Finally, this paper highlights the challenges of current
research and proposes future directions, aiming to narrow the gap between the
theoretical capabilities of CodeLLMs and agents and their application in
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决复杂知识图谱模式在Text2Cypher任务中带来的噪声、幻觉问题和计算成本高的问题，探索模式过滤的优化效果。

Method: 提出多种模式过滤方法，分析其对令牌长度、性能和成本的影响。

Result: 模式过滤显著优化Text2Cypher任务，尤其对小模型效果更明显；大模型因上下文能力较强收益较小，但仍能降低成本。

Conclusion: 模式过滤是优化Text2Cypher的有效方法，尤其适用于资源受限场景，同时对所有模型均有成本效益。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent complex data using nodes, relationships, and
properties. Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables
efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models
allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries -
Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts.
However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and
raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by
including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while
reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for
Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and
cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher,
especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that
larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context
capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and
smaller models in cost reduction.

Result: 实验表明，这些技术可以显著减少训练时间和成本（减半），同时对性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 难例选择是一种高效且经济的解决方案，能够在降低资源使用的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Database query languages such as SQL for relational databases and Cypher for
graph databases have been widely adopted. Recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) enable natural language interactions with databases through
models like Text2SQL and Text2Cypher. Fine-tuning these models typically
requires large, diverse datasets containing non-trivial examples. However, as
dataset size increases, the cost of fine-tuning also rises. This makes smaller,
high-quality datasets essential for reducing costs for the same or better
performance. In this paper, we propose five hard-example selection techniques
for pruning the Text2Cypher dataset, aiming to preserve or improve performance
while reducing resource usage. Our results show that these hard-example
selection approaches can halve training time and costs with minimal impact on
performance, and demonstrates that hard-example selection provides a
cost-effective solution.

### [142] [High-fidelity Grain Growth Modeling: Leveraging Deep Learning for Fast Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05354)
*Pungponhavoan Tep,Marc Bernacki*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的高效晶粒生长模拟方法，通过结合卷积长短时记忆网络和自编码器，显著提升了计算速度，同时保持了高精度的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用卷积长短时记忆网络与自编码器的结合，并引入混合损失函数（包括均方误差、结构相似性指数和边界保留）来捕捉晶粒生长的时空特征并保持结构完整性。

Result: 该方法将计算时间从10分钟缩短至约10秒，加速效果达89倍，最佳模型的结构相似性得分为86.71%，平均晶粒尺寸误差仅为0.07%。

Conclusion: 该机器学习框架为材料科学和制造中的微观结构快速预测提供了高效工具，有望推动材料创新。

Abstract: Grain growth simulation is crucial for predicting metallic material
microstructure evolution during annealing and resulting final mechanical
properties, but traditional partial differential equation-based methods are
computationally expensive, creating bottlenecks in materials design and
manufacturing. In this work, we introduce a machine learning framework that
combines a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory networks with an Autoencoder to
efficiently predict grain growth evolution. Our approach captures both spatial
and temporal aspects of grain evolution while encoding high-dimensional grain
structure data into a compact latent space for pattern learning, enhanced by a
novel composite loss function combining Mean Squared Error, Structural
Similarity Index Measurement, and Boundary Preservation to maintain structural
integrity of grain boundary topology of the prediction. Results demonstrated
that our machine learning approach accelerates grain growth prediction by up to
\SI{89}{\times} faster, reducing computation time from \SI{10}{\minute} to
approximately \SI{10}{\second} while maintaining high-fidelity predictions. The
best model (S-30-30) achieving a structural similarity score of
\SI{86.71}{\percent} and mean grain size error of just \SI{0.07}{\percent}. All
models accurately captured grain boundary topology, morphology, and size
distributions. This approach enables rapid microstructural prediction for
applications where conventional simulations are prohibitively time-consuming,
potentially accelerating innovation in materials science and manufacturing.

### [143] [Local linear Fréchet curve regression in manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05168)
*M. D. Ruiz-Medina,A. Torres--Signes*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: 该论文解决了从时间相关的双变量曲线数据中，通过外在与内在方法局部线性逼近Fréchet条件均值的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于处理流形中评估的时间相关双变量曲线数据集，提出局部线性Fréchet函数回归预测器。

Method: 方法包括外在预测器（通过投影到切空间）和内在预测器（加权Fréchet均值），并通过指数和对数映射实现计算。

Result: 结果证明了内在局部逼近的渐近最优性，并通过仿真和NASA MAGSAT卫星的实际数据验证了预测器的性能。

Conclusion: 结论表明，外在与内在方法在局部线性Fréchet回归中均有效，且内在方法具有渐近最优性。

Abstract: Global Fr\'echet functional regression has been recently addressed from time
correlated bivariate curve data evaluated in a manifold (see Torres et al.
2025). For this type of curve data sets, the present paper solves the problem
of local linear approximation of the Fr\'echet conditional mean in an extrinsic
and intrinsic way. The extrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor is obtained in the time varying tangent space by projection into an
orthornormal basis of the ambient Hilbert space. The conditions assumed ensure
the existence and uniqueness of this predictor, and its computation via
exponential and logarithmic maps. A weighted Fr\'echet mean approach is adopted
in the computation of an intrinsic local linear Fr\'echet functional regression
predictor. The asymptotic optimality of this intrinsic local approximation is
also proved. The performance of the empirical version of both, extrinsic and
intrinsic functional predictors, and of a Nadaraya-Watson type Fr\'echet curve
predictor is illustrated in the simulation study undertaken. The finite-sample
size properties are also tested in a real-data application via
cross-validation. Specifically, functional prediction of the magnetic vector
field from the time-varying geocentric latitude and longitude of the satellite
NASA's MAGSAT spacecraft is addressed.

### [144] [Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420)
*Mario U. Gaimann,Miriam Klopotek*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了活性物质在储层计算（RC）范式中的信息处理能力，发现了一种被忽视的最优动态机制，适用于多种物理参数和推断任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在理解物理系统（尤其是非平衡状态下的多体系统）如何通过自身动态特性实现高效信息处理和推断。

Method: 通过模拟外部驱动的活性物质模型，分析其动态松弛能力和对混沌信号的未来状态推断能力。

Result: 发现最优计算机制位于临界阻尼阈值以下，涉及多阶段微观动态松弛，且对混沌驱动具有适应性。

Conclusion: 研究为物理系统的学习和非常规计算提供了新视角，揭示了动态松弛和多尺度响应对信息处理的关键作用。

Abstract: We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the
reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to
infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely
follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime
of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly
optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing
valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more
generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing
are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.
These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference
goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The
regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical
damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple
stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to
a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between
quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and
incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales
of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the
best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the
responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is
interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding
learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body
physics out of equilibrium.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 促进中学数学到STEM教育的平滑过渡，并利用定理证明技术提供软件支持。

Method: 举办国际研讨会，征集并接受相关论文，展示自动演绎研究和教育应用。

Result: 共有9篇投稿，8篇被接受，内容涵盖自动演绎研究及其教育应用。

Conclusion: 该论文集旨在进一步推动基于定理证明的软件发展，并促进计算机科学家、数学家和教育利益相关者之间的相互理解。

Abstract: The ThEdu series pursues the smooth transition from an intuitive way of doing
mathematics at secondary school to a more formal approach to the subject in
STEM education while favoring software support for this transition by
exploiting the power of theorem-proving technologies. What follows is a brief
description of how the present volume contributes to this enterprise. The 13th
International Workshop on Theorem Proving Components for Educational Software
(ThEdu'24), was a satellite event of the CADE29, part of IJCAR 2024, Nancy,
France. ThEdu'24 was a vibrant workshop, with one invited talk by Jeremy Avigad
(Carnegie Mellon University) and 14 submitted talks. An open call for papers
was then issued and attracted 9 submissions. Eight of those submissions have
been accepted by our reviewers. The resulting revised papers are collected in
the present volume. The contributions in this volume are a faithful
representation of the wide spectrum of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused
on the automated deduction research, not losing track of the possible
applications in an educational setting, to those focused on the applications,
in educational settings, of automated deduction tools and methods. We, the
volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will further promote the
development of theorem-proving-based software and that it will allow to improve
the mutual understanding between computer scientists, mathematicians, and
stakeholders in education. While this volume goes to press, the next edition of
the ThEdu workshop is being prepared: ThEdu'25 will be a satellite event of the
30th international Conference on Automated DEduction (CADE-30), July 28th -
August 2nd, 2025, Stuttgart, Germany.

### [146] [Cryptogenic stroke and migraine: using probabilistic independence and machine learning to uncover latent sources of disease from the electronic health record](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04631)
*Joshua W. Betts,John M. Still,Thomas A. Lasko*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据驱动方法，通过电子健康记录（EHR）数据提取概率独立源，构建了偏头痛患者10年内隐源性卒中（CS）的风险预测模型，准确率较高（ROC 0.771），并识别了药物干预和过敏性鼻炎等关键风险因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏头痛是一种复杂且常见的神经系统疾病，会增加隐源性卒中的风险，但目前相关研究较少，临床指南缺乏。

Method: 利用EHR数据提取概率独立源，构建随机森林模型预测偏头痛患者的CS风险。

Result: 模型准确率较好（ROC 0.771），识别出药物干预是最重要的风险降低因素，并发现过敏性鼻炎可能是CS的潜在诱因。

Conclusion: 通过数据驱动方法识别偏头痛患者CS风险的关键因素，为临床干预提供了新方向。

Abstract: Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder that doubles the
lifetime risk of cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, this relationship remains
poorly characterized, and few clinical guidelines exist to reduce this
associated risk. We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract
probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data
and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These
sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph
constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our
population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these
sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most
predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that
pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS
risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as
a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients.

### [147] [ICNN-enhanced 2SP: Leveraging input convex neural networks for solving two-stage stochastic programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05261)
*Yu Liu,Fabricio Oliveira*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于输入凸神经网络（ICNN）的两阶段随机规划方法（ICNN-enhanced 2SP），通过利用线性规划的表示能力，显著提升了计算效率，并在保持解质量的同时实现了高达100倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Neur2SP虽使用神经网络作为追索函数的替代，但依赖计算密集的混合整数规划（MIP）。ICNN-enhanced 2SP旨在通过ICNN的凸性保证和线性规划提升计算效率，解决大规模问题的挑战。

Method: 采用输入凸神经网络（ICNN）作为追索函数的替代模型，通过结构强制凸性和线性规划实现精确推断，避免了传统MIP方法中的整数变量需求。

Result: 实验表明，ICNN-enhanced 2SP训练时间略长但验证精度与MIP方法相当，且在基准问题上通常比MIP方法更快，问题规模越大优势越明显。最高可实现100倍加速，且解质量更优。

Conclusion: ICNN-enhanced 2SP是一种高效的两阶段随机规划方法，能够在保持解质量的同时显著提升计算效率，特别适用于大规模问题。

Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling
decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to
the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing
learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP)
employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on
computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We
propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks
(ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP
problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference
through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to
the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of
the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more
computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality.
Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer
training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based
counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits
considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while
preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more
pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the
method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to
MIP-based formulations.

*Sriram Mandalika,Harsha Vardhan,Athira Nambiar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的无监督持续学习方法R2R，通过生成性回放和不确定性驱动机制来提高神经网络的知识保留能力，避免了传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，提出一种无需预训练即可高效利用未标记和合成标记数据的方法。

Method: 使用基于聚类的不确定性估计和动态阈值技术，结合生成性回放模块，动态平衡未标记和合成数据的使用。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100等）上表现优异，知识保留率最高达98.13%，优于现有方法4.36%。

Conclusion: R2R框架通过不确定性驱动和生成性回放，实现了高效的持续学习，显著提升了知识保留能力。

Abstract: Continual Learning entails progressively acquiring knowledge from new data
while retaining previously acquired knowledge, thereby mitigating
``Catastrophic Forgetting'' in neural networks. Our work presents a novel
uncertainty-driven Unsupervised Continual Learning framework using Generative
Replay, namely ``Replay to Remember (R2R)''. The proposed R2R architecture
efficiently uses unlabelled and synthetic labelled data in a balanced
proportion using a cluster-level uncertainty-driven feedback mechanism and a
VLM-powered generative replay module. Unlike traditional memory-buffer methods
that depend on pretrained models and pseudo-labels, our R2R framework operates
without any prior training. It leverages visual features from unlabeled data
and adapts continuously using clustering-based uncertainty estimation coupled
with dynamic thresholding. Concurrently, a generative replay mechanism along
with DeepSeek-R1 powered CLIP VLM produces labelled synthetic data
representative of past experiences, resembling biological visual thinking that
replays memory to remember and act in new, unseen tasks. Extensive experimental
analyses are carried out in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, SVHN and
TinyImageNet datasets. Our proposed R2R approach improves knowledge retention,
achieving a state-of-the-art performance of 98.13%, 73.06%, 93.41%, 95.18%,
59.74%, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art performance by over 4.36%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像对齐方法在特征稀疏区域、大尺度差异和大变形情况下表现不佳，提出ART方法以提高鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 采用自回归框架，结合多尺度特征和跨注意力机制，迭代优化变换场，并在每个尺度随机采样点进行细化。

Result: 在多样数据集上的实验显示，ART方法在精确图像对齐方面显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: ART是一种强大的新方法，适用于广泛场景的精确图像对齐。

Abstract: Existing methods for image alignment struggle in cases involving
feature-sparse regions, extreme scale and field-of-view differences, and large
deformations, often resulting in suboptimal accuracy. Robustness to these
challenges improves through iterative refinement of the transformation field
while focusing on critical regions in multi-scale image representations. We
thus propose Auto-Regressive Transformation (ART), a novel method that
iteratively estimates the coarse-to-fine transformations within an
auto-regressive framework. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale features, our
network refines the transformations using randomly sampled points at each
scale. By incorporating guidance from the cross-attention layer, the model
focuses on critical regions, ensuring accurate alignment even in challenging,
feature-limited conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
demonstrate that ART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
establishing it as a powerful new method for precise image alignment with broad
applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialPrompting是一个新颖的框架，利用现成的多模态大语言模型的推理能力，实现了三维环境中的零样本空间推理，无需昂贵的3D特定微调或专用输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法依赖昂贵的3D特定微调和专用输入（如点云或体素特征），SpatialPrompting旨在通过视觉和位置线索实现更灵活、可扩展的空间推理。

Method: 采用关键帧驱动的提示生成策略，通过视觉-语言相似性、马氏距离、视场和图像清晰度等指标选择关键帧，并结合相机位姿数据抽象空间关系。

Result: 在ScanQA和SQA3D等基准数据集上实现了零样本最先进的性能，无需专用3D输入或微调。

Conclusion: SpatialPrompting为空间推理提供了一种更简单、更可扩展的替代方案，消除了对专用3D输入和微调的依赖。

Abstract: This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the
emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language
models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D)
environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific
fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based
features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation
strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity,
Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse
and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them
with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial
relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only
establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes
intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art
zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across
several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for
specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable
alternative to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法通过小数据策略迁移和关键技术优化，实现了高效、低成本的MPQ，为神经网络量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) has become an essential technique for
optimizing neural network by determining the optimal bitwidth per layer.
Existing MPQ methods, however, face a major hurdle: they require a
computationally expensive search for quantization policies on large-scale
datasets. To resolve this issue, we introduce a novel approach that first
searches for quantization policies on small datasets and then generalizes them
to large-scale datasets. This approach simplifies the process, eliminating the
need for large-scale quantization fine-tuning and only necessitating model
weight adjustment. Our method is characterized by three key techniques:
sharpness-aware minimization for enhanced quantization generalization, implicit
gradient direction alignment to handle gradient conflicts among different
optimization objectives, and an adaptive perturbation radius to accelerate
optimization. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate our
approach. Using the CIFAR10 dataset (just 0.5\% the size of ImageNet training
data) for MPQ policy search, we achieved equivalent accuracy on ImageNet with a
significantly lower computational cost, while improving efficiency by up to
150% over the baselines.

Abstract: Reasoning lies at the heart of intelligence, shaping the ability to make
decisions, draw conclusions, and generalize across domains. In artificial
intelligence, as systems increasingly operate in open, uncertain, and
multimodal environments, reasoning becomes essential for enabling robust and
adaptive behavior. Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) have emerged as a
promising paradigm, integrating modalities such as text, images, audio, and
video to support complex reasoning capabilities and aiming to achieve
comprehensive perception, precise understanding, and deep reasoning. As
research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular,
perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer
more coherent cross-modal understanding. While instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning have improved model reasoning, significant challenges
remain in omni-modal generalization, reasoning depth, and agentic behavior. To
address these issues, we present a comprehensive and structured survey of
multimodal reasoning research, organized around a four-stage developmental
roadmap that reflects the field's shifting design philosophies and emerging
capabilities. First, we review early efforts based on task-specific modules,
where reasoning was implicitly embedded across stages of representation,
alignment, and fusion. Next, we examine recent approaches that unify reasoning
into multimodal LLMs, with advances such as Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)
and multimodal reinforcement learning enabling richer and more structured
reasoning chains. Finally, drawing on empirical insights from challenging
benchmarks and experimental cases of OpenAI O3 and O4-mini, we discuss the
conceptual direction of native large multimodal reasoning models (N-LMRMs),
which aim to support scalable, agentic, and adaptive reasoning and planning in
complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advancements in scalable deep architectures and large-scale
pretraining, text-to-video generation has achieved unprecedented capabilities
in producing high-fidelity, instruction-following content across a wide range
of styles, enabling applications in advertising, entertainment, and education.
However, these models' ability to render precise on-screen text, such as
captions or mathematical formulas, remains largely untested, posing significant
challenges for applications requiring exact textual accuracy. In this work, we
introduce T2VTextBench, the first human-evaluation benchmark dedicated to
evaluating on-screen text fidelity and temporal consistency in text-to-video
models. Our suite of prompts integrates complex text strings with dynamic scene
changes, testing each model's ability to maintain detailed instructions across

solutions to commercial offerings, and find that most struggle to generate
legible, consistent text. These results highlight a critical gap in current
video generators and provide a clear direction for future research aimed at
enhancing textual manipulation in video synthesis.

Motivation: 深层伪造技术对社会造成混淆、欺骗及信任危机，现有检测器泛化能力不足，需开发新方法应对其快速演化。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DFDC基准测试中，跨数据集评估下性能分别提升5%和7%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多特征解耦与集成显著提升检测泛化能力，为应对深层伪造提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remarkable advancements in generative AI technology have given rise to a
spectrum of novel deepfake categories with unprecedented leaps in their
realism, and deepfakes are increasingly becoming a nuisance to law enforcement
authorities and the general public. In particular, we observe alarming levels
of confusion, deception, and loss of faith regarding multimedia content within
society caused by face deepfakes, and existing deepfake detectors are
struggling to keep up with the pace of improvements in deepfake generation.
This is primarily due to their reliance on specific forgery artifacts, which
limits their ability to generalise and detect novel deepfake types. To combat
the spread of malicious face deepfakes, this paper proposes a new strategy that
leverages coarse-to-fine spatial information, semantic information, and their
interactions while ensuring feature distinctiveness and reducing the redundancy
of the modelled features. A novel feature orthogonality-based disentanglement
strategy is introduced to ensure branch-level and cross-branch feature
disentanglement, which allows us to integrate multiple feature vectors without
adding complexity to the feature space or compromising generalisation.
Comprehensive experiments on three public benchmarks: FaceForensics++,
Celeb-DF, and the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) show that these design
choices enable the proposed approach to outperform current state-of-the-art
methods by 5% on the Celeb-DF dataset and 7% on the DFDC dataset in a
cross-dataset evaluation setting.

Abstract: Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a
foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training
computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of
high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer
that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and
incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal
autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level
discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level
continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize
high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension
and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers
without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results
demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual
tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level
generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in
both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at

Abstract: Visual Document Understanding has become essential with the increase of
text-rich visual content. This field poses significant challenges due to the
need for effective integration of visual perception and textual comprehension,
particularly across diverse document types with complex layouts. Moreover,
existing fine-tuning datasets for this domain often fall short in providing the
detailed contextual information for robust understanding, leading to
hallucinations and limited comprehension of spatial relationships among visual
elements. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative pipeline that
utilizes adaptive generation of markup languages, such as Markdown, JSON, HTML,
and TiKZ, to build highly structured document representations and deliver
contextually-grounded responses. We introduce two fine-grained structured
datasets: DocMark-Pile, comprising approximately 3.8M pretraining data pairs
for document parsing, and DocMark-Instruct, featuring 624k fine-tuning data
annotations for grounded instruction following. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-theart MLLMs across a range of visual document understanding
benchmarks, facilitating advanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities in
complex visual scenarios. Our code and models are released at https://github.

TL;DR: 论文研究了六种姿态追踪器在短跑生物力学分析中的表现，通过实验比较了它们的误差，并提出了后处理模块以改进结果。结果显示关节追踪器表现较好，但高精度应用仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，深度学习和大数据推动了人体姿态估计的发展，但高精度应用仍存挑战。本文旨在通过比较不同姿态追踪器在短跑生物力学分析中的表现，验证其可行性并提出改进方法。

Method: 实验使用六种姿态追踪器（两点追踪器和四种关节追踪器），对比其在5870帧短跑数据（来自5名专业运动员）上的表现。后处理模块用于检测异常值和融合关节角度预测。

Result: 关节追踪器的均方根误差为11.41°到4.37°，加入后处理后降至6.99°到3.88°。结果表明，姿态追踪可用于跑步生物力学分析，但高精度场景仍需优化。

Conclusion: 基于关节的姿态追踪对生物力学分析有价值，但需进一步改进其精度以满足高要求应用。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years,
mainly due to the integration of deep learning models, the availability of a
vast amount of data, and large computational resources. These developments have
led to highly accurate body tracking systems, which have direct applications in
sports analysis and performance evaluation.
  This work analyzes the performance of six trackers: two point trackers and
four joint trackers for biomechanical analysis in sprints. The proposed
framework compares the results obtained from these pose trackers with the
manual annotations of biomechanical experts for more than 5870 frames. The
experimental framework employs forty sprints from five professional runners,
focusing on three key angles in sprint biomechanics: trunk inclination, hip
flex extension, and knee flex extension. We propose a post-processing module
for outlier detection and fusion prediction in the joint angles.
  The experimental results demonstrate that using joint-based models yields
root mean squared errors ranging from 11.41{\deg} to 4.37{\deg}. When
integrated with the post-processing modules, these errors can be reduced to
6.99{\deg} and 3.88{\deg}, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that
human pose tracking approaches can be valuable resources for the biomechanical
analysis of running. However, there is still room for improvement in
applications where high accuracy is required.

Abstract: We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout
generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods
are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for

an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning
benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we
show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly
combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a
pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn
in image editing applications.

Motivation: 传统视频拼接方法在时间维度上可能导致画面抖动（warping shake），影响视觉体验。论文旨在解决这一问题，实现空间拼接与时间稳定的联合优化。

Method: 1. 引入虚拟中平面，设计双向分解模块均匀分配投影变形；2. 结合空间与时域变换推导拼接轨迹表达式；3. 提出混合损失函数同步优化对齐、平滑性与在线协作。

Conclusion: StabStitch++通过联合优化空间与时域处理，显著提升了视频拼接的稳定性与质量，推动了该领域的实际应用。

Abstract: We retarget video stitching to an emerging issue, named warping shake, which
unveils the temporal content shakes induced by sequentially unsmooth warps when
extending image stitching to video stitching. Even if the input videos are
stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and
affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a
novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal
stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from
existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image
to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image
planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable
bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation
and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens
and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in
video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching
trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal
warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched
videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment,
trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that
sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and
optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To
establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a
video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes.
Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching
performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in
this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in multimodal tasks
such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification but struggles with
fine-grained understanding due to its focus on coarse-grained short captions.
To address this, we propose Fine-Grained CLIP (FG-CLIP), which enhances
fine-grained understanding through three key innovations. First, we leverage
large multimodal models to generate 1.6 billion long caption-image pairs for
capturing global-level semantic details. Second, a high-quality dataset is
constructed with 12 million images and 40 million region-specific bounding
boxes aligned with detailed captions to ensure precise, context-rich
representations. Third, 10 million hard fine-grained negative samples are
incorporated to improve the model's ability to distinguish subtle semantic
differences. Corresponding training methods are meticulously designed for these
data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FG-CLIP outperforms the original
CLIP and other state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks,
including fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection,
image-text retrieval, and general multimodal benchmarks. These results
highlight FG-CLIP's effectiveness in capturing fine-grained image details and
improving overall model performance. The related data, code, and models are

Conclusion: Biomed-DPT通过知识与注意力机制的双重优化，显著提升了生物医学图像分类性能，尤其在少样本场景中。

Abstract: Prompt learning is one of the most effective paradigms for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to the biomedical image
classification tasks in few shot scenarios. However, most of the current prompt
learning methods only used the text prompts and ignored the particular
structures (such as the complex anatomical structures and subtle pathological
features) in the biomedical images. In this work, we propose Biomed-DPT, a
knowledge-enhanced dual modality prompt tuning technique. In designing the text
prompt, Biomed-DPT constructs a dual prompt including the template-driven
clinical prompts and the large language model (LLM)-driven domain-adapted
prompts, then extracts the clinical knowledge from the domain-adapted prompts
through the knowledge distillation technique. In designing the vision prompt,
Biomed-DPT introduces the zero vector as a soft prompt to leverage attention
re-weighting so that the focus on non-diagnostic regions and the recognition of
non-critical pathological features are avoided. Biomed-DPT achieves an average
classification accuracy of 66.14\% across 11 biomedical image datasets covering
9 modalities and 10 organs, with performance reaching 78.06\% in base classes
and 75.97\% in novel classes, surpassing the Context Optimization (CoOp) method
by 6.20\%, 3.78\%, and 8.04\%, respectively. Our code are available at

Abstract: Thoracolumbar stump ribs are one of the essential indicators of thoracolumbar
transitional vertebrae or enumeration anomalies. While some studies manually
assess these anomalies and describe the ribs qualitatively, this study aims to
automate thoracolumbar stump rib detection and analyze their morphology
quantitatively. To this end, we train a high-resolution deep-learning model for
rib segmentation and show significant improvements compared to existing models
(Dice score 0.997 vs. 0.779, p-value < 0.01). In addition, we use an iterative
algorithm and piece-wise linear interpolation to assess the length of the ribs,
showing a success rate of 98.2%. When analyzing morphological features, we show
that stump ribs articulate more posteriorly at the vertebrae (-19.2 +- 3.8 vs
-13.8 +- 2.5, p-value < 0.01), are thinner (260.6 +- 103.4 vs. 563.6 +- 127.1,
p-value < 0.01), and are oriented more downwards and sideways within the first
centimeters in contrast to full-length ribs. We show that with partially
visible ribs, these features can achieve an F1-score of 0.84 in differentiating
stump ribs from regular ones. We publish the model weights and masks for public
use.

Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D
Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual
prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is
to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared
with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding,
this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple
valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and
free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation
protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as
well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that
this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of
benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has surpassed human performance on standard benchmarks,
driving its widespread adoption in computer vision tasks. One such task is
disparity estimation, estimating the disparity between matching pixels in
stereo image pairs, which is crucial for safety-critical applications like
medical surgeries and autonomous navigation. However, DL-based disparity
estimation methods are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and
adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their reliability and
generalization. Despite these concerns, a standardized benchmark for evaluating
the robustness of disparity estimation methods remains absent, hindering
progress in the field.
  To address this gap, we introduce DispBench, a comprehensive benchmarking
tool for systematically assessing the reliability of disparity estimation
methods. DispBench evaluates robustness against synthetic image corruptions
such as adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution shifts caused by 2D Common
Corruptions across multiple datasets and diverse corruption scenarios. We
conduct the most extensive performance and robustness analysis of disparity
estimation methods to date, uncovering key correlations between accuracy,
reliability, and generalization. Open-source code for DispBench:

Abstract: Accurate building segmentation from high-resolution RGB imagery remains
challenging due to spectral similarity with non-building features, shadows, and
irregular building geometries. In this study, we present a comprehensive deep
learning framework for multiscale building segmentation using RGB aerial and
satellite imagery with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.4m to 2.7m. We curate
a diverse, multi-sensor dataset and introduce feature-augmented inputs by
deriving secondary representations including Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), Visible Difference Vegetation Index (VDVI), Morphological Building Index
(MBI), and Sobel edge filters from RGB channels. These features guide a
Res-U-Net architecture in learning complex spatial patterns more effectively.
We also propose training policies incorporating layer freezing, cyclical
learning rates, and SuperConvergence to reduce training time and resource
usage. Evaluated on a held-out WorldView-3 image, our model achieves an overall
accuracy of 96.5%, an F1-score of 0.86, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of

Abstract: Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips,
provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios.
However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has
become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a
promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data
distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples.
Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional
artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this
gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time
adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution
shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which
dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired
normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in

*Aishwarya Venkataramanan,Paul Bodesheim,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroVE是一种通过高斯过程隐变量模型（GPLVM）从冻结的视觉语言模型（VLMs）中获取概率嵌入的后处理方法，可生成具有不确定性的嵌入表示，并在多个下游任务中实现最优的不确定性校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准VLM的确定性嵌入难以捕捉视觉和文本描述中的模糊性及多种对应关系的潜在不确定性，现有方法需大规模数据集训练且无法利用已训练的大型VLM（如CLIP）的表示能力。

Method: 基于GPLVM构建共享低维隐空间，通过单模态嵌入重建和跨模态对齐目标优化，生成不确定性感知的概率嵌入。

Result: 在跨模态检索、视觉问答和主动学习等任务中，GroVE实现了最先进的不确定性校准。

Conclusion: GroVE提供了一种高效的后处理方案，能在不重新训练VLM的情况下增强其不确定性建模能力，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn joint representations by mapping images
and text into a shared latent space. However, recent research highlights that
deterministic embeddings from standard VLMs often struggle to capture the
uncertainties arising from the ambiguities in visual and textual descriptions
and the multiple possible correspondences between images and texts. Existing
approaches tackle this by learning probabilistic embeddings during VLM
training, which demands large datasets and does not leverage the powerful
representations already learned by large-scale VLMs like CLIP. In this paper,
we propose GroVE, a post-hoc approach to obtaining probabilistic embeddings
from frozen VLMs. GroVE builds on Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
(GPLVM) to learn a shared low-dimensional latent space where image and text
inputs are mapped to a unified representation, optimized through single-modal
embedding reconstruction and cross-modal alignment objectives. Once trained,
the Gaussian Process model generates uncertainty-aware probabilistic
embeddings. Evaluation shows that GroVE achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty
calibration across multiple downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval,
visual question answering, and active learning.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了PaniCar现象，即紧急车辆灯光会降低自动驾驶汽车目标检测的置信度，并提出Caracetamol框架以增强检测器的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车的安全性受到质疑，尤其是在紧急车辆灯光环境下目标检测性能下降的问题。

Method: 评估了7种商用ADAS、4种目标检测器和14种紧急车辆灯光模式，并提出了Caracetamol框架。

Result: Caracetamol显著提升了YOLOv3和Faster RCNN的检测置信度和稳定性，且满足实时处理需求。

Conclusion: Caracetamol能有效应对紧急车辆灯光对目标检测的干扰，提升自动驾驶汽车的安全性。

Abstract: The safety of autonomous cars has come under scrutiny in recent years,
especially after 16 documented incidents involving Teslas (with autopilot
engaged) crashing into parked emergency vehicles (police cars, ambulances, and
firetrucks). While previous studies have revealed that strong light sources
often introduce flare artifacts in the captured image, which degrade the image
quality, the impact of flare on object detection performance remains unclear.
In this research, we unveil PaniCar, a digital phenomenon that causes an object
detector's confidence score to fluctuate below detection thresholds when
exposed to activated emergency vehicle lighting. This vulnerability poses a
significant safety risk, and can cause autonomous vehicles to fail to detect
objects near emergency vehicles. In addition, this vulnerability could be
exploited by adversaries to compromise the security of advanced driving
assistance systems (ADASs). We assess seven commercial ADASs (Tesla Model 3,
"manufacturer C", HP, Pelsee, AZDOME, Imagebon, Rexing), four object detectors
(YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN), and 14 patterns of emergency vehicle
lighting to understand the influence of various technical and environmental
factors. We also evaluate four SOTA flare removal methods and show that their
performance and latency are insufficient for real-time driving constraints. To
mitigate this risk, we propose Caracetamol, a robust framework designed to
enhance the resilience of object detectors against the effects of activated
emergency vehicle lighting. Our evaluation shows that on YOLOv3 and Faster
RCNN, Caracetamol improves the models' average confidence of car detection by
0.20, the lower confidence bound by 0.33, and reduces the fluctuation range by
0.33. In addition, Caracetamol is capable of processing frames at a rate of
between 30-50 FPS, enabling real-time ADAS car detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow-GRPO将在线强化学习（RL）融入流匹配模型，通过ODE-to-SDE转换和降噪策略提升采样效率，在文本到图像任务中表现优异，显著提升生成准确性和人类偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流匹配模型在生成任务中缺乏强化学习的探索能力，Flow-GRPO旨在通过在线RL提升模型的生成质量和效率。

Method: 1. ODE-to-SDE转换：将确定性ODE转为等价的SDE，支持RL探索；2. 降噪策略：减少训练降噪步骤，保持推理步数不变。

Result: 在复杂构图和视觉文本任务中，GenEval准确率从63%提升至95%，文本渲染准确率从59%升至92%，且未出现奖励作弊现象。

Conclusion: Flow-GRPO有效结合RL与流匹配模型，显著提升生成性能与效率，同时保持图像质量与多样性。

Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement
learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies:
(1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation
(SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps,
enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction
strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original
inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without
performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple
text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly
perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting
GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy
improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation.
Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment.
Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase
at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our
experiments.

*Conor Rowan,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: PINN在解决重建问题时可能因假设物理一致性而无法满足可解释性、鲁棒性和数据一致性。通过提出ECFM方法，可以控制约束力，从而在物理参数不一致的情况下实现更可预测的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究中发现，物理信息神经网络（PINN）在状态重建时，若假设的物理方程与真实物理现象不一致，可能导致结果不可靠。为确保重建质量、鲁棒性和数据一致性，需改进方法。

Method: 提出“显式约束力方法”（ECFM），通过显式控制约束力（即约束引入的附加源项），避免物理损失和约束方式对重建结果的过度影响。

Result: ECFM方法在弹性和热传导问题中表现更优，即使物理参数不一致，仍能实现可预测、可定制的重建。

Conclusion: ECFM通过满足可解释性、鲁棒性和数据一致性，提升了PINN在不一致物理参数下的重建能力。

Abstract: One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution
reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical
system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the
system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression
problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the
parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical
phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming
consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches
may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and
data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of
the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend
strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations,
the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity
and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss
and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data
lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source
terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can
significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially
substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint
enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint
force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the
constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability,
robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and
customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the
parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured
system.

<details>

Method: 借鉴U统计量文献，推导非独立同分布下的CRL泛化界，分析样本数量与覆盖数的对数关系。

Result: 提出了适用于非独立同分布设置的泛化界，并应用于线性映射和神经网络，得到了超额风险界。

Conclusion: 为CRL在更实际场景中的理论分析提供了基础，泛化性能与特征表示类的覆盖数相关。

Abstract: Contrastive Representation Learning (CRL) has achieved impressive success in
various domains in recent years. Nevertheless, the theoretical understanding of
the generalization behavior of CRL is limited. Moreover, to the best of our
knowledge, the current literature only analyzes generalization bounds under the
assumption that the data tuples used for contrastive learning are independently
and identically distributed. However, in practice, we are often limited to a
fixed pool of reusable labeled data points, making it inevitable to recycle
data across tuples to create sufficiently large datasets. Therefore, the
tuple-wise independence condition imposed by previous works is invalidated. In
this paper, we provide a generalization analysis for the CRL framework under
non-$i.i.d.$ settings that adheres to practice more realistically. Drawing
inspiration from the literature on U-statistics, we derive generalization
bounds which indicate the required number of samples in each class scales as
the logarithm of the covering number of the class of learnable feature
representations associated to each class. Next, we apply our main results to
derive excess risk bounds for common function classes such as linear maps and
neural networks.

Abstract: The identification of a linear system model from data has wide applications
in control theory. The existing work that provides finite sample guarantees for
linear system identification typically uses data from a single long system
trajectory under i.i.d. random inputs, and assumes that the underlying dynamics
is truly linear. In contrast, we consider the problem of identifying a
linearized model when the true underlying dynamics is nonlinear, given that
there is a certain constraint on the region where one can initialize the
experiments. We provide a multiple trajectories-based deterministic data
acquisition algorithm followed by a regularized least squares algorithm, and
provide a finite sample error bound on the learned linearized dynamics. Our
error bound shows that one can consistently learn the linearized dynamics, and
demonstrates a trade-off between the error due to nonlinearity and the error
due to noise. We validate our results through numerical experiments, where we
also show the potential insufficiency of linear system identification using a
single trajectory with i.i.d. random inputs, when nonlinearity does exist.

Result: JDI-CP实现有限样本1-2α覆盖保证；实验显示算法在合成与真实数据中均具鲁棒覆盖性和与基准相当的效率。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决污染数据下的共形预测问题，覆盖性能强且实用。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a powerful tool for constructing prediction intervals
for black-box models, providing a finite sample coverage guarantee for
exchangeable data. However, this exchangeability is compromised when some
entries of the test feature are contaminated, such as in the case of cellwise
outliers. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel framework called
detect-then-impute conformal prediction. This framework first employs an
outlier detection procedure on the test feature and then utilizes an imputation
method to fill in those cells identified as outliers. To quantify the
uncertainty in the processed test feature, we adaptively apply the detection
and imputation procedures to the calibration set, thereby constructing
exchangeable features for the conformal prediction interval of the test label.
We develop two practical algorithms, PDI-CP and JDI-CP, and provide a
distribution-free coverage analysis under some commonly used detection and
imputation procedures. Notably, JDI-CP achieves a finite sample $1-2\alpha$
coverage guarantee. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that our proposed algorithms exhibit robust coverage properties and
comparable efficiency to the oracle baseline.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, raises
a key question: how can synthetic data from these models enhance predictive
modeling? While they can generate vast amounts of datasets, only a subset
meaningfully improves performance. We propose a novel end-to-end framework that
generates and systematically filters synthetic data through domain-specific
statistical methods, selectively integrating high-quality samples for effective
augmentation. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in predictive
performance across various settings, highlighting the potential of our
framework while underscoring the inherent limitations of generative models for
data augmentation. Despite the ability to produce large volumes of synthetic
data, the proportion that effectively improves model performance is limited.

Abstract: The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on
observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test
for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is
whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical
across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text
similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated
using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from
an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated
using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We
showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic
asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting
strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a
unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example
demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type
one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The
proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document
classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is
crucial.

Motivation: 传统的拒绝学习基于边际分布，而该论文希望通过联合理想分布建立更优的拒绝机制，并探讨其与统计差异的联系。

Method: 通过联合理想分布（输入与标签）构建拒绝机制，并将其与Bhattacharyya分歧阈值化建立联系。

Result: 发现基于Bhattacharyya分歧的拒绝机制较传统的Chow规则（KL分歧）更温和。

Conclusion: 通过联合理想分布实现的拒绝机制为模型提供了一种更稳健的决策方式。

Abstract: Learning to reject provide a learning paradigm which allows for our models to
abstain from making predictions. One way to learn the rejector is to learn an
ideal marginal distribution (w.r.t. the input domain) - which characterizes a
hypothetical best marginal distribution - and compares it to the true marginal
distribution via a density ratio. In this paper, we consider learning a joint
ideal distribution over both inputs and labels; and develop a link between
rejection and thresholding different statistical divergences. We further find
that when one considers a variant of the log-loss, the rejector obtained by
considering the joint ideal distribution corresponds to the thresholding of the
skewed Bhattacharyya divergence between class-probabilities. This is in
contrast to the marginal case - that is equivalent to a typical
characterization of optimal rejection, Chow's Rule - which corresponds to a
thresholding of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In general, we find that
rejecting via a Bhattacharyya divergence is less aggressive than Chow's Rule.

Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant
framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the
macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant
models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations
in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by
combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors.
The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding
and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained
architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training
process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning
problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar
function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the
appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions
that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to
implement, and accurate in practical settings.

Result: 通过该方法可以更全面地评估Gen-RecSys，平衡个性化效果与风险控制。

Conclusion: 论文为Gen-RecSys的评估提供了框架，帮助研究者和实践者在确保责任性的同时提升推荐效果。

Abstract: Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond
classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously
unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these
systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and
multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown
territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private
information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these
challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or
alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation
challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are
exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new
risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we
propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments
and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias
detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so
researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring
effective personalization and responsible deployment.

Abstract: The Query-By-Document (QBD) problem is an information retrieval problem where
the query is a document, and the retrieved candidates are documents that match
the query document, often in a domain or query specific manner. This can be
crucial for tasks such as patent matching, legal or compliance case retrieval,
and academic literature review. Existing retrieval methods, including keyword
search and document embeddings, can be optimized with domain-specific datasets
to improve QBD search performance. However, creating these domain-specific
datasets is often costly and time-consuming. Our work introduces a process to
generate custom QBD-search datasets and compares a set of methods to use in
this problem, which we refer to as QBD-RankedDatagen. We provide a comparative
analysis of our proposed methods in terms of cost, speed, and the human
interface with the domain experts. The methods we compare leverage Large
Language Models (LLMs) which can incorporate domain expert input to produce
document scores and rankings, as well as explanations for human review. The
process and methods for it that we present can significantly reduce human
effort in dataset creation for custom domains while still obtaining sufficient
expert knowledge for tuning retrieval models. We evaluate our methods on QBD
datasets from the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and finetune the parameters
of the BM25 model -- which is used in many industrial-strength search engines
like OpenSearch -- using the generated data.

Abstract: The volume of scientific literature is growing exponentially, leading to
underutilized discoveries, duplicated efforts, and limited cross-disciplinary
collaboration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a way to assist
scientists by improving the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
processing this influx of information. However, scaling RAG to handle millions
of articles introduces significant challenges, including the high computational
costs associated with parsing documents and embedding scientific knowledge, as
well as the algorithmic complexity of aligning these representations with the
nuanced semantics of scientific content. To address these issues, we introduce
HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index
and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its
core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and
ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval
accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques.
HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering
benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90%
accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA-outperforming both domain-specific models
like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4. Scaling to thousands of GPUs
on the Polaris, Sunspot, and Frontier supercomputers, HiPerRAG delivers million
document-scale RAG workflows for unifying scientific knowledge and fostering
interdisciplinary innovation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合传统推荐模型和大语言模型（LLM）的混合框架，用于重新排序推荐结果，旨在解决LLM在推荐系统中存在的上下文窗口限制、位置偏差等问题。实验表明，尽管随机化用户历史数据提高了排序质量，但LLM重排序并未超越基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）在提示式推荐中展现了个性化输出的潜力，但其存在上下文窗口限制、低效的成对提示和难以处理列表排序等问题，特别是对位置偏差敏感。因此，研究提出结合传统推荐模型和LLM的混合框架，以优化推荐结果。

Method: 研究设计了一个混合框架，使用传统推荐模型生成初始推荐列表，然后通过LLM进行重排序。通过实验评估用户历史数据重新排序和指令提示对减轻位置偏差的效果。

Result: 在MovieLens-100K数据集上的实验显示，随机化用户历史数据提升了排序质量，但LLM重排序效果未超过基础模型，且显式减轻位置偏差的指令并未生效。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM在处理推荐系统排序上下文和缓解位置偏差方面存在局限性，需要进一步研究提升其性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content across
digital platforms by modeling user preferences and behaviors. Recently, large
language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to
their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training.
However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window
size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling
listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to
position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless
of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a
hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM
for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of
user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias.
Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves
ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model.
Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our
evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and
mitigate bias. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/aminul7506/LLMForReRanking.

Motivation: 动机：普通公众因法律知识的技术性和专业性难以有效检索信息，传统检索方法假设用户能提出精准查询，但实际存在巨大差距。

Method: 方法：提出QBR方法，利用问题库（QB）作为媒介，生成训练样本以增强文档知识单元的嵌入，实现高效的细粒度知识检索。

Result: 结果：实验表明QBR在准确性、效率、可解释性及结果理解上优于传统方法，并能辅助公民解决日常法律问题。

Conclusion: 结论：QBR通过问题库有效提升法律知识检索的可及性和实用性，具有显著的社会影响。

Abstract: Retrieval of legal knowledge by the general public is a challenging problem
due to the technicality of the professional knowledge and the lack of
fundamental understanding by laypersons on the subject. Traditional information
retrieval techniques assume that users are capable of formulating succinct and
precise queries for effective document retrieval. In practice, however, the
wide gap between the highly technical contents and untrained users makes legal
knowledge retrieval very difficult. We propose a methodology, called QBR, which
employs a Questions Bank (QB) as an effective medium for bridging the knowledge
gap. We show how the QB is used to derive training samples to enhance the
embedding of knowledge units within documents, which leads to effective
fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We discuss and evaluate through experiments
various advantages of QBR over traditional methods. These include more
accurate, efficient, and explainable document retrieval, better comprehension
of retrieval results, and highly effective fine-grained knowledge retrieval. We
also present some case studies and show that QBR achieves social impact by
assisting citizens to resolve everyday legal concerns.

Abstract: Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality
and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation
learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing
on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains
costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work
has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these
approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent
observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that
are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated
Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation
tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion
model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both
arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs
constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving
gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual
coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our
results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable
data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits
such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop
and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing
frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations,
highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we
introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs)
framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and
decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks
using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including
Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop
performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the
interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance
of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a
strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.

Abstract: The miniaturisation of sensors and processors, the advancements in connected
edge intelligence, and the exponential interest in Artificial Intelligence are
boosting the affirmation of autonomous nano-size drones in the Internet of
Robotic Things ecosystem. However, achieving safe autonomous navigation and
high-level tasks such as exploration and surveillance with these tiny platforms
is extremely challenging due to their limited resources. This work focuses on
enabling the safe and autonomous flight of a pocket-size, 30-gram platform
called Crazyflie 2.1 in a partially known environment. We propose a novel
AI-aided, vision-based reactive planning method for obstacle avoidance under
the ambit of Integrated Sensing, Computing and Communication paradigm. We deal
with the constraints of the nano-drone by splitting the navigation task into
two parts: a deep learning-based object detector runs on the edge (external
hardware) while the planning algorithm is executed onboard. The results show
the ability to command the drone at $\sim8$ frames-per-second and a model
performance reaching a COCO mean-average-precision of $60.8$. Field experiments
demonstrate the feasibility of the solution with the drone flying at a top
speed of $1$ m/s while steering away from an obstacle placed in an unknown
position and reaching the target destination. The outcome highlights the
compatibility of the communication delay and the model performance with the
requirements of the real-time navigation task. We provide a feasible
alternative to a fully onboard implementation that can be extended to
autonomous exploration with nano-drones.

Abstract: Training robots in simulation requires diverse 3D scenes that reflect the
specific challenges of downstream tasks. However, scenes that satisfy strict
task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial
arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate
large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic
environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We
do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts
which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3)
poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using
reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or
inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even
when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables
goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales
across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search
strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and
simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five
diverse environments. Website with videos, code, data, and model weights:

TL;DR: 论文提出CubeDAgger方法，通过改进EnsembleDAgger，增强交互模仿学习的鲁棒性和动态稳定性，减少专家监督负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互模仿学习算法通过专家-代理切换系统减少专家监督负担，但切换时机难以精确选择且会导致动作突变，损害动态稳定性。

Method: CubeDAgger对EnsembleDAgger进行三项改进：1) 显式激活监督时机的阈值正则化；2) 将切换系统转为多动作候选的最优共识系统；3) 引入自回归有色噪声以使随机探索时间一致。

Result: 仿真验证表明，学习到的策略在交互中既保持鲁棒性，又维持了动态稳定性。

Conclusion: CubeDAgger通过改进EnsembleDAgger，有效平衡了鲁棒性与动态稳定性，为交互模仿学习提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive imitation learning makes an agent's control policy robust by
stepwise supervisions from an expert. The recent algorithms mostly employ
expert-agent switching systems to reduce the expert's burden by limitedly
selecting the supervision timing. However, the precise selection is difficult
and such a switching causes abrupt changes in actions, damaging the dynamic
stability. This paper therefore proposes a novel method, so-called CubeDAgger,
which improves robustness while reducing dynamic stability violations by making
three improvements to a baseline method, EnsembleDAgger. The first improvement
adds a regularization to explicitly activate the threshold for deciding the
supervision timing. The second transforms the expert-agent switching system to
an optimal consensus system of multiple action candidates. Third,
autoregressive colored noise to the actions is introduced to make the
stochastic exploration consistent over time. These improvements are verified by
simulations, showing that the learned policies are sufficiently robust while
maintaining dynamic stability during interaction.

Motivation: 模仿学习需要大量带动作标签的专家示范，成本高昂且限制了训练数据的规模。论文希望通过无标记观测数据（如视频示范）学习潜在动作标签，降低数据需求。

Method: 论文设计了连续潜在动作模型（CLAM），采用连续潜在动作标签而非离散表示，并联合训练动作解码器，确保潜在动作空间能轻松映射到真实动作。

Result: 在DMControl（运动）和MetaWorld（操作）基准测试以及真实WidowX机器人上，CLAM显著优于现有方法，任务成功率提升2-3倍。

Conclusion: CLAM通过无监督学习潜在动作标签，显著减少了对带标签专家数据的依赖，在复杂连续控制任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning robot policies using imitation learning requires collecting large
amounts of costly action-labeled expert demonstrations, which fundamentally
limits the scale of training data. A promising approach to address this
bottleneck is to harness the abundance of unlabeled observations-e.g., from
video demonstrations-to learn latent action labels in an unsupervised way.
However, we find that existing methods struggle when applied to complex robot
tasks requiring fine-grained motions. We design continuous latent action models
(CLAM) which incorporate two key ingredients we find necessary for learning to
solve complex continuous control tasks from unlabeled observation data: (a)
using continuous latent action labels instead of discrete representations, and
(b) jointly training an action decoder to ensure that the latent action space
can be easily grounded to real actions with relatively few labeled examples.
Importantly, the labeled examples can be collected from non-optimal play data,
enabling CLAM to learn performant policies without access to any action-labeled
expert data. We demonstrate on continuous control benchmarks in DMControl
(locomotion) and MetaWorld (manipulation), as well as on a real WidowX robot
arm that CLAM significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods,
remarkably with a 2-3x improvement in task success rate compared to the best
baseline. Videos and code can be found at clamrobot.github.io.

Abstract: Human drivers exhibit individual preferences regarding driving style.
Adapting autonomous vehicles to these preferences is essential for user trust
and satisfaction. However, existing end-to-end driving approaches often rely on
predefined driving styles or require continuous user feedback for adaptation,
limiting their ability to support dynamic, context-dependent preferences. We
propose a novel approach using multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
with preference-driven optimization for end-to-end autonomous driving that
enables runtime adaptation to driving style preferences. Preferences are
encoded as continuous weight vectors to modulate behavior along interpretable
style objectives$\unicode{x2013}$including efficiency, comfort, speed, and
aggressiveness$\unicode{x2013}$without requiring policy retraining. Our
single-policy agent integrates vision-based perception in complex mixed-traffic
scenarios and is evaluated in diverse urban environments using the CARLA
simulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent dynamically adapts
its driving behavior according to changing preferences while maintaining
performance in terms of collision avoidance and route completion.

Abstract: Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation
skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands.
Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit
this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor
a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute
ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce
SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for
ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral
symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation
tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By
exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from
one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the
subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the
hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated
manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of
them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the
left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's
scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our
symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and
coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias
in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization
across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法缺乏对编码器和解码器同时优化的关注，且随机剪枝效率较低。本研究旨在通过进化计算和激活信息指导的剪枝算子，提升剪枝效率和模型性能，并探讨不同剪枝环境下的适用性。

Method: 提出了两种基于激活信息的剪枝算子，分别在传统自编码器和协同进化框架下进行实验。通过对比随机剪枝和激活指导剪枝的效果，以及不同剪枝策略的组合，评估方法的有效性。

Result: 在传统自编码器中，激活指导的剪枝优于随机剪枝，剪枝后模型性能与完整模型相当；但在协同进化框架下，随机剪枝表现更好，因为其更高的维度扩展了剪枝的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 激活信息指导的剪枝在低维环境下更有效，而协同进化框架下随机剪枝更具优势。未来可结合两种策略，优化不同场景的剪枝效果。

Abstract: This study explores a novel approach to neural network pruning using
evolutionary computation, focusing on simultaneously pruning the encoder and
decoder of an autoencoder. We introduce two new mutation operators that use
layer activations to guide weight pruning. Our findings reveal that one of
these activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in
more efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained
models. Prior work has established that autoencoder training is effective and
scalable with a spatial coevolutionary algorithm that cooperatively coevolves a
population of encoders with a population of decoders, rather than one
autoencoder. We evaluate how the same activity-guided mutation operators
transfer to this context. We find that random pruning is better than guided
pruning, in the coevolutionary setting. This suggests activation-based guidance
proves more effective in low-dimensional pruning environments, where
constrained sample spaces can lead to deviations from true uniformity in
randomization. Conversely, population-driven strategies enhance robustness by
expanding the total pruning dimensionality, achieving statistically uniform
randomness that better preserves system dynamics. We experiment with pruning
according to different schedules and present best combinations of operator and
schedule for the canonical and coevolving populations cases.

Abstract: Our study presents PNN-UNet as a method for constructing deep neural networks

Wide-UNet as the nerve cords, with a densely connected autoencoder performing
the role of the brain. This distinct architecture offers advantages over both
monolithic (UNet) and modular networks (Ensemble-UNet). Our outcomes on a 3D
MRI hippocampus dataset, with and without data augmentation, demonstrate that
PNN-UNet outperforms the baseline UNet and several other UNet variants in image
segmentation.

Abstract: The computational imaging technique of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM)
enables high-resolution imaging with a wide field of view and can serve as an
extremely valuable tool, e.g. in the classification of cells in medical
applications. However, reconstructing a high-resolution image from tens or even
hundreds of measurements is computationally expensive, particularly for a wide
field of view. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the idea of classifying
the image content in the FPM measurements directly without performing a
reconstruction step first. We show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can
extract meaningful information from measurement sequences, significantly
outperforming the classification on a single band-limited image (up to 12 %)
while being significantly more efficient than a reconstruction of a
high-resolution image. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a learned multiplexing
of several raw measurements allows maintaining the classification accuracy
while reducing the amount of data (and consequently also the acquisition time)
significantly.

Motivation: 探索自监督学习预训练的ViTs在视网膜图像领域的表现，尤其是自然图像预训练与领域特定预训练的效果对比，以验证是否必须进行领域内预训练。

Method: 对比了六种SSL预训练的ViTs在七个数字眼底图像数据集（共70,000张标注图像）上的表现，任务为中度至晚期年龄相关性黄斑变性（AMD）识别。

Result: 自然图像预训练的iBOT表现最佳（AUROC 0.80-0.97），优于领域特定模型（AUROC 0.78-0.96）和未预训练的基线ViT-L（AUROC 0.68-0.91）。

Conclusion: 自然图像预训练的模型在AMD识别中表现优异，挑战了领域内预训练的必要性。作者还发布了BRAMD数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has enabled Vision Transformers (ViTs) to
learn robust representations from large-scale natural image datasets, enhancing
their generalization across domains. In retinal imaging, foundation models
pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the
benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we
benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets
totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that
iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution
generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining,
which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of
foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption
that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an
open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.

Abstract: Regression-based predictive analytics used in modern kidney transplantation
is known to inherit biases from training data. This leads to social
discrimination and inefficient organ utilization, particularly in the context
of a few social groups. Despite this concern, there is limited research on
fairness in regression and its impact on organ utilization and placement. This
paper introduces three novel divergence-based group fairness notions: (i)
independence, (ii) separation, and (iii) sufficiency to assess the fairness of
regression-based analytics tools. In addition, fairness preferences are
investigated from crowd feedback, in order to identify a socially accepted
group fairness criterion for evaluating these tools. A total of 85 participants
were recruited from the Prolific crowdsourcing platform, and a Mixed-Logit
discrete choice model was used to model fairness feedback and estimate social
fairness preferences. The findings clearly depict a strong preference towards
the separation and sufficiency fairness notions, and that the predictive
analytics is deemed fair with respect to gender and race groups, but unfair in
terms of age groups.

TL;DR: 本文研究了人工神经网络（ANNs）中的‘虚构’现象，尤其在储备池计算机（RCs）中表现为‘未训练吸引子’（UA），探讨了UA在动力学重建失败中的作用，并指出这种虚构可能是学习系统的内在特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工神经网络取得了显著进展，但其学习机制和虚构现象（如无意识生成错误信息）仍不清楚。本文旨在通过分析储备池计算机（RCs）中的未训练吸引子（UA），揭示虚构现象的根源及其对系统动力学的影响。

Method: 研究通过分析RCs的动力学系统，重点关注其在训练过程中生成未训练吸引子（UA）的行为，探讨UA在重建失败中的作用及其对吸引子转换的影响。

Result: 研究发现UA是状态空间受限的学习系统的固有特征，且这种虚构现象可能不仅限于RCs，也可能存在于其他系统中。

Conclusion: 未训练吸引子（UA）是学习系统固有的虚构形式，其存在对理解人工神经网络的学习和失败机制具有重要意义，且可能普遍存在于各类学习系统中。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to
innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs).
Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how
elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information
without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To
provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation
occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN.
RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a
well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given
attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to
construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on
the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when
modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results,
we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state
spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in
systems beyond RCs.

Motivation: 传递算子和Koopman算子能通过线性变换描述复杂非线性动力系统，但如何从数据中高效估计其谱特性是一个挑战。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用机器学习和表示学习，训练正交且局部支持的基函数，使其动态适应系统特性，从而逼近线性算子的作用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能准确逼近算子的作用，并生成几乎不变的有限维子空间，有效恢复谱特性。

Conclusion: 学习到的动态自适应基函数为非线性动力系统的线性表征提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing
complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling for a
deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectrum of these
operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent
behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging.
We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational
learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient
finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal,
locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system.
This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the
operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We
illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral
properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive
quality of the machine-learned basis.

Conclusion: 该量子启发式框架通过结合经典可扩展优化方法，为医疗和AI等领域的数据填充任务提供了一种鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data imputation is a critical step in data pre-processing, particularly for
datasets with missing or unreliable values. This study introduces a novel
quantum-inspired imputation framework evaluated on the UCI Diabetes dataset,
which contains biologically implausible missing values across several clinical
features. The method integrates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with
quantum-assisted rotations, optimized through gradient-free classical
optimizers -COBYLA, Simulated Annealing, and Differential Evolution to
reconstruct missing values while preserving statistical fidelity. Reconstructed
values are constrained within +/-2 standard deviations of original feature
distributions, avoiding unrealistic clustering around central tendencies. This
approach achieves a substantial and statistically significant improvement,
including an average reduction of over 85% in Wasserstein distance and
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-values between 0.18 and 0.22, compared to p-values >
0.99 in classical methods such as Mean, KNN, and MICE. The method also
eliminates zero-value artifacts and enhances the realism and variability of
imputed data. By combining quantum-inspired transformations with a scalable
classical framework, this methodology provides a robust solution for imputation
tasks in domains such as healthcare and AI pipelines, where data quality and
integrity are crucial.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages over classical computing for
specific tasks, yet the boundary of practical quantum advantage remains an open
question. To investigate this boundary, it is crucial to understand whether,
and how, classical machines can learn and simulate quantum algorithms. Recent
progress in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated strong reasoning
abilities, prompting exploration into their potential for this challenge. In
this work, we introduce GroverGPT-2, an LLM-based method for simulating
Grover's algorithm using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and quantum-native
tokenization. Building on its predecessor, GroverGPT-2 performs simulation
directly from quantum circuit representations while producing logically
structured and interpretable outputs. Our results show that GroverGPT-2 can
learn and internalize quantum circuit logic through efficient processing of
quantum-native tokens, providing direct evidence that classical models like
LLMs can capture the structure of quantum algorithms. Furthermore, GroverGPT-2
outputs interleave circuit data with natural language, embedding explicit
reasoning into the simulation. This dual capability positions GroverGPT-2 as a
prototype for advancing machine understanding of quantum algorithms and
modeling quantum circuit logic. We also identify an empirical scaling law for
GroverGPT-2 with increasing qubit numbers, suggesting a path toward scalable
classical simulation. These findings open new directions for exploring the
limits of classical simulatability, enhancing quantum education and research,
and laying groundwork for future foundation models in quantum computing.

Abstract: This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome
classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously
prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension
transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit
worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data
dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through
diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving
posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of
posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the
joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for
quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit
using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable
classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution
learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise,
eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate
the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions
compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new
theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage
in joint distribution learning.

Conclusion: 提出的量子算法在非凸势能采样中具有显著的理论优势，为未来量子计算在采样问题中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Sampling from probability distributions of the form $\sigma \propto e^{-\beta
V}$, where $V$ is a continuous potential, is a fundamental task across physics,
chemistry, biology, computer science, and statistics. However, when $V$ is
non-convex, the resulting distribution becomes non-logconcave, and classical
methods such as Langevin dynamics often exhibit poor performance. We introduce
the first quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of
continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes
the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as
the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten
Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value
thresholding and yields the first provable quantum advantage with respect to
the Poincar\'e constant in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this
framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates
replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from
complex, rugged energy landscapes.

Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems
evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and
bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of
matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space
$\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights
that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not
require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie
groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a
global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error
signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free
configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established
using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation
control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.

Abstract: With the high penetration of renewables, traditional model-based power system
operation is challenged to deliver economic, stable, and robust decisions.
Machine learning has emerged as a powerful modeling tool for capturing complex
dynamics to address these challenges. However, its separate design often lacks
systematic integration with existing methods. To fill the gap, this paper
proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations
(LAPSO, pronounced as Lap-So). Adopting a native optimization perspective,
LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to break the boundary between
temporally siloed power system tasks, such as forecast, operation and control,
while unifying the objectives of machine learning and model-based optimizations
at both training and inference stages. Systematic analysis and simulations
demonstrate the effectiveness of applying LAPSO in designing new integrated
algorithms, such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and
objective-based forecasting (OBF), while enabling end-to-end tracing of
different sources of uncertainties. In addition, a dedicated Python
package-lapso is introduced to automatically augment existing power system
optimization models with learnable components. All code and data are available

Abstract: The emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has
enabled more advanced chatbots capable of human-like interactions. However,
these conversational agents introduce a broader set of operational risks that
extend beyond traditional cybersecurity considerations. In this work, we
propose a novel, instrumented risk-assessment metric that simultaneously
evaluates potential threats to three key stakeholders: the service-providing
organization, end users, and third parties. Our approach incorporates the
technical complexity required to induce erroneous behaviors in the
chatbot--ranging from non-induced failures to advanced prompt-injection
attacks--as well as contextual factors such as the target industry, user age
range, and vulnerability severity. To validate our metric, we leverage Garak,
an open-source framework for LLM vulnerability testing. We further enhance
Garak to capture a variety of threat vectors (e.g., misinformation, code
hallucinations, social engineering, and malicious code generation). Our
methodology is demonstrated in a scenario involving chatbots that employ
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), showing how the aggregated risk scores
guide both short-term mitigation and longer-term improvements in model design
and deployment. The results underscore the importance of multi-dimensional risk
assessments in operationalizing secure, reliable AI-driven conversational
systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into consumer and
enterprise applications. Despite their capabilities, they remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks that override
alignment safeguards. This paper provides a systematic investigation of
jailbreak strategies against various state-of-the-art LLMs. We categorize over
1,400 adversarial prompts, analyze their success against GPT-4, Claude 2,
Mistral 7B, and Vicuna, and examine their generalizability and construction
logic. We further propose layered mitigation strategies and recommend a hybrid
red-teaming and sandboxing approach for robust LLM security.

### [212] [ChainMarks: Securing DNN Watermark with Cryptographic Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04977)
*Brian Choi,Shu Wang,Isabelle Choi,Kun Sun*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ChainMarks是一种安全的DNN水印方案，通过引入密码链生成触发器输入，并采用两阶段蒙特卡洛方法确定水印存在，比现有方案更安全、更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护DNN模型的知识产权，现有水印方案易受攻击且判断标准模糊，需要更安全的解决方案。

Method: 生成基于哈希函数和数字签名的触发器输入，结合原始数据集训练模型，通过分类概率比较验证水印。

Result: ChainMarks在鲁棒性和安全性上优于现有方案，提供更高的水印存在概率保证。

Conclusion: ChainMarks为DNN模型所有者提供了更安全、更可靠的水印保护方案。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic
watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of
model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking
schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the
vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the
likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking
scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by
introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a
two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,
ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly
applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated
with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.
Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the
original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted
labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a
more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability
of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher
levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking
schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher
probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level
of watermark accuracy.

Abstract: Hypergraphs, capable of representing high-order interactions via hyperedges,
have become a powerful tool for modeling real-world biological and social
systems. Inherent relationships within these real-world systems, such as the
encoding relationship between genes and their protein products, drive the
establishment of interconnections between multiple hypergraphs. Here, we
demonstrate how to utilize those interconnections between multiple hypergraphs
to synthesize integrated information from multiple higher-order systems,
thereby enhancing understanding of underlying structures. We propose a model
based on the stochastic block model, which integrates information from multiple
hypergraphs to reveal latent high-order structures. Real-world hyperedges
exhibit preferential attachment, where certain nodes dominate hyperedge
formation. To characterize this phenomenon, our model introduces hyperedge
internal degree to quantify nodes' contributions to hyperedge formation. This
model is capable of mining communities, predicting missing hyperedges of
arbitrary sizes within hypergraphs, and inferring inter-hypergraph edges
between hypergraphs. We apply our model to high-order datasets to evaluate its
performance. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of our model
in community detection, hyperedge prediction, and inter-hypergraph edge
prediction tasks. Moreover, we show that our model enables analysis of multiple
hypergraphs of different types and supports the analysis of a single hypergraph
in the absence of inter-hypergraph edges. Our work provides a practical and
flexible tool for analyzing multiple hypergraphs, greatly advancing the
understanding of the organization in real-world high-order systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化评估深度学习PDE求解器在期权定价中的实际应用效果，填补其经验性和定量准确性研究的空白。

Method: 在Black-Scholes和Heston模型中进行对比实验，分析采样阶段数、样本量、网络层数、每层节点数（TDGF还包括离散化方案阶数和时间步数）对Deep Galerkin Method和TDGF方法性能的影响。

Result: 实证验证了两种方法的收敛率和训练时间随参数变化的规律。

Conclusion: 研究为深度学习PDE求解器在期权定价中的实际应用提供了参考依据。

Abstract: Option pricing often requires solving partial differential equations (PDEs).
Although deep learning-based PDE solvers have recently emerged as quick
solutions to this problem, their empirical and quantitative accuracy remain not
well understood, hindering their real-world applicability. In this research,
our aim is to offer actionable insights into the utility of deep PDE solvers
for practical option pricing implementation. Through comparative experiments in
both the Black--Scholes and the Heston model, we assess the empirical
performance of two neural network algorithms to solve PDEs: the Deep Galerkin
Method and the Time Deep Gradient Flow method (TDGF). We determine their
empirical convergence rates and training time as functions of (i) the number of
sampling stages, (ii) the number of samples, (iii) the number of layers, and
(iv) the number of nodes per layer. For the TDGF, we also consider the order of
the discretization scheme and the number of time steps.

Abstract: This work presents an open-source unified benchmarking and evaluation
framework for text-to-image generation models, with a particular focus on the
impact of metadata augmented prompts. Leveraging the DeepFashion-MultiModal
dataset, we assess generated outputs through a comprehensive set of
quantitative metrics, including Weighted Score, CLIP (Contrastive Language
Image Pre-training)-based similarity, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch

well as qualitative analysis. Our results demonstrate that structured metadata
enrichments greatly enhance visual realism, semantic fidelity, and model
robustness across diverse text-to-image architectures. While not a traditional

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉任务中表现出色，但其内部行为（尤其是不同层和激活通道对类可分性的贡献）仍难以理解。因此需要直观的工具来分析这些激活。

Method: 提出ChannelExplorer工具，提供三种主要视图（散点图、Jaccard相似性视图和热力图），支持CNN、GAN、ResNet和Stable Diffusion等模型架构的分析。

Result: 通过四种用例（如ImageNet类层次生成、错误标注图像识别等）验证工具能力，并得到专家的正面评价。

Conclusion: ChannelExplorer为模型行为分析提供了数据驱动的可视化方法，增强了深度神经网络的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in many
vision tasks, yet understanding their internal behavior remains challenging,
particularly how different layers and activation channels contribute to class
separability. We introduce ChannelExplorer, an interactive visual analytics
tool for analyzing image-based outputs across model layers, emphasizing
data-driven insights over architecture analysis for exploring class
separability. ChannelExplorer summarizes activations across layers and
visualizes them using three primary coordinated views: a Scatterplot View to
reveal inter- and intra-class confusion, a Jaccard Similarity View to quantify
activation overlap, and a Heatmap View to inspect activation channel patterns.
Our technique supports diverse model architectures, including CNNs, GANs,
ResNet and Stable Diffusion models. We demonstrate the capabilities of
ChannelExplorer through four use-case scenarios: (1) generating class hierarchy
in ImageNet, (2) finding mislabeled images, (3) identifying activation channel
contributions, and(4) locating latent states' position in Stable Diffusion
model. Finally, we evaluate the tool with expert users.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous
optimization of multiple terms, are prevalent across numerous applications.
Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually tuned
aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization target. The performance
of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a
time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the
setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically
simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically
used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain
expertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability
of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we
present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is
broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems,
including motion tracking. The proposed adversarial differential discriminator
receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the
optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters
to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving
comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying
on manually tuned reward functions. Results are best visualized through

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于单目连续波飞行时间(C-ToF)相机的动态场景重建方法，通过原始传感器样本实现与神经体积方法相似或更高的精度，且速度快100倍。该方法针对深度信息非直接测量的挑战，优化了3D高斯散射表示，并通过两种启发式方法提升了几何精度。实验表明，该方法在受限C-ToF传感条件下（如快速挥棒动作）仍能实现精确重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算机视觉中，从单一视角快速实现高保真动态3D重建是一大挑战。C-ToF辐射场重建中，深度信息并非直接测量，这为优化带来了额外困难。这一问题在使用快速基元表示（如3D高斯散射）时尤为显著，通常需多视角数据才能获得满意结果，否则优化过程易失效。

Method: 通过将两种启发式方法融入优化过程，提升了高斯表示的几何精度。针对C-ToF原始传感器样本，利用改进的3D高斯散射技术进行动态场景重建。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在受限C-ToF条件下（包括快速运动场景如挥棒动作）实现了高精度重建，且速度比神经体积方法快100倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化高斯表示和融入启发式策略，显著提升了单目C-ToF动态重建的精度与效率，为快速运动场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present a method to reconstruct dynamic scenes from monocular
continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras using raw sensor samples that
achieves similar or better accuracy than neural volumetric approaches and is
100x faster. Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a
single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF
radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly
measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and
underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based
scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with
multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its
optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to
improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians. Experimental
results show that our approach produces accurate reconstructions under
constrained C-ToF sensing conditions, including for fast motions like swinging
baseball bats. https://visual.cs.brown.edu/gftorf

Abstract: The medical device industry has significantly advanced by integrating
sophisticated electronics like microchips and field-programmable gate arrays

staplers,a class 2 medical device. Historically considered low-risk, these
devices have recently been linked to an increasing number of injuries and
fatalities. The study evaluates the performance and data requirements of these
machine-learning approaches, highlighting their potential to enhance device

Method: 使用RobustSleepNet进行睡眠分期，SUMOv2检测纺锤波，对比双相情感障碍患者与健康对照组。

Conclusion: 全自动化方法有望推动大规模睡眠研究，作者公开了代码并推出隐私保护平台SomnoBot。

Abstract: Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages)
and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable
large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater
incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle
detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating
multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully
automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep
staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can
replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The
automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based
study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between
bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously
took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis
differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases
between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually
performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle
detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the
potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public
access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and
introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.

Abstract: The article explores the emerging domain of incentive-aware machine learning

actions lead to genuine personal or societal improvement. The paper introduces
a unified framework encapsulating models for these perspectives, including
