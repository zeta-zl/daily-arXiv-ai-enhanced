This research investigates the use of\nauthorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a\nmeans to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting\ntransparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior\nwork, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and\nexpansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three\ndatasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of\nMelbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include\nLLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from\n506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology\nto construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture\nmeaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's\neffectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing\nbetween student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against\nLLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the\nenhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and\nmeasure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing\neducators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations.\nThis work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the\ndynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era."}

This suggests that contextual\nentrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the\nrelevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the\nsentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of\ncontextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual\nprompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while\ncontextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic\nfactors.\n  We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads -- the entrainment\nheads -- that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon.

Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately\ncapture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook\nthe complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce\nWorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity\n(GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our\napproach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al.,\nwhich distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural\nhomogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives.\nWorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative\nperspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional\ncategorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two\nintervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where\nsystem prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System\n(MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing\ndistinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results\ndemonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS)\nentropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs,\nalongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural\nbalance. These findings highlight the potential of multiplex-aware AI\nevaluation in mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, paving the way for more\ninclusive and ethically aligned AI systems."}

To overcome this\nlimitation, it is necessary to predict LLM inference times and apply a shortest\njob first scheduling strategy.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference.

The ResUNet++ model,\npreviously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline,\nparticularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance\non lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW)\ndata instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance\ndegradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection\npipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5%\nof the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more\ndata becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results\nmark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay\nthe groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities."}

To bridge this gap,\nthis paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for\nquantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30\nstate-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework\ncombines public API performance data with region-specific environmental\nmultipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We\nadditionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank\nmodels by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3\nand DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33\nWh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and\nthat Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short\nGPT-4o query consumes 0.43 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results\nin substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use\ncomparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual\ndrinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a\nChicago-sized forest to offset.

By utilizing multi-sample\nfeedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized\nevaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a\npreference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both\ncomprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios\nspan various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of\ninstruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios,\nachieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy\nfrom 55.1$\\%$ to 91.5$\\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a\nmargin of 83$\\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each\ncomponent of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at\nhttps://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted."}

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from\ndemonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training\nbecomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy\nperformance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods\ntypically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding\nhistorical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the\nretention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in\nimitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion\npolicies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture\nessential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we\nintroduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy\nlearns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization\nsignificantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal\nreliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further\nintroduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with\nshort contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context\nembeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing\nmemory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a\nself-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and\nselect candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments\nacross four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and\naccelerates policy training by more than 10x."}

However, while these policies\nachieve strong mean performance across a variety of tasks, they often\nunderperform on individual, specialized tasks and require further tuning on\nnewly acquired task-specific data. Combining task-specific data with carefully\ncurated subsets of large prior datasets via co-training can produce better\nspecialized policies, but selecting data naively may actually harm downstream\nperformance. To address this, we introduce DataMIL, a policy-driven data\nselection framework built on the datamodels paradigm that reasons about data\nselection in an end-to-end manner, using the policy itself to identify which\ndata points will most improve performance. Unlike standard practices that\nfilter data using human notions of quality (e.g., based on semantic or visual\nsimilarity), DataMIL directly optimizes data selection for task success,\nallowing us to select data that enhance the policy while dropping data that\ndegrade it. To avoid performing expensive rollouts in the environment during\nselection, we use a novel surrogate loss function on task-specific data,\nallowing us to use DataMIL in the real world without degrading performance. We\nvalidate our approach on a suite of more than 60 simulation and real-world\nmanipulation tasks - most notably showing successful data selection from the\nOpen X-Embodiment datasets-demonstrating consistent gains in success rates and\nsuperior performance over multiple baselines. Our results underscore the\nimportance of end-to-end, performance-aware data selection for unlocking the\npotential of large prior datasets in robotics.

Nearest neighbor (NN)\nmethods are widely used in missing data problems across multiple disciplines\nsuch as in recommender systems and for performing counterfactual inference in\npanel data settings. Prior works have shown that in addition to being very\nintuitive and easy to implement, NN methods enjoy nice theoretical guarantees.\nHowever, the performance of majority of the NN methods rely on the appropriate\nchoice of the radii and the weights assigned to each member in the nearest\nneighbor set and despite several works on nearest neighbor methods in the past\ntwo decades, there does not exist a systematic approach of choosing the radii\nand the weights without relying on methods like cross-validation. AWNN\naddresses this challenge by judiciously balancing the bias variance trade off\ninherent in weighted nearest-neighbor regression. We provide theoretical\nguarantees for the proposed method under minimal assumptions and support the\ntheory via synthetic experiments."}
