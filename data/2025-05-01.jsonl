One approach to this question is to\ncompare the cognitive dynamics of humans and large language models (LLMs).\nHowever, such a comparison requires a method to quantitatively analyze AI\ncognitive behavior under controlled conditions. While anecdotal observations\nsuggest that certain prompts can dramatically change LLM behavior, these\nobservations have remained largely qualitative. Here, we propose a two-part\nframework to investigate this phenomenon: a Transition-Inducing Prompt (TIP)\nthat triggers a rapid shift in LLM responsiveness, and a Transition Quantifying\nPrompt (TQP) that evaluates this change using a separate LLM. Through\ncontrolled experiments, we examined how LLMs react to prompts embedding two\nsemantically distant concepts (e.g., mathematical aperiodicity and traditional\ncrafts)--either fused together or presented separately--by changing their\nlinguistic quality and affective tone. Whereas humans tend to experience\nheightened engagement when such concepts are meaningfully blended producing a\nnovel concept--a form of conceptual fusion--current LLMs showed no significant\ndifference in responsiveness between semantically fused and non-fused prompts.\nThis suggests that LLMs may not yet replicate the conceptual integration\nprocesses seen in human intuition. Our method enables fine-grained,\nreproducible measurement of cognitive responsiveness, and may help illuminate\nkey differences in how intuition and conceptual leaps emerge in artificial\nversus human minds."}

Recent studies have introduced prompt learning to adapt\nvision-language models (VLMs) in FedDG by learning a single global prompt.\nHowever, such a one-prompt-fits-all learning paradigm typically leads to\nperformance degradation on personalized samples. Although the mixture of\nexperts (MoE) offers a promising solution for specialization, existing\nMoE-based methods suffer from coarse image-level expert assignment and high\ncommunication costs from parameterized routers. To address these limitations,\nwe propose TRIP, a Token-level prompt mixture with parameter-free routing\nframework for FedDG, which treats multiple prompts as distinct experts. Unlike\nexisting image-level routing designs, TRIP assigns different tokens within an\nimage to specific experts. To ensure communication efficiency, TRIP\nincorporates a parameter-free routing mechanism based on token clustering and\noptimal transport. The instance-specific prompt is then synthesized by\naggregating experts, weighted by the number of tokens assigned to each.\nAdditionally, TRIP develops an unbiased learning strategy for prompt experts,\nleveraging the VLM's zero-shot generalization capability.

Therefore, these local models can be\nproperly aggregated as a global model without undermining the overall\nperformance. Nevertheless, when the neighbor distribution patterns of nodes\nvary across different clients (e.g., when clients hold graphs with different\nlevels of heterophily), their local models may gain different and even conflict\nknowledge from their node-level predictive tasks.

Despite efforts to\ncombat this illicit trade, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier\nto sell wildlife products, putting new pressure on wild populations of\nendangered and threatened species. The use of these platforms also opens a new\nopportunity: as criminals sell wildlife products online, they leave digital\ntraces of their activity that can provide insights into trafficking activities\nas well as how they can be disrupted. The challenge lies in finding these\ntraces. Online marketplaces publish ads for a plethora of products, and\nidentifying ads for wildlife-related products is like finding a needle in a\nhaystack.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack method that leverages the\nprefilling feature of LLMs, a feature designed to enhance model output\nconstraints. Unlike traditional jailbreak methods, the proposed attack\ncircumvents LLMs' safety mechanisms by directly manipulating the probability\ndistribution of subsequent tokens, thereby exerting control over the model's\noutput. We propose two attack variants: Static Prefilling (SP), which employs a\nuniversal prefill text, and Optimized Prefilling (OP), which iteratively\noptimizes the prefill text to maximize the attack success rate. Experiments on\nsix state-of-the-art LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark validate the\neffectiveness of our method and demonstrate its capability to substantially\nenhance attack success rates when combined with existing jailbreak approaches.\nThe OP method achieved attack success rates of up to 99.82% on certain models,\nsignificantly outperforming baseline methods.

Many of the\navailable solutions for imbalanced regression adapt techniques from the class\nimbalance domain, such as linear interpolation and the addition of Gaussian\nnoise, to create synthetic data in sparse regions. However, in many cases, the\nunderlying distribution of the data is complex and non-linear. Consequently,\nthese approaches generate synthetic samples that do not accurately represent\nthe true feature-target relationship. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nSMOGAN, a two-step oversampling framework for imbalanced regression.

Despite efforts to\ncombat this illicit trade, the rise of e-commerce platforms has made it easier\nto sell wildlife products, putting new pressure on wild populations of\nendangered and threatened species. The use of these platforms also opens a new\nopportunity: as criminals sell wildlife products online, they leave digital\ntraces of their activity that can provide insights into trafficking activities\nas well as how they can be disrupted. The challenge lies in finding these\ntraces. Online marketplaces publish ads for a plethora of products, and\nidentifying ads for wildlife-related products is like finding a needle in a\nhaystack. Learning classifiers can automate ad identification, but creating\nthem requires costly, time-consuming data labeling that hinders support for\ndiverse ads and research questions. This paper addresses a critical challenge\nin the data science pipeline for wildlife trafficking analytics: generating\nquality labeled data for classifiers that select relevant data. While large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can directly label advertisements, doing so at scale is\nprohibitively expensive. We propose a cost-effective strategy that leverages\nLLMs to generate pseudo labels for a small sample of the data and uses these\nlabels to create specialized classification models. Our novel method\nautomatically gathers diverse and representative samples to be labeled while\nminimizing the labeling costs. Our experimental evaluation shows that our\nclassifiers achieve up to 95% F1 score, outperforming LLMs at a lower cost. We\npresent real use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in\nenabling analyses of different aspects of wildlife trafficking."}

Then, we performed\nclustering using the coordinates of the original data in the orthogonal\nsubspace as clustering targets. Finally, we obtained biclustering results of\nthe original dataset. Since dimensionality reduction was applied before\nclustering, the proposed algorithm effectively mitigated the data sparsity\nproblem caused by high dimensionality. Additionally, we applied this\nbiclustering algorithm to stock technical indicator combinations and stock\nprice trend prediction. Biclustering results were transformed into fuzzy rules,\nand we incorporated profit-preserving and stop-loss rules into the rule set,\nultimately forming a fuzzy inference system for stock price trend predictions\nand trading signals. To evaluate the performance of BCBOF, we compared it with\nexisting biclustering methods using multiple evaluation metrics. The results\nshowed that our algorithm outperformed other biclustering techniques. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the fuzzy inference system, we conducted virtual\ntrading experiments using historical data from 10 A-share stocks. The\nexperimental results showed that the generated trading strategies yielded\nhigher returns for investors."}

The main\nhypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto\nscale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the\ndistributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the\n$L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets\nlarge. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling\nof the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of\nthe angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to\nAitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a\nWasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new\nvalues. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives\nsimulated values on the original data scale.

As an applicative use case, we focused on\nclassifying common dementia conditions, Alzheimer's and frontotemporal\ndementia, versus controls. xEEGNet is broadly applicable to other neurological\nconditions involving spectral alterations. We initially used ShallowNet, a\nsimple and popular model from the EEGNet-family. Its structure was analyzed and\ngradually modified to move from a \"black box\" to a more transparent model,\nwithout compromising performance. The learned kernels and weights were examined\nfrom a clinical standpoint to assess medical relevance. Model variants,\nincluding ShallowNet and the final xEEGNet, were evaluated using robust\nNested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out cross-validation for unbiased performance\nestimates. Variability across data splits was explained using embedded EEG\nrepresentations, grouped by class and set, with pairwise separability to\nquantify group distinction. Overfitting was assessed through\ntraining-validation loss correlation and training speed. xEEGNet uses only 168\nparameters, 200 times fewer than ShallowNet, yet retains interpretability,\nresists overfitting, achieves comparable median performance (-1.5%), and\nreduces variability across splits. This variability is explained by embedded\nEEG representations: higher accuracy correlates with greater separation between\ntest set controls and Alzheimer's cases, without significant influence from\ntraining data. xEEGNet's ability to filter specific EEG bands, learn\nband-specific topographies, and use relevant spectral features demonstrates its\ninterpretability. While large deep learning models are often prioritized for\nperformance, this study shows smaller architectures like xEEGNet can be equally\neffective in EEG pathology classification."}

The compromised model behaves normally on clean\nsamples but misclassifies backdoored samples into the attacker-specified target\nclass, posing a significant threat to real-world DNN applications. Currently,\nseveral empirical defense methods have been proposed to mitigate backdoor\nattacks, but they are often bypassed by more advanced backdoor techniques. In\ncontrast, certified defenses based on randomized smoothing have shown promise\nby adding random noise to training and testing samples to counteract backdoor\nattacks. In this paper, we reveal that existing randomized smoothing defenses\nimplicitly assume that all samples are equidistant from the decision boundary.\nHowever, it may not hold in practice, leading to suboptimal certification\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose a sample-specific certified\nbackdoor defense method, termed Cert-SSB. Cert-SSB first employs stochastic\ngradient ascent to optimize the noise magnitude for each sample, ensuring a\nsample-specific noise level that is then applied to multiple poisoned training\nsets to retrain several smoothed models. After that, Cert-SSB aggregates the\npredictions of multiple smoothed models to generate the final robust\nprediction. In particular, in this case, existing certification methods become\ninapplicable since the optimized noise varies across different samples. To\nconquer this challenge, we introduce a storage-update-based certification\nmethod, which dynamically adjusts each sample's certification region to improve\ncertification performance.

We demonstrate that a single network, trained with domain\nrandomization, can robustly control various types of quadcopters. The network\nrelies solely on the current state to directly compute motor commands. The\neffectiveness of this generalized controller is validated through real-world\ntests on two substantially different crafts (3-inch and 5-inch race\nquadcopters). We further compare the performance of this generalized controller\nwith controllers specifically trained for the 3-inch and 5-inch drone, using\ntheir identified model parameters with varying levels of domain randomization\n(0%, 10%, 20%, 30%). While the generalized controller shows slightly slower\nspeeds compared to the fine-tuned models, it excels in adaptability across\ndifferent platforms. Our results show that no randomization fails sim-to-real\ntransfer while increasing randomization improves robustness but reduces speed.\nDespite this trade-off, our findings highlight the potential of domain\nrandomization for generalizing controllers, paving the way for universal AI\ncontrollers that can adapt to any platform."}

Existing datasets\nare small, with at most 1,000s of training instances from 11 or fewer GitHub\nrepositories. The procedures to curate such datasets are often complex,\nnecessitating hundreds of hours of human labor; companion execution\nenvironments also take up several terabytes of storage, severely limiting their\nscalability and usability. To address this pain point, we introduce SWE-smith,\na novel pipeline for generating software engineering training data at scale.\nGiven any Python codebase, SWE-smith constructs a corresponding execution\nenvironment, then automatically synthesizes 100s to 1,000s of task instances\nthat break existing test(s) in the codebase. Using SWE-smith, we create a\ndataset of 50k instances sourced from 128 GitHub repositories, an order of\nmagnitude larger than all previous works. We train SWE-agent-LM-32B, achieving\n40.2% Pass@1 resolve rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, state of the art\namong open source models. We open source SWE-smith (collection procedure, task\ninstances, trajectories, models) to lower the barrier of entry for research in\nLM systems for automated software engineering.

We systematically\ncompare real and synthetic dialogues using linguistic, structural, and\nprotocol-specific metrics, including turn-taking patterns and treatment\nfidelity. We also introduce and evaluate PE-specific metrics derived from\nlinguistic analysis and semantic modeling, offering a novel framework for\nassessing clinical fidelity beyond surface fluency. Our findings show that\nalthough synthetic data holds promise for mitigating data scarcity and\nprotecting patient privacy, it can struggle to capture the subtle dynamics of\ntherapeutic interactions. In our dataset, synthetic dialogues match structural\nfeatures of real-world dialogues (e.g., speaker switch ratio: 0.98 vs. 0.99),\nhowever, synthetic interactions do not adequately reflect key fidelity markers\n(e.g., distress monitoring). We highlight gaps in existing evaluation\nframeworks and advocate for fidelity-aware metrics that go beyond surface\nfluency to uncover clinically significant failures. Our findings clarify where\nsynthetic data can effectively complement real-world datasets -- and where\ncritical limitations remain."}

The\ncold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose\ncomplex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are\nsynthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3's\nstep-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement\nlearning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal\nmathematical reasoning into a unified model. The resulting model,\nDeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural\ntheorem proving, reaching 88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49\nout of 658 problems from PutnamBench. In addition to standard benchmarks, we\nintroduce ProverBench, a collection of 325 formalized problems, to enrich our\nevaluation, including 15 selected problems from the recent AIME competitions\n(years 24-25). Further evaluation on these 15 AIME problems shows that the\nmodel successfully solves 6 of them.

This work proposes Spotlight, a low-overhead\nand unobtrusive system for protecting live speech videos from visual\nfalsification of speaker identity and lip and facial motion. Unlike predominant\nfalsification detection methods operating in the digital domain, Spotlight\ncreates dynamic physical signatures at the event site and embeds them into all\nvideo recordings via imperceptible modulated light. These physical signatures\nencode semantically-meaningful features unique to the speech event, including\nthe speaker's identity and facial motion, and are cryptographically-secured to\nprevent spoofing. The signatures can be extracted from any video downstream and\nvalidated against the portrayed speech content to check its integrity. Key\nelements of Spotlight include (1) a framework for generating extremely compact\n(i.e., 150-bit), pose-invariant speech video features, based on\nlocality-sensitive hashing; and (2) an optical modulation scheme that embeds\n>200 bps into video while remaining imperceptible both in video and live.\nPrototype experiments on extensive video datasets show Spotlight achieves AUCs\n$\\geq$ 0.99 and an overall true positive rate of 100% in detecting falsified\nvideos. Further, Spotlight is highly robust across recording conditions, video\npost-processing techniques, and white-box adversarial attacks on its video\nfeature extraction methodologies."}

We propose\ndifferent gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises\nunique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems.\nMoreover, we draw upon this framework to construct \"agentic profiles\" for\ndifferent kinds of AI agents.

Our findings reveal broad public support for AI regulation, with risk\nperception playing a significant role in shaping policy preferences.\nIndividuals with higher trust in government favor regulation, while those with\ngreater trust in AI companies and AI technologies are less inclined to support\nrestrictions. Trust in government and perceived risks significantly predict\npreferences for both soft (e.g., slowing development) and strong (e.g., banning\nAI systems) regulatory interventions. These results highlight the importance of\npublic opinion in AI governance. As AI capabilities advance, effective\nregulation will require balancing public concerns about risks with trust in\ninstitutions. This study provides a foundational empirical baseline for\npolicymakers navigating AI governance and underscores the need for further\nresearch into public trust, risk perception, and regulatory strategies in the\nevolving AI landscape."}

This study aims to\nbridge the gap in mental healthcare accessibility by developing an LLM-powered\ndialogue system that replicates clinician behavior. Materials and Methods: We\nintroduce TRUST, a framework of cooperative LLM modules capable of conducting\nformal diagnostic interviews and assessments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\n(PTSD). To guide the generation of appropriate clinical responses, we propose a\nDialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews.\nAdditionally, we develop a patient simulation approach based on real-life\ninterview transcripts to replace time-consuming and costly manual testing by\nclinicians. Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to\nassess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation\nperspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show\nthat TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion:\nOur system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future\nenhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions:\nOur TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare\navailability."}
