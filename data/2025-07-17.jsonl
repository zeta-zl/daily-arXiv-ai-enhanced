Manuscript submitted for review to the Journal of\n  Computational Literary Studies (JCLS)", "summary": "This study positions large language models (LLMs) as \"subjective literary\ncritics\" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary\nassessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into\nEnglish and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent\nsessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed\nsignificant variations in evaluation consistency ({\\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to\n0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance\nacross stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming\ndistinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session\nwithin-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically\nminimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped\nby RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that\nLLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human\ncritical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers."}

The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model\ntemporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample\nmechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies.

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering).

This\nwork demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,\nresulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved\nswarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning\nrules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in\nstandard benchmarking tasks."}

Mechanistic approaches incorporate population density and facility\ndistribution but assume static scenarios, limiting their utility for future\nprojections where historical data for calibration is unavailable. This study\nintroduces a novel, data-driven approach for generating origin-destination\nmobility flows tailored to simulated urban scenarios. Our method leverages\nadaptive factors such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and it\nutilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend\nhistorical data with these adaptive parameters. The approach facilitates rapid\nmobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions\nof interest, without requiring extensive calibration data or complex behavior\nmodeling. The promising performance of our approach is demonstrated by its\napplication to mobile phone data from Singapore, and by its comparison with\nexisting methods."}

All of these\nadvances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture\ntailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on\n1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-\nand data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical\nnumerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a\nsingle GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\\deg}, 6-hourly\nresolution in under 20 seconds.

The\ninability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their\nover-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards\ngeneral-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models\n(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline.

The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed\nthis skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows\nthat sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit\nwell-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This\nsuccess has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model\nfor learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of\nrequired iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We\nargue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another\nperspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the\noptimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative\nproperties of the learned solutions.

The high altitude and mobility of NTN\npresent new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,\nhindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native\nartificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in\ndisaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works\npropose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN\ndeployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a\nholistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps\nlifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses\nthe scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first\nprovide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the\nstate-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges\nthat motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based\nNTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These\ninclude the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent\ncontrollers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment\narchitecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research\ndirections, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other\nenabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are\nhighlighted."}

The simplified images allow accurate measurements\nof the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined\nset of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images\nacquired by the DESI Legacy Survey.

DLCs\nare sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image\nembeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables\nsampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models\ntrained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,\nwe show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce\nout-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in\ndiverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation\nby leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a\ntext diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples\noutside of the image generator training distribution."}

In this work, we demonstrate that employing\nNPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we\nextend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,\nthe NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating\nfundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support\ndeletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational\ncomplexity of the NPD is $O(AN\\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a\ncomputational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.\nWe evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates\n$\\delta\\in\\{0.01, 0.1\\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by\nthe trellis decoder by Tal et al.

To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted\nranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on\nsimilarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a\nsample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by\nsimilarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these\nscores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over\n500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to\nthem. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation\nbenchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline\n(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks\nacross all scales.
