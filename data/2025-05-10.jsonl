A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.SI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life,\ninstead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with\nonly one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently\nplay roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social\nsettings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically\nmeasured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an\nagent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles.\nConcurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII\nbelow), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social\nagents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages:\nformat parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable\nconversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion\ncapabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset,\nHSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform\nan ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs'\nsocial performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new\nstatistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs\nwith COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between\nmeasurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments\ndemonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in\nLLMs."}

Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented\nhas been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that\npolicy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a\npotential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is\nunsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, \"Value-free\" --\nwhile they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting\n(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching\nto PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of\nbehavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems\nfrom the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by\nthe standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve\nit. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as\npart of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the\ndifferent methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,\ninstead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the\nunderlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from\nan experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be\nreconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,\nfull-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are\nrelaxed, as is likely in natural settings.

Domain\nknowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid')\nand generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory:\nEvolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a\nsignificant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced\nunderstanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate\ninformation retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of\nKnowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without\nretraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of\nMind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role:\nResidual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to\nmaintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures\nuser-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension;\nLLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for\nrefinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory,\ndetect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy.\nTemporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information\nwhile discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground\nTruth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference;\nDomain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and\nmanufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets;\nPersonalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user\npreferences, ensuring coherent responses over time."}

However, the dynamic topologies hinder the efficient\nlong-term joint power and antenna array resource allocation for THz links among\nUAVs. Furthermore, the continuous nature of power and the discrete nature of\nantennas cause this joint resource allocation problem to be a mixed-integer\nnonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with non-convexity and NP-hardness.\nInspired by recent rapid advancements in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a\ngraph neural network (GNN) aided DRL algorithm for resource allocation in the\ndynamic THz UAV network with an emphasis on self-node features (GLOVE) is\nproposed in this paper, with the aim of resource efficiency (RE) maximization.\nWhen training the allocation policy for each UAV, GLOVE learns the relationship\nbetween this UAV and its neighboring UAVs via GNN, while also emphasizing the\nimportant self-node features of this UAV. In addition, a multi-task structure\nis leveraged by GLOVE to cooperatively train resource allocation decisions for\nthe power and sub-arrays of all UAVs. Experimental results illustrate that\nGLOVE outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the highest RE and the lowest\nlatency.

To optimize OpenworldAUC\neffectively, we introduce Gated Mixture-of-Prompts (GMoP), which employs\ndomain-specific prompts and a gating mechanism to dynamically balance detection\nand classification. Theoretical guarantees ensure generalization of GMoP under\npractical conditions.

While HHEM and Vectara's Hallucination Leaderboard have garnered great\nresearch interest, we examine challenges faced by HHEM and current\nhallucination detection methods by analyzing the effectiveness of these methods\non existing hallucination datasets. To address these limitations, we propose\nFaithJudge, an LLM-as-a-judge approach guided by few-shot human hallucination\nannotations, which substantially improves automated LLM hallucination\nevaluation over current methods. We introduce an enhanced hallucination\nleaderboard centered on FaithJudge, alongside our current hallucination\nleaderboard, enabling more reliable benchmarking of LLMs for hallucinations in\nRAG."}

We contrast\nearly symbolic discovery systems (e.g., BACON, KEKADA) with modern LLM\npipelines that leverage in-context learning and domain adaptation via\nfine-tuning, retrieval, and symbolic grounding. For validation, we review\nsimulation, human-AI collaboration, causal modeling, and uncertainty\nquantification, emphasizing iterative assessment in open-world contexts. The\nsurvey maps datasets across biomedicine, materials science, environmental\nscience, and social science, introducing new resources like AHTech and\nCSKG-600. Finally, we outline a roadmap emphasizing novelty-aware generation,\nmultimodal-symbolic integration, human-in-the-loop systems, and ethical\nsafeguards, positioning LLMs as agents for principled, scalable scientific\ndiscovery."}

The performance\nof such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a\ntime-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the\nsetting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking for physically\nsimulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically\nused to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain\nexpertise and significant manual adjustment, but also limit the applicability\nof the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we\npresent a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is\nbroadly applicable to a range of multi-objective optimization problems,\nincluding motion tracking.

A\npotential solution is to build a Question-Answering (QA) system that answers\nuser queries based on building codes. Among the various methods for building a\nQA system, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out in performance. RAG\nconsists of two components: a retriever and a language model. This study\nfocuses on identifying a suitable retriever method for building codes and\noptimizing the generational capability of the language model using fine-tuning\ntechniques. We conducted a detailed evaluation of various retrieval methods by\nperforming the retrieval on the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) and\nexplored the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning on several language models\nusing the dataset derived from NBCC.

In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking\nscheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by\nintroducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a\ntwo-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First,\nChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly\napplying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated\nwith trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner.\nThen, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the\noriginal and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted\nlabels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a\nmore accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability\nof specific models.

Compound metric optimization outperformed single-metric\nstrategies, producing more balanced and generalizable synthetic datasets.\nInterestingly, HPO alone is insufficient to ensure clinically valid synthetic\ndata, as all models exhibited violations of fundamental survival constraints.\nPreprocessing and postprocessing played a crucial role in reducing these\nviolations, as models lacking robust processing steps produced invalid data in\nup to 61% of cases. These findings underscore the necessity of integrating\nexplicit domain knowledge alongside HPO to create high quality synthetic\ndatasets. Our study provides actionable recommendations for improving synthetic\ndata generation, with future research needed to refine metric selection and\nvalidate these findings on larger datasets to enhance clinical applicability."}

Yet, the idea that action-values are explicitly represented\nhas been extensively debated. Critics had therefore repeatedly suggested that\npolicy-gradient (PG) models should be favored over value-based (VB) ones, as a\npotential solution for this dilemma. Here we argue that this solution is\nunsatisfying. This is because PG methods are not, in fact, \"Value-free\" --\nwhile they do not rely on an explicit representation of Value for acting\n(stimulus-response mapping), they do require it for learning. Hence, switching\nto PG models is, per se, insufficient for eliminating Value from models of\nbehavior. More broadly, the requirement for a representation of Value stems\nfrom the underlying assumptions regarding the optimization objective posed by\nthe standard RL framework, not from the particular algorithm chosen to solve\nit. Previous studies mostly took these standard RL assumptions for granted, as\npart of their conceptualization or problem modeling, while debating the\ndifferent methods used to optimize it (i.e., PG or VB). We propose that,\ninstead, the focus of the debate should shift to critically evaluating the\nunderlying modeling assumptions. Such evaluation is particularly important from\nan experimental perspective. Indeed, the very notion of Value must be\nreconsidered when standard assumptions (e.g., risk neutrality,\nfull-observability, Markovian environment, exponential discounting) are\nrelaxed, as is likely in natural settings. Finally, we use the Value debate as\na case study to argue in favor of a more nuanced, algorithmic rather than\nstatistical, view of what constitutes \"a model\" in cognitive sciences. Our\nanalysis suggests that besides \"parametric\" statistical complexity, additional\naspects such as computational complexity must also be taken into account when\nevaluating model complexity."}

Our findings reveal that one of\nthese activation-informed operators outperforms random pruning, resulting in\nmore efficient autoencoders with comparable performance to canonically trained\nmodels.

In the context of elasticity\nand heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss\nand techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data\nlead to different ``constraint forces\" -- which we define as additional source\nterms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can\nsignificantly influence the reconstructed solution.

Third, we discover an\neffective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we\nobserve that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource\nlanguages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in\nparticular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English.\nOverall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the\nlimitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time\nscaling. We conclude that practitioners should let English-centric RLMs reason\nin high-resource languages, while further work is needed to improve reasoning\nin low-resource languages and out-of-domain contexts."}

However, the effectiveness of such monitoring hinges on CoTs\nfaithfully representing models' actual reasoning processes. We evaluate CoT\nfaithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints\npresented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested,\nCoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the\nhint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement\nlearning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and\n(3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward\nhacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without\ntraining against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a\npromising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations,\nbut that it is not sufficient to rule them out. They also suggest that in\nsettings like ours where CoT reasoning is not necessary, test-time monitoring\nof CoTs is unlikely to reliably catch rare and catastrophic unexpected\nbehaviors."}

The simulated system closely\nfollows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime\nof agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly\noptimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing\nvaluable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more\ngenerally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing\nare primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.\nThese are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference\ngoal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The\nregime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical\ndamping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple\nstages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to\na diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between\nquasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and\nincoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales\nof space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the\nbest-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the\nresponding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is\ninterpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding\nlearning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body\nphysics out of equilibrium."}

However, these methods suffer from the\nissues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the\nnoisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and\ndispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we\npropose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and\nprovide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our\nmethod using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the\nflexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance\nof LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple\nbase and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with\nbenchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show\nthe effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations\nof existing direct alignment methods.
