Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such\nAI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or\nlyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to\ngeneralize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio\nperturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate\nlyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnovel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion\npipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech\nfeatures capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on\nlyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates\nsusceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.\nExperiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based\ndetectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations.

While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies.

To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English.

To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of\ndecoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output\ndistributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by\nthis, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning\nbehaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small\nRL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU\nmemory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than\nthe RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of\nRL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without\nincurring its full computational cost.

The upper-level\nmeta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to\nselect SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify\ndifficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple\nSLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use\nthe difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller\nlayer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages\nthrough a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of\nSLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing\nopen-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.\nNotably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to\ndirectly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by\n6.21%.

The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents."}

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but\ntheir approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like\nhigh peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between\nmethods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified\nmetric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their\nlifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they\nattain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and\ngeneration, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the\nhigh peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --\n*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with\neviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs\nduring pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn\nto *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end\noptimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full\nKV cache and which do not.

In practice, data often arrive in\nbatches, and expert knowledge is scarce. Language Models (LMs) offer a\nsurrogate but come with their own issues-hallucinations, inconsistencies, and\nbias. We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid\nBayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential\nbatch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both\ndata-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates\nambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global\nLM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a\nsequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative\nedges.

In this paper, we propose a novel method,\n$\\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL\nagents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder\nworks by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to\ncompleting a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to\nidentify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to\nrank them using pairwise comparisons.

Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with\nminimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,\nwhich is trained on unlabelled visual data.

In this work, we present GalCatDiff, the first framework in\nastronomy to leverage both galaxy image features and astrophysical properties\nin the network design of diffusion models. GalCatDiff incorporates an enhanced\nU-Net and a novel block entitled Astro-RAB (Residual Attention Block), which\ndynamically combines attention mechanisms with convolution operations to ensure\nglobal consistency and local feature fidelity. Moreover, GalCatDiff uses\ncategory embeddings for class-specific galaxy generation, avoiding the high\ncomputational costs of training separate models for each category. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that GalCatDiff significantly outperforms\nexisting methods in terms of the consistency of sample color and size\ndistributions, and the generated galaxies are both visually realistic and\nphysically consistent.

This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation.

In particular, our contrastive learning method minimizes the\ndistance between embeddings of the same metapath and maximizes the distance\nbetween those of different metapaths in hyperbolic space, thereby improving the\nseparability of metapath embeddings with distinct semantic information. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of MHCL.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also\noutlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML\npipeline."}

We present an\nalternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir\ncomputing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and\nmaps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly\nparallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in\nneural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,\nadaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our\nreservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination\nfidelity.

In contrast, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) holds the promise of enabling autonomous online policy\nimprovement, but often falls short of achieving this due to the large number of\nsamples it typically requires. In this work we take steps towards enabling fast\nautonomous adaptation of BC-trained policies via efficient real-world RL.\nFocusing in particular on diffusion policies -- a state-of-the-art BC\nmethodology -- we propose diffusion steering via reinforcement learning (DSRL):\nadapting the BC policy by running RL over its latent-noise space. We show that\nDSRL is highly sample efficient, requires only black-box access to the BC\npolicy, and enables effective real-world autonomous policy improvement.\nFurthermore, DSRL avoids many of the challenges associated with finetuning\ndiffusion policies, obviating the need to modify the weights of the base policy\nat all. We demonstrate DSRL on simulated benchmarks, real-world robotic tasks,\nand for adapting pretrained generalist policies, illustrating its sample\nefficiency and effective performance at real-world policy improvement."}

Employing this approach enables\nsimultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while\nproviding a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto\n(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding\nto enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and\nfinite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nparticularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution\nis non-uniform.

We achieve a\nPareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual\ngeneral-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds\non Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised\nfine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with\nverifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate\ndata to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks\ninvolving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general\ninstruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B.\nOur smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and\nproprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers\nbest-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top\nresults in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we\nintroduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our\nfindings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general\ncapabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as\ntranslation and localization."}

We develop a pipeline to generate\nsemantic segmentation and then transform it into instance-level segmentation.\nThe proposed approach substantially outperforms the conventional instance\nsegmentation models, establishing a state-of-the-art wheat head instance\nsegmentation model with mAP@50 of 98.5%. Additionally, we assessed the proposed\nmethodology on the general-purpose Microsoft COCO dataset, achieving a\nsignificant performance improvement of over 12.6% mAP@50. This highlights that\nthe utility of our proposed approach extends beyond precision agriculture and\napplies to other domains, specifically those with similar data characteristics."}

A\nsmall set of low-level source features is aligned to the target domain\nsemantics-specified only through a natural language prompt-via Prompt-driven\nInstance Normalization (PIN). These semantically steered features are used to\nbriefly fine-tune the detection head of the teacher model. The adapted teacher\nthen generates high-quality pseudo-labels, which guide the on-the-fly\nadaptation of a compact student model. Experiments on the MDS-A dataset\ndemonstrate that Prmpt2Adpt achieves competitive detection performance compared\nto state-of-the-art methods, while delivering up to 7x faster adaptation and 5x\nfaster inference speed using few source images-making it a practical and\nscalable solution for real-time adaptation in low-resource domains."}
