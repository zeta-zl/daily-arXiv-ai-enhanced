Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation. Additionally, our\nsafety reminder only activates when harmful content is detected, leaving normal\nconversations unaffected and preserving the model's performance on benign\ntasks. Through comprehensive evaluation across three established safety\nbenchmarks and one adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining model utility,\noffering a practical solution for deploying safer VLMs in real-world\napplications."}

This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such\nAI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or\nlyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to\ngeneralize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio\nperturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate\nlyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnovel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion\npipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech\nfeatures capturing lyrics-related information within the audio. By relying on\nlyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates\nsusceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability.\nExperiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based\ndetectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations.

While substantial efforts have been made to\nimprove their robustness, existing defenses often rely on costly fine-tuning of\nmodel parameters or employ suboptimal heuristic techniques. In this work, we\ntake a novel approach to safeguard LLMs by learning to adapt the system prompts\nin instruction-tuned LLMs. While LLMs are typically pre-trained to follow a\nfixed system prompt, we investigate the impact of tailoring the system prompt\nto each specific user input on the safety of the responses. To this end, we\npropose $\\textbf{Sysformer}$, a trans$\\textbf{former}$ model that updates an\ninitial $\\textbf{sys}$tem prompt to a more robust system prompt in the LLM\ninput embedding space while attending to the user prompt. While keeping the LLM\nparameters frozen, the Sysformer is trained to refuse to respond to a set of\nharmful prompts while responding ideally to a set of safe ones. Through\nextensive experiments on $5$ LLMs from different families and $2$ recent\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that Sysformer can significantly enhance the\nrobustness of LLMs, leading to upto $80\\%$ gain in the refusal rate on harmful\nprompts while enhancing the compliance with the safe prompts by upto $90\\%$.\nResults also generalize well to sophisticated jailbreaking attacks, making LLMs\nupto $100\\%$ more robust against different attack strategies.

To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English.

To verify our hypothesis, we conduct a token-level analysis of\ndecoding trajectories and find high alignment in RL-induced output\ndistributions across model scales, validating our hypothesis. Motivated by\nthis, we propose RAST, a simple yet effective method that transfers reasoning\nbehaviors by injecting RL-induced probability adjustments from a small\nRL-trained model into larger models. Experiments across multiple mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks show that RAST substantially and consistently enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of base models while requiring significantly lower GPU\nmemory than direct RL training, sometimes even yielding better performance than\nthe RL-trained counterparts. Our findings offer new insights into the nature of\nRL-driven reasoning and practical strategies for scaling its benefits without\nincurring its full computational cost.

The upper-level\nmeta-controller layer uses the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to\nselect SLMs for annotation, automatically generate annotation code and verify\ndifficult samples; the lower-level task-specialist layer consists of multiple\nSLMs that perform annotation through multi-model voting. In addition, we use\nthe difficult samples obtained by the secondary review of the meta-controller\nlayer as the reinforcement learning set and fine-tune the SLMs in stages\nthrough a continual learning strategy, thereby improving the generalization of\nSLMs. Extensive experiments show that AutoAnnotator outperforms existing\nopen-source/API LLMs in zero-shot, one-shot, CoT, and majority voting settings.\nNotably, AutoAnnotator reduces the annotation cost by 74.15% compared to\ndirectly annotating with GPT-3.5-turbo, while still improving the accuracy by\n6.21%.

The emergence\nof \"thinking\" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither\nproduce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is\nmore likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent\nunderstanding of when model-free RL will lead to \"thinking\" as a strategy for\nreward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a\ntheoretical model which we call a \\textit{thought Markov decision process}\n(MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an\nabstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP\nmodel, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether\nor not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent\nto the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing\nto act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our\ntheory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like\nbehavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable\nthinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy\ndomain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought\nactions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents."}

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but\ntheir approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like\nhigh peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between\nmethods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified\nmetric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their\nlifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they\nattain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and\ngeneration, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the\nhigh peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods --\n*post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with\neviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs\nduring pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn\nto *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end\noptimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full\nKV cache and which do not.

We present BLANCE (Bayesian LM-Augmented Causal Estimation)-a hybrid\nBayesian framework that bridges these gaps by adaptively integrating sequential\nbatch data with LM-derived noisy, expert knowledge while accounting for both\ndata-induced and LM-induced biases. Our proposed representation shift from\nDirected Acyclic Graph (DAG) to Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) accommodates\nambiguities within a coherent Bayesian framework, allowing grounding the global\nLM knowledge in local observational data. To guide LM interaction, we use a\nsequential optimization scheme that adaptively queries the most informative\nedges.

We\nevaluate our system on newly composed datasets covering single-human,\nmulti-human, and non-human scenarios, providing both the methodology and code\nfor dataset creation to establish reproducible benchmarks. Our analysis reveals\nbiases in prior SOTA work, particularly in SeSyn-Net's preprocessing pipeline,\nleading to inflated performance claims. We correct these biases and propose a\nmore rigorous evaluation framework, demonstrating that VideoSync outperforms\nexisting approaches, including SeSyn-Net, under fair experimental conditions.\nAdditionally, we explore various synchronization offset prediction methods,\nidentifying a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model as the most\neffective.

Consequently, small shifts in hidden\nactivations can re-trigger harmful behaviors embedded in the latent space. To\nexplore the robustness of safety alignment to latent perturbations, we\nintroduce a probing method that measures the Negative Log-Likelihood of the\noriginal response generated by the model.

The ability to extract rewards\nfrom a language instruction can enable the development of robotic systems that\ncan learn from human guidance; however, it remains a challenging problem,\nespecially in visual environments. Existing approaches that employ large,\npretrained language models either rely on non-visual environment\nrepresentations, require prohibitively large amounts of feedback, or generate\nnoisy, ill-shaped reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel method,\n$\\textbf{GoalLadder}$, that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to train RL\nagents from a single language instruction in visual environments. GoalLadder\nworks by incrementally discovering states that bring the agent closer to\ncompleting a task specified in natural language. To do so, it queries a VLM to\nidentify states that represent an improvement in agent's task progress and to\nrank them using pairwise comparisons. Unlike prior work, GoalLadder does not\ntrust VLM's feedback completely; instead, it uses it to rank potential goal\nstates using an ELO-based rating system, thus reducing the detrimental effects\nof noisy VLM feedback. Over the course of training, the agent is tasked with\nminimising the distance to the top-ranked goal in a learned embedding space,\nwhich is trained on unlabelled visual data. This key feature allows us to\nbypass the need for abundant and accurate feedback typically required to train\na well-shaped reward function.

We show\nthat in 2-hop reasoning tasks with a latent, discrete concept, the model\nsuccessfully identifies the latent concept and does step-by-step concept\ncomposition. In tasks parameterized by a continuous latent concept, we find\nlow-dimensional subspaces in the representation space where the geometry mimics\nthe underlying parameterization. Together, these results refine our\nunderstanding of ICL and the representation of transformers, and they provide\nevidence for highly localized structures in the model that disentangle latent\nconcepts in ICL tasks."}

If, as linguistic relativity suggests, the structure\nof language shapes cognitive patterns, then large language models (LLMs)\ntrained on human language may also internalize the habitual logical structures\nembedded in different languages. To examine this hypothesis, we introduce\nBICAUSE, a structured bilingual dataset for causal reasoning, which includes\nsemantically aligned Chinese and English samples in both forward and reversed\ncausal forms. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) LLMs exhibit\ntypologically aligned attention patterns, focusing more on causes and\nsentence-initial connectives in Chinese, while showing a more balanced\ndistribution in English. (2) Models internalize language-specific preferences\nfor causal word order and often rigidly apply them to atypical inputs, leading\nto degraded performance, especially in Chinese.

Most existing methods for treatment\neffect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding\nthrough observed covariate adjustment.

To address this\nfoundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to\nmaximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with\nBackdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative,\nclinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable\ntreatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent\nconfounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments\nin psychiatric longitudinal data.

This approach may fail to effectively\ncapture the diverse power-law structures within heterogeneous graphs.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems.

Our results highlight the\ninfluence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations\nto benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are\nstill strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep\nlearning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At\nthe same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show\nthat ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine\nlearning and investigate the contributions of individual models. We launch\nTabArena with a public leaderboard, reproducible code, and maintenance\nprotocols to create a living benchmark available at https://tabarena.ai."}

Unlike traditional Large Language\nModels (LLMs), VLMs face unique vulnerabilities due to their multimodal nature,\nallowing adversaries to modify visual or textual inputs to bypass safety\nguardrails and trigger the generation of harmful content. Through systematic\nanalysis of VLM behavior under attack, we identify a novel phenomenon termed\n``delayed safety awareness''. Specifically, we observe that safety-aligned VLMs\nmay initially be compromised to produce harmful content, but eventually\nrecognize the associated risks and attempt to self-correct. This pattern\nsuggests that VLMs retain their underlying safety awareness but experience a\ntemporal delay in their activation. Building on this insight, we hypothesize\nthat VLMs' safety awareness can be proactively reactivated through carefully\ndesigned prompts. To this end, we introduce ``The Safety Reminder'', a soft\nprompt tuning approach that optimizes learnable prompt tokens, which are\nperiodically injected during the text generation process to enhance safety\nawareness, effectively preventing harmful content generation.

But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML morally wrong? And\nwhy should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly\nappeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable goods and benefits,\nsuch as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally\ndistributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because\nthey unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive\nfocus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading\nethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism -- the view that\nequality is a fundamental moral and social ideal -- requires challenging\nstructural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that\nprivilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality\nmanifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g.,\neconomic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While\ndistributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why\nrepresentational harms are wrong -- why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce\nsocial hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups --\nand why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals\n(i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a\nmultifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both\ndistributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political\nphilosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for\ntackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also\noutlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the ML\npipeline."}

While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities\ntoward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.\nTraditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account\nfor crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to\nreduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use\nneural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity.

We present an\nalternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir\ncomputing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and\nmaps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly\nparallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in\nneural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,\nadaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our\nreservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination\nfidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error\nreductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,\nrespectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit\ndataset.

Employing this approach enables\nsimultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while\nproviding a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The\nproposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown,\ntreating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input\nsamples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to\nestimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and\noptimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves\na two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training\nphase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step\nestimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the\nimprovement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI\nestimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is\nused to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto\n(HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding\nto enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and\nfinite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nparticularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution\nis non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit\nerror rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for\nblock lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in\nreal-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and\npractical coding performance."}

However, existing query-driven models often\nrequire access to data or summaries for best performance, and they assume\nperfect training workloads with complete and balanced join templates (or join\ngraphs). Such assumptions rarely hold in real-world scenarios, in which join\ntemplates are incomplete and imbalanced. We present GRASP, a data-agnostic\ncardinality learning system designed to work under these real-world\nconstraints. GRASP's compositional design generalizes to unseen join templates\nand is robust to join template imbalance. It also introduces a new per-table\nCardEst model that handles value distribution shifts for range predicates, and\na novel learned count sketch model that captures join correlations across base\nrelations. Across three database instances, we demonstrate that GRASP\nconsistently outperforms existing query-driven models on imperfect workloads,\nboth in terms of estimation accuracy and query latency. Remarkably, GRASP\nachieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional approaches\nbuilt over the underlying data on the complex CEB-IMDb-full benchmark --\ndespite operating without any data access and using only 10% of all possible\njoin templates."}

Our results reveal an intricate\ninterplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving\nidentifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with\nnon-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions,\nwhile encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not\ngrow too rapidly. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection\nbetween deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type\nuniqueness theorems. This yields both generic conditions determined by the\narchitecture, and effective conditions that depend on the network's parameters.\nWe also settle an open conjecture on the expected dimension of PNN's\nneurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for\nit to reach its maximum."}

A Siamese model,\nconsisting of two shared-parameter Structure2vec networks, is then employed to\nlearn the deep semantics of each pair of ACFGs and generate their embeddings.\nFinally, the similarity between the embeddings of each pair of ACFGs is\ncalculated to determine the collaborator's trust value at each time slot.
