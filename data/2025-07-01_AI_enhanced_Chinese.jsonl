For most of these tasks, performance can be measured with\nobjective metrics, such as the number of correct answers. However, other\nlanguage features are not easily quantified. For example, arousal,\nconcreteness, or gender associated with a given word, as well as the extent to\nwhich we experience words with senses and relate them to a specific sense.\nThose features have been studied for many years by psycholinguistics,\nconducting large-scale experiments with humans to produce ratings for thousands\nof words. This opens an opportunity to evaluate how well LLMs align with human\nratings on these word features, taking advantage of existing studies that cover\nmany different language features in a large number of words. In this paper, we\nevaluate the alignment of a representative group of LLMs with human ratings on\ntwo psycholinguistic datasets: the Glasgow and Lancaster norms. These datasets\ncover thirteen features over thousands of words. The results show that\nalignment is \\textcolor{black}{generally} better in the Glasgow norms evaluated\n(arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, and\ngender) than on the Lancaster norms evaluated (introceptive, gustatory,\nolfactory, haptic, auditory, and visual). This suggests a potential limitation\nof current LLMs in aligning with human sensory associations for words, which\nmay be due to their lack of embodied cognition present in humans and\nillustrates the usefulness of evaluating LLMs with psycholinguistic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5355\u8bcd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u611f\u5b98\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u54e5\u548c\u5170\u5361\u65af\u7279\u89c4\u8303\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d613\u79cd\u5355\u8bcd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83LLMs\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u5728\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u54e5\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u60c5\u611f\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f18\u4e8e\u5170\u5361\u65af\u7279\u89c4\u8303\uff08\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u8ba4\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "keywords": "LLMs, \u5fc3\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66, \u5355\u8bcd\u7279\u5f81, \u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30, \u611f\u5b98\u5173\u8054"}}

Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module\nto refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.\nExperiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and\nconsistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.\nThe improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art\nperformance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.\nNotably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token\ncost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ReG\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91cd\u7ec4\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528LLM\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u7ec4\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u903b\u8f91\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReG\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe10%\uff0c\u4ec5\u97005%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "ReG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56feRAG\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "keywords": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210,\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31,\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b,\u5f31\u76d1\u7763,\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u7ec4"}}

A\ndrafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language\nmodels, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree\nconsisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target\nmodel, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered\nthat the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies\nof the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the\nvocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We\nfirst identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an\nunnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs\nwith very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim,\nto mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in\nmemory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain\nonly a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the\nvocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting\nslightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting\nlatency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices,\nresulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU).

In this work, we demonstrate that both\nRLHF and DPO can be interpreted from the perspective of mutual information (MI)\nmaximization, uncovering a profound connection to contrastive learning. Within\nthis framework, both RLHF and DPO can be viewed as methods that perform\ncontrastive learning based on the positive and negative samples derived from\nthe base model, leveraging the Donsker-Varadhan (DV) lower bound on MI\n(equivalently, the MINE estimator).

This is particularly useful for achieving adversarial robustness, as\nadversarially training models from scratch is very computationally expensive.\nHowever, high robustness in transfer learning still requires adversarial\ntraining during the fine-tuning phase, which requires up to an order of\nmagnitude more time than standard fine-tuning. In this work, we revisit the use\nof the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) in robust transfer learning to improve\nthe computational cost of adversarial fine-tuning. We surprisingly find that\nFGSM is much more stable in adversarial fine-tuning than when training from\nscratch. In particular, FGSM fine-tuning does not suffer from any issues with\ncatastrophic overfitting at standard perturbation budgets of $\\varepsilon=4$ or\n$\\varepsilon=8$. This stability is further enhanced with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning methods, where FGSM remains stable even up to $\\varepsilon=32$ for\nlinear probing. We demonstrate how this stability translates into performance\nacross multiple datasets. Compared to fine-tuning with the more commonly used\nmethod of projected gradient descent (PGD), on average, FGSM only loses 0.39%\nand 1.39% test robustness for $\\varepsilon=4$ and $\\varepsilon=8$ while using\n$4\\times$ less training time.

We compare model-generated decisions with\nactual human responses in a series of lottery-based tasks, using transportation\nstated preference survey data from participants in Sydney, Dhaka, Hong Kong,\nand Nanjing. Demographic inputs were provided to two LLMs -- ChatGPT 4o and\nChatGPT o1-mini -- which were tasked with predicting individual choices. Risk\npreferences were analyzed using the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA)\nframework. Results show that both models exhibit more risk-averse behavior than\nhuman participants, with o1-mini aligning more closely with observed human\ndecisions. Further analysis of multilingual data from Nanjing and Hong Kong\nindicates that model predictions in Chinese deviate more from actual responses\ncompared to English, suggesting that prompt language may influence simulation\nperformance.

VFT\nachieves this by substantially increasing how often models verbalize the\ninfluence of cues--from 8% to 42% after VFT, and up to 94% after RL--while\nbaselines remain low even after RL (10% and 1%).

In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

We call this model the Residual Matrix\nTransformer (RMT).

In this\npaper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and\npresent the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs.\nWe examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns,\nlinguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably\nidentify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT\nand Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case\nstudies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration\nthrough prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety\nvulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak\nsusceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of\nidentity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further\nunderstanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent\ndeployments.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of all the variants in our framework across language modeling,\nsyntactic generalization, summarization, dialogue, and inference efficiency.\nBased on the experimental results, we make multiple recommendations on the\ndesign of compositional SLMs. Our code is released at\nhttps://github.com/zhaoyd1/compositional_SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6210\u5206\u53e5\u6cd5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53e5\u6cd5\u504f\u7f6e\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u53e5\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6458\u8981\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5206\u53e5\u6cd5\u6811\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u6210\u5206\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6210\u5206SLMs\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u5206SLMs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "keywords": "\u53e5\u6cd5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b, Transformer, \u6210\u5206\u53e5\u6cd5\u6811, \u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7ec4\u5408"}}

Furthermore, we\npropose a novel \"look-ahead\" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve\nmodel accuracy.

Here, we present\nChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical\nexecutor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured\naction sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to\naddress the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data.

To fill this gap, we\nintroduce MMReason, a new benchmark designed to precisely and comprehensively\nevaluate MLLM long-chain reasoning capability with diverse, open-ended,\nchallenging questions. First, we curate challenging questions requiring\nmulti-step reasoning from various fields (i.e., 6 disciplines) and multiple\ndifficulty levels (i.e., from pre-university to university, and from\nfoundational to competition tiers). Second, these questions are reformulated\ninto an open-ended format and filtered using a multi-model voting technique to\neliminate shortcut cases related to guessing and memorization, ensuring robust\nreasoning evaluations. Third, we annotate the questions with detailed\nstep-by-step solutions, and design a reference-based ternary scoring mechanism\nto reliably assess intermediate reasoning steps.

By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally\npushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain\nconfidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the\ngeographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our\napproach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it\nsignificantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while\ndelivering a significant increase in temporal resolution.

This study provides\nan in-depth investigation of QNNs for predicting the power output of a wind\nturbine. We assess the predictive performance and simulation time of six QNN\nconfigurations that are based on the Z Feature Map for data encoding and\nvarying ansatz structures. Through detailed cross-validation experiments and\ntests on an unseen hold-out dataset, we experimentally demonstrate that QNNs\ncan achieve predictive performance that is competitive with, and in some cases\nmarginally better than, the benchmarked classical approaches.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective approach called Progressive Precision Update (P$^2$U) to address this\nproblem. Instead of transmitting the original high-precision model, P$^2$U\ntransmits a lower-bit precision model, coupled with a model update representing\nthe difference between the original high-precision model and the transmitted\nlow precision version. With extensive experiments on various model\narchitectures, ranging from small models ($1 - 6$ million parameters) to a\nlarge model (more than $100$ million parameters) and using three different data\nsets, e.g., chest X-Ray, PASCAL-VOC, and CIFAR-100, we demonstrate that P$^2$U\nconsistently achieves better tradeoff between accuracy, bandwidth usage and\nlatency. Moreover, we show that when bandwidth or startup time is the priority,\naggressive quantization (e.g., 4-bit) can be used without severely compromising\nperformance. These results establish P$^2$U as an effective and practical\nsolution for scalable and efficient model distribution in low-resource\nsettings, including federated learning, edge computing, and IoT deployments.\nGiven that P$^2$U complements existing compression techniques and can be\nimplemented alongside any compression method, e.g., sparsification,\nquantization, pruning, etc., the potential for improvement is even greater.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aP$^2$U\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u8f93\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u53d1\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "P$^2$U\u4f20\u8f93\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cP$^2$U\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u6216\u542f\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u4f18\u5148\u65f6\uff0c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u91cf\u5316\uff08\u59824\u4f4d\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "P$^2$U\u662f\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\uff09\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u53d1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": "\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u53d1, \u6e10\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0, \u5e26\u5bbd\u4f18\u5316, \u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60, \u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97"}}

In this work, we propose a novel sparse autoregression framework\nfrom an interpretable machine learning perspective and the model\ninterpretability for periodicity quantification is reinforced by $\\ell_0$-norm\ninduced sparsity constraints. On the time-varying time series data, we\nreformulate the sparse autoregression and convert the involved optimization\nproblem into a mixed-integer optimization (MIO). To accelerate it, we develop a\nsubspace pursuit based decision variable pruning (DVP) strategy to reduce the\nsearch space. On the multidimensional time series that involves complicated\nspatial and temporal dimensions, we propose a spatially- and time-varying\nsparse autoregression model and resolve the corresponding MIO problem by\ndeveloping a two-stage optimization scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme\nmakes the model scalable to large problems even with millions of decision\nvariables. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the\nproposed models on real-world time series data. First, we demonstrate that the\nMIO solver can be drastically accelerated through the DVP strategy, while\nmaintaining the same solution quality as a full MIO solver. Applying the\ntime-varying sparse autoregression model to ridesharing trip data, we uncover\nboth daily and weekly periodicities and reveal long-term changes in regularity\nof human mobility.

Leveraging\na novel delta-data generation mechanism, MAPF-GPT-DDG accelerates training\nwhile significantly improving performance at test time. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that MAPF-GPT-DDG surpasses all existing learning-based MAPF\nsolvers, including the original MAPF-GPT, regarding solution quality across\nmany testing scenarios.

While recent work\nexplores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a\nrigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful\ngeneralist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via\nstandard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a\nheuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through\noffline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly\nelicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised\nfine-tuned) model without any further training.

We introduce the Barycentric Weight Layer (BWLer), which models\nthe PDE solution through barycentric polynomial interpolation. A BWLer can be\nadded on top of an existing MLP (a BWLer-hat) or replace it completely\n(explicit BWLer), cleanly separating how we represent the solution from how we\ntake derivatives for the PDE loss. Using BWLer, we identify fundamental\nprecision limitations within the MLP: on a simple 1-D interpolation task, even\nMLPs with O(1e5) parameters stall around 1e-8 RMSE -- about eight orders above\nfloat64 machine precision -- before any PDE terms are added. In PDE learning,\nadding a BWLer lifts this ceiling and exposes a tradeoff between achievable\naccuracy and the conditioning of the PDE loss. For linear PDEs we fully\ncharacterize this tradeoff with an explicit error decomposition and navigate it\nduring training with spectral derivatives and preconditioning. Across five\nbenchmark PDEs, adding a BWLer on top of an MLP improves RMSE by up to 30x for\nconvection, 10x for reaction, and 1800x for wave equations while remaining\ncompatible with first-order optimizers. Replacing the MLP entirely lets an\nexplicit BWLer reach near-machine-precision on convection, reaction, and wave\nproblems (up to 10 billion times better than prior results) and match the\nperformance of standard PINNs on stiff Burgers' and irregular-geometry Poisson\nproblems.

At its core is a hierarchical\nHopfield memory chain acting as a compositional short-term memory and dynamic\ntokenizer (retokenizer). Rather than relying on predefined tokens or\nsupervision, the model builds structure from scratch, learning symbol sequences\nas multi-scale representations. It constructs projection tensors that bind\nco-occurring features into hierarchical tokens, introducing redundancy (i.e an\nemergent gauge structure) and enabling compression of local activations into\nlong-range dependencies. Curiously, we find that the retokenizer can filter\nnatural language patterns from noise, generating synthetic languages with\ncoherent internal morphology -- quantifiably the same as human language.\nLanguage is learned in a local (Hebbian) fashion, where model constraints\ndictate allowed emergent structure, and new information is retained in\nalignment with this structure. The absence of a global objective enables a form\nof plasticity not found in conventional language models, allowing the system to\ngeneralize beyond its initial inference class -- even without explicit data. We\ndemonstrate that briefly activating a new neuron during inference binds\ndistributed multi-scale token features into a symbolic embedding. These\nemergent embedding neurons act as long-term memory and support a key-value\nmechanism for compositional inference and generalization. This architecture\nprovides a methodological foundation for studying how symbolic structure can\nemerge from local neural learning. It offers a new pathway for building\nscalable, interpretable neuro-symbolic systems -- where tokens, grammar, and\nreasoning arise as compressed memory traces within a Hopfield hierarchy.

As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously\nimproves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally,\ncreating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we\ninvestigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware\ntraining to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the\nscalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that\nTriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model\nparameters. Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite\nof TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained\nperformance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we\npropose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which\ndemonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Also,\nbuilding on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that\naccelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 times compared to\nfloating-point baselines.

To address this, this paper introduces a\nfeature-wise mixing framework to mitigate contextual bias. This was done by\nredistributing feature representations across multiple contextual datasets. To\nassess feature-wise mixing's effectiveness, four ML classifiers were trained\nusing cross-validation and evaluated with bias-sensitive loss functions,\nincluding disparity metrics and mean squared error (MSE), which served as a\nstandard measure of predictive performance. The proposed method achieved an\naverage bias reduction of 43.35% and a statistically significant decrease in\nMSE across all classifiers trained on mixed datasets. Additionally,\nbenchmarking against established bias mitigation techniques found that\nfeature-wise mixing consistently outperformed SMOTE oversampling and\ndemonstrated competitive effectiveness without requiring explicit bias\nattribute identification. Feature-wise mixing efficiently avoids the\ncomputational overhead typically associated with fairness-aware learning\nalgorithms.

Traditional\nquanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely\nbeen static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our\nresearch overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers,\nsignificantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the\nintroduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities\nin gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing\ngradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel\narchitecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging\nthe concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by\nadding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between\nquanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the\nnetwork, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide\nempirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within\nQuNNs.

This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline,\nimproving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing\nhallucinations.

In reality, what appears as a drifting causal mechanism is\noften the manifestation of a fixed underlying mechanism seen through a narrow\nobservational window. This brings about a problem that, when building a world\nmodel, even subtle shifts in policy or environment states can alter the very\nobserved causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Meta-Causal\nGraph} as world models, a minimal unified representation that efficiently\nencodes the transformation rules governing how causal structures shift across\ndifferent latent world states. A single Meta-Causal Graph is composed of\nmultiple causal subgraphs, each triggered by meta state, which is in the latent\nstate space. Building on this representation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Causality-Seeking Agent} whose objectives are to (1) identify the meta\nstates that trigger each subgraph, (2) discover the corresponding causal\nrelationships by agent curiosity-driven intervention policy, and (3)\niteratively refine the Meta-Causal Graph through ongoing curiosity-driven\nexploration and agent experiences.

We\nintroduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned\nLLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we\nfind that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling\nthe fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding\nand our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the\nratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training\ncomponent. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs\ncircumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is\nconsistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those\nwhere they do not.

Our key\ninsight is to perform joint Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on concatenated\nexpert weights, reducing conflicting parameters by extracting shared\n$U$-matrices while enabling effective merging of the expert-specific $V$\ncomponents. Specifically, Sub-MoE consists of two innovative phases: (1)\nAdaptive Expert Clustering, which groups functionally coherent experts via\nK-means clustering based on cosine similarity of expert outputs; and (2)\nSubspace Expert Merging, which first enforces Experts Union Decomposition to\nderive the shared $U$-matrix across experts in the same group, then pursues\nfrequency-based merging for individual $V$-matrices, and finalizes expert\nreconstruction using the merged $V$-matrix. In this way, we align and fuse\nexperts in a shared subspace, and can be extended with intra-expert compression\nfor further inference optimization.

This simple methodology has been\nproven effective for meticulously balanced academic benchmark datasets.\nHowever, it is not applicable to the long-tailed data distributions in the real\nworld, where it leads to the gradient imbalance issue and fails to ensure the\nBayes optimal decision rule. To address these challenges, this paper presents a\nnovel approach (BAPE) that provides a more precise theoretical estimation of\nthe data distributions by \\emph{explicitly} modeling the parameters of the\nposterior probabilities and solving them with point estimation. Consequently,\nour method directly learns the Bayes classifier without gradient descent based\non Bayes' theorem, simultaneously alleviating the gradient imbalance and\nensuring the Bayes optimal decision rule. Furthermore, we propose a\nstraightforward yet effective \\emph{distribution adjustment} technique. This\nmethod enables the Bayes classifier trained from the long-tailed training set\nto effectively adapt to the test data distribution with an arbitrary imbalance\nfactor, thereby enhancing performance without incurring additional\ncomputational costs. In addition, we demonstrate the gains of our method are\northogonal to existing learning approaches for long-tailed scenarios, as they\nare mostly designed under the principle of \\emph{implicitly} estimating the\nposterior probabilities.

However, supervised\nECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking\nfine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity\nBias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but\ninformative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence\nof SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while\nsimultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate\nit, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL\nparadigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1)\nTemporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features\nreflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this,\nMulti-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation\nlearning across dual domains, further mitigating SB.

Additive noise models (ANMs) are widely used to enable\nsample-efficient bivariate causal discovery. However, conventional ANM-based\nmethods fail when unobserved mediators corrupt the causal relationship between\nvariables. This paper makes three key contributions: first, we rigorously\ncharacterize why standard ANM approaches break down in the presence of\nunmeasured mediators. Second, we demonstrate that prior solutions for hidden\nmediation are brittle in finite sample settings, limiting their practical\nutility. To address these gaps, we propose Bivariate Denoising Diffusion (BiDD)\nfor causal discovery, a method designed to handle latent noise introduced by\nunmeasured mediators. Unlike prior methods that infer directionality through\nmean squared error loss comparisons, our approach introduces a novel\nindependence test statistic: during the noising and denoising processes for\neach variable, we condition on the other variable as input and evaluate the\nindependence of the predicted noise relative to this input. We prove asymptotic\nconsistency of BiDD under the ANM, and conjecture that it performs well under\nhidden mediation.

Recent progress in hate speech detection is\ntypically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource\nlanguages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this\nlimitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on\nlow-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -\nzero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot\nprompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to\ndetect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the\nmetaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that\nmarks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We\ninvestigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and\ncompare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,\nWord2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated\nrecurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in\nthe low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource\nlanguage - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German.

To maintain accuracy despite limited adaptation capacity, we\nintroduce a specialized loss combining three components: (1) a robust term, (2)\na frequency-domain term to preserve periodicity, and (3) a patch-wise\nstructural term for structural alignment. PETSA improves the adaptability of\nvarious forecasting backbones while requiring fewer parameters than baselines.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets show that PETSA achieves competitive\nor better performance across all horizons.

Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical.

However, modern neural networks remain systematically overconfident,\nposing risks for deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Current post-hoc\ncalibration methods face a fundamental dilemma: global approaches like\nTemperature Scaling apply uniform adjustments across all samples, introducing\nhigh bias despite computational efficiency, while more expressive methods that\noperate on full logit distributions suffer from high variance due to noisy\nhigh-dimensional inputs and insufficient validation data. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Sample Margin-Aware Recalibration of Temperature\n(SMART), a lightweight, data-efficient recalibration method that precisely\nscales logits based on the margin between the top two logits -- termed the\nlogit gap. Specifically, the logit gap serves as a denoised, scalar signal\ndirectly tied to decision boundary uncertainty, providing a robust indicator\nthat avoids the noise inherent in high-dimensional logit spaces while\npreserving model prediction invariance.

Extensive evaluations across\ndiverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that SMART achieves\nstate-of-the-art calibration performance even with substantially fewer\nparameters compared to existing parametric methods, offering a principled,\nrobust, and highly efficient solution for practical uncertainty quantification\nin neural network predictions.

Recently, with the development of Diffusion-based Dense Prediction\n(DDP) models, the exploration of DA designs tailored to this framework is worth\nexploring, since the diffusion model is effective in modeling the distribution\ntransformation that comprises domain information. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free mechanism for DDP frameworks, endowing them with DA capabilities.\nOur motivation arises from the observation that the exposure bias (e.g., noise\nstatistics bias) in diffusion brings domain shift, and different domains in\nconditions of DDP models can also be effectively captured by the noise\nprediction statistics. Based on this, we propose a training-free Domain Noise\nAlignment (DNA) approach, which alleviates the variations of noise statistics\nto domain changes during the diffusion sampling process, thereby achieving\ndomain adaptation. Specifically, when the source domain is available, we\ndirectly adopt the DNA method to achieve domain adaptation by aligning the\nnoise statistics of the target domain with those of the source domain. For the\nmore challenging source-free DA, inspired by the observation that regions\ncloser to the source domain exhibit higher confidence meeting variations of\nsampling noise, we utilize the statistics from the high-confidence regions\nprogressively to guide the noise statistic adjustment during the sampling\nprocess. Notably, our method demonstrates the effectiveness of enhancing the DA\ncapability of DDP models across four common dense prediction tasks.

The study further\nassesses how AI interventions shape student engagement, foster discovery\ncuriosity, and enhance team performance within the IMD learning environment.\nUsing a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, a human experimenter dynamically adjusts the AI\ntutor teammate's behavior through a large language model. By employing a\nmixed-methods exploratory design, a total of 11 high school students\nparticipated in four IMD tasks that involved molecular visualization and\ncalculations, which increased in complexity over a 60-minute period.

Cross Recurrence Quantification\nAnalysis (CRQA) metrics reflected structural alignment in coordination and were\nlinked to communication behaviors. High-performing teams exhibited superior\ntask completion, deeper understanding, and increased engagement.

To mitigate this issue, trace clustering techniques group process\nexecutions into clusters, each represented by a simpler and more understandable\nprocess model. Model-driven trace clustering improves on this by assigning\ntraces to clusters based on their conformity to cluster-specific process\nmodels. However, most existing clustering techniques rely on either no process\nmodel discovery, or non-stochastic models, neglecting the frequency or\nprobability of activities and transitions, thereby limiting their capability to\ncapture real-world execution dynamics. We propose a novel model-driven trace\nclustering method that optimizes stochastic process models within each cluster.\nOur approach uses entropic relevance, a stochastic conformance metric based on\ndirectly-follows probabilities, to guide trace assignment.

Our work provides a scalable framework for\nlinking document embeddings to scientometric outcomes and highlights new\nquestions regarding the role that semantic similarity plays in shaping the\ndynamics of scientific reward.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u5f15\u7528\u7387\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5f15\u7528\u7387\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u79d1\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7ee7\u627f\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8bba\u6587\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5b66\u672f\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08\u03c1\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u03b1\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u679053,000\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5c42\u6b21\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5f15\u7528\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5f15\u7528\u7387\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6307\u6807\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5468\u56f4\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "keywords": "\u79d1\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u7387\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027"}}

We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work\nin these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary\nChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with\ntwo-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in\nthree similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users.

However, these approaches often lack\ngeneralizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in\nineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently\nbut also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we\npropose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method\nthat identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed\ntests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety.\nSpecifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint\nheads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving\nenvironment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate\nadaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety\nidentification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse\nannotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and\nothers as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to\nmitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat\nconservative mitigation strategies.

These problems hinder fair comparisons\nbetween TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for\nevaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7\nonline TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates\nthem across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on\nCLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid\nloss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA\nto assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates\nvarious evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration,\nout-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic\nassessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1)\nexisting TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering\nwork; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time\nfine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced\nmodel trustworthiness.

This separate\nencoding fails to bridge the modality gap effectively, and more critically,\nthese methods struggle with the sparsity and noise of single-frame LiDAR, often\nrequiring point cloud accumulation or additional priors to improve reliability.\nInspired by recent progress in detector-free matching paradigms (e.g.\nMatchAnything), we revisit the projection-based approach and introduce the\ndetector-free framework for direct point-pixel matching between LiDAR and\ncamera views. Specifically, we project the LiDAR intensity map into a 2D view\nfrom the LiDAR perspective and feed it into an attention-based detector-free\nmatching network, enabling cross-modal correspondence estimation without\nrelying on multi-frame accumulation. To further enhance matching reliability,\nwe introduce a repeatability scoring mechanism that acts as a soft visibility\nprior.

Properties\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\ndatasets.

The\nmassively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is\nideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most\ndemanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTriADA\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728HPC\u548cAI\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "TriADA\u91c7\u75281)\u4f4e\u79e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u74063D\u79bb\u6563\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c2)\u4e13\u7528\u4e8e3D-GEMT\u7684\u5916\u79efGEMM\u5185\u6838\uff0c3)\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f3D\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c4)\u5f39\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u5916\u79ef\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "TriADA\u80fd\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u7b97\u672f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e09\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "TriADA\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fAI\u548cHPC\u4e2d\u6700\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u591a\u7ebf\u6027\u5f20\u91cf\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002", "keywords": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e,\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97,\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387,3D\u79bb\u6563\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362,\u5f39\u6027\u7a00\u758f\u5916\u79ef"}}

In this work, we propose\na method for training a masking network to perform binary object segmentation\nusing weak supervision in the form of image-wise presence or absence of an\nobject of interest, which provides less information but may be obtained more\nquickly from manual or automatic labeling. A key step in our method is that the\nsegmented objects can be placed into background-only images to create\nrealistic, images of the objects with counterfactual backgrounds. To create a\ncontrast between the original and counterfactual background images, we propose\nto first cluster the background-only images, and then during learning create\ncounterfactual images that blend objects segmented from their original source\nbackgrounds to backgrounds chosen from a targeted cluster. One term in the\ntraining loss is the divergence between these counterfactual images and the\nreal object images with backgrounds of the target cluster. The other term is a\nsupervised loss for background-only images. While an adversarial critic could\nprovide the divergence, we use sample-based divergences.

Our aim is to concatenate a stack 2D free-breathing\nreal-time cines and use Deep Learning (DL) to create an isotropic a fully\nsegmented 3D cine dataset from these images. Methods: Four DL models were\ntrained on open-source data that performed: a) Interslice contrast correction;\nb) Interslice respiratory motion correction; c) Super-resolution (slice\ndirection); and d) Segmentation of right and left atria and ventricles (RA, LA,\nRV, and LV), thoracic aorta (Ao) and pulmonary arteries (PA). In 10 patients\nundergoing routine cardiovascular examination, our method was validated on\nprospectively acquired sagittal stacks of real-time cine images. Quantitative\nmetrics (ventricular volumes and vessel diameters) and image quality of the 3D\ncines were compared to conventional breath hold cine and whole heart imaging.\nResults: All real-time data were successfully transformed into 3D cines with a\ntotal post-processing time of <1 min in all cases.

There is also reasonable agreement for all vessel diameters,\nalthough there was a small but significant overestimation of RPA diameter.\nConclusion: We have demonstrated the potential of creating a 3D-cine data from\nconcatenated 2D real-time cine images using a series of DL models.

A skillful climate model should capture both stationary\nstatistics and responses to external perturbations. While current\nautoregressive neural models often reproduce the former, they typically\nstruggle with the latter. We begin by analyzing a low-dimensional dynamical\nsystem to expose, by analogy, fundamental limitations that persist in\nhigh-dimensional settings. Specifically, we construct neural stochastic models\nunder two scenarios: one where the full state vector is observed, and another\nwith only partial observations (i.e. a subset of variables). In the first case,\nthe models accurately capture both equilibrium statistics and forced responses\nin ensemble mean and variance. In the more realistic case of partial\nobservations, two key challenges emerge: (i) identifying the \\textit{proper}\nvariables to model, and (ii) parameterizing the influence of unobserved degrees\nof freedom.

Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy\nfunctions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann\ndistributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5ASBS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Adjoint Matching\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "ASBS\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u80fd\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6784\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "ASBS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "keywords": "\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837, \u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865, \u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236, \u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03"}}

Traditionally, these models use\nsurface meshes, which pose challenges in efficiently handling interactions with\nother geometric entities, such as objects and scenes, typically represented as\nmeshes or point clouds. To address this limitation, recent research has\nexplored volumetric neural implicit body models. However, existing works are\neither insufficiently robust for complex human articulations or impose high\ncomputational and memory costs, limiting their widespread use. To this end, we\nintroduce VolumetricSMPL, a neural volumetric body model that leverages Neural\nBlend Weights (NBW) to generate compact, yet efficient MLP decoders. Unlike\nprior approaches that rely on large MLPs, NBW dynamically blends a small set of\nlearned weight matrices using predicted shape- and pose-dependent coefficients,\nsignificantly improving computational efficiency while preserving\nexpressiveness. VolumetricSMPL outperforms prior volumetric occupancy model\nCOAP with 10x faster inference, 6x lower GPU memory usage, enhanced accuracy,\nand a Signed Distance Function (SDF) for efficient and differentiable contact\nmodeling. We demonstrate VolumetricSMPL's strengths across four challenging\ntasks: (1) reconstructing human-object interactions from in-the-wild images,\n(2) recovering human meshes in 3D scenes from egocentric views, (3)\nscene-constrained motion synthesis, and (4) resolving self-intersections.

Despite their advancements, the explainability of MLLMs remains less\nexplored, hindering deeper understanding, model credibility, and effective\nvisualization. Unlike conventional vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, CLIP) that\nproduce a single output, MLLMs generate sequences of tokens progressively,\nwhere each generated token depends on the previous context.

Existing attempts to accelerate\nINR encoding often sacrifice reconstruction quality or crucial coordinate-level\ncontrol essential for adaptive streaming and transcoding. We introduce SIEDD\n(Shared-Implicit Encoder with Discrete Decoders), a novel architecture that\nfundamentally accelerates INR encoding without these compromises. SIEDD first\nrapidly trains a shared, coordinate-based encoder on sparse anchor frames to\nefficiently capture global, low-frequency video features. This encoder is then\nfrozen, enabling massively parallel training of lightweight, discrete decoders\nfor individual frame groups, further expedited by aggressive coordinate-space\nsampling. This synergistic design delivers a remarkable 20-30X encoding\nspeed-up over state-of-the-art INR codecs on HD and 4K benchmarks, while\nmaintaining competitive reconstruction quality and compression ratios.\nCritically, SIEDD retains full coordinate-based control, enabling continuous\nresolution decoding and eliminating costly transcoding.

Deciding on the document presentation lengths in a\nfixed vertical space ranking is an important problem that has not been\naddressed by existing LTR methods.\n  We address this gap by introducing the variable presentation length ranking\ntask, where simultaneously the ordering of documents and their presentation\nlength is decided. Despite being a generalization of standard ranking, we show\nthat this setting brings significant new challenges: Firstly, the probability\nranking principle no longer applies to this setting, and secondly, the problem\ncannot be divided into separate ordering and length selection tasks.\n  We therefore propose VLPL - a new family of Plackett-Luce list-wise gradient\nestimation methods for the joint optimization of document ordering and lengths.\nOur semi-synthetic experiments show that VLPL can effectively balance the\nexpected exposure and attractiveness of all documents, achieving the best\nperformance across different ranking settings. Furthermore, we observe that\neven simple length-aware methods can achieve significant performance\nimprovements over fixed-length models. Altogether, our theoretical and\nempirical results highlight the importance and difficulties of combining\ndocument presentation with LTR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u53d8\u5c55\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u6392\u540d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LTR\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5c55\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u5c55\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\u800c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709LTR\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLPL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePlackett-Luce\u5217\u8868\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u6863\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0e\u5c55\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eVLPL\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u6587\u6863\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u5ea6\u548c\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u6863\u5c55\u793a\u4e0eLTR\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0cVLPL\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "keywords": "Learning to Rank, \u53ef\u53d8\u5c55\u793a\u957f\u5ea6, VLPL, \u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316"}}

Conventional object\ndetection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's\nability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nobjects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to\ndetect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous\nsituations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection\napproach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification\nto object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their\nspecific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless'\nbased on whether they pose a danger to the AV.

The aim of TAMP is to restore a damaged target image\nby leveraging the complementary information from a reference image, where both\nimages captured the same scene but with a significant time gap in between,\ni.e., time-variant images. Different from conventional reference-guided image\ninpainting, the reference image under TAMP setup presents significant content\ndistinction to the target image and potentially also suffers from damages. Such\nan application frequently happens in our daily lives to restore a damaged image\nby referring to another reference image, where there is no guarantee of the\nreference image's source and quality. In particular, our study finds that even\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) reference-guided image inpainting methods fail to\nachieve plausible results due to the chaotic image complementation. To address\nsuch an ill-posed problem, we propose a novel Interactive Distribution\nTransition Estimation (InDiTE) module which interactively complements the\ntime-variant images with adaptive semantics thus facilitate the restoration of\ndamaged regions. To further boost the performance, we propose our TAMP\nsolution, namely Interactive Distribution Transition Estimation-driven\nDiffusion (InDiTE-Diff), which integrates InDiTE with SOTA diffusion model and\nconducts latent cross-reference during sampling. Moreover, considering the lack\nof benchmarks for TAMP task, we newly assembled a dataset, i.e., TAMP-Street,\nbased on existing image and mask datasets.

However,\nlarge-scale datasets, specially those constructed from crowd-sourcing and\nweb-scraping, often suffer from label noise, inconsistencies, and errors. This\nproblem is particularly pronounced in manufacturing domains, where obtaining\nhigh-quality labels is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces\nVision-Language Sanitization and Refinement (VLSR), which is a\nvision-language-based framework for label sanitization and refinement in\nmulti-label manufacturing image datasets. This method embeds both images and\ntheir associated textual labels into a shared semantic space leveraging the\nCLIP vision-language model. Then two key tasks are addressed in this process by\ncomputing the cosine similarity between embeddings. First, label sanitization\nis performed to identify irrelevant, misspelled, or semantically weak labels,\nand surface the most semantically aligned label for each image by comparing\nimage-label pairs using cosine similarity between image and label embeddings.\nSecond, the method applies density-based clustering on text embeddings,\nfollowed by iterative cluster merging, to group semantically similar labels\ninto unified label groups.

To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring\nsystems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and\nprogression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in\nstructural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate\nquantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial\nintelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring\nconsists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3)\nlung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification\nand reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per\nsubject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring.\nAdditionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate\n(p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973,\np=5.85e-9).

Existing approaches for multi-robot\nrelative localization often depend on costly or short-range sensors like\ncameras and LiDARs. Consequently, these approaches face challenges such as high\ncomputational overhead (e.g., map merging) and difficulties in disjoint\nenvironments. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MGPRL, a novel\ndistributed framework for multi-robot relative localization using convex-hull\nof multiple Wi-Fi access points (AP). To accomplish this, we employ\nco-regionalized multi-output Gaussian Processes for efficient Radio Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) field prediction and perform uncertainty-aware\nmulti-AP localization, which is further coupled with weighted convex hull-based\nalignment for robust relative pose estimation. Each robot predicts the RSSI\nfield of the environment by an online scan of APs in its environment, which are\nutilized for position estimation of multiple APs. To perform relative\nlocalization, each robot aligns the convex hull of its predicted AP locations\nwith that of the neighbor robots. This approach is well-suited for devices with\nlimited computational resources and operates solely on widely available Wi-Fi\nRSSI measurements without necessitating any dedicated pre-calibration or\noffline fingerprinting. We rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed\nMGPRL in ROS simulations and demonstrate it with real-world experiments,\ncomparing it against multiple state-of-the-art approaches. The results showcase\nthat MGPRL outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency.

As\na result, conventional robotic systems are often unable to provide effective\nescorting services due to their limited understanding of human movement\ndynamics. To address these challenges, an effective escorting robot must\ncontinuously detect and interpret human actions during the escorting process\nand adjust its movement accordingly. However, there is currently no existing\ndataset designed specifically for human action detection in the context of\nescorting. Given that escorting often occurs in crowded environments, where\nother individuals may enter the robot's camera view, the robot also needs to\nidentify the specific human it is escorting (the subject) before predicting\ntheir actions. Since no existing model performs both person re-identification\nand action prediction in real-time, we propose a novel neural network\narchitecture that can accomplish both tasks.

However, existing ML-based TE schemes remain impractical: they\neither fail to handle topology changes or suffer from poor scalability due to\nexcessive computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Geminet, a lightweight and scalable ML-based TE framework that can\nhandle changing topologies. Geminet is built upon two key insights: (i) a\nmethodology that decouples neural networks from topology by learning an\niterative gradient-descent-based adjustment process, as the update rule of\ngradient descent is topology-agnostic, relying only on a few gradient-related\nquantities; (ii) shifting optimization from path-level routing weights to\nedge-level dual variables, reducing memory consumption by leveraging the fact\nthat edges are far fewer than paths. Evaluations on WAN and data center\ndatasets show that Geminet significantly improves scalability. Its neural\nnetwork size is only 0.04% to 7% of existing schemes, while handling topology\nvariations as effectively as HARP, a state-of-the-art ML-based TE approach,\nwithout performance degradation.

However, with\nmore bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to\nthe point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on\nthe insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra\nbits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit\nallocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise\nallocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and\naccuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and\nthe bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable\nthrough gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths\nand temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle\ndifferent temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal\nlengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically\nformulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may\nincur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size\nrenewal mechanism to alleviate this issue.

In this paper, we propose\nan efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity\nVision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a\nlightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each\nmodality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate\nmodality-specific learnable prompt vectors.

Finally, the fused\nrepresentations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target\nlocalization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking\nbenchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e.,\nFE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the\nproposed tracking framework.

We\nconsider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the\ntime--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL\nthrough normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although\nNT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks\nto weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence\ntokens.

However, to date, existing TTA methods primarily focus\non single-model adaptation. In this work, we investigate an intriguing\nquestion: how does cross-model knowledge influence the TTA process? Our\nfindings reveal that, in TTA's unsupervised online setting, each model can\nprovide complementary, confident knowledge to the others, even when there are\nsubstantial differences in model size. For instance, a smaller model like\nMobileViT (10.6M parameters) can effectively guide a larger model like ViT-Base\n(86.6M parameters). In light of this, we propose COCA, a Cross-Model\nCo-Learning framework for TTA, which mainly consists of two main strategies. 1)\nCo-adaptation adaptively integrates complementary knowledge from other models\nthroughout the TTA process, reducing individual model biases. 2)\nSelf-adaptation enhances each model's unique strengths via unsupervised\nlearning, enabling diverse adaptation to the target domain.

However, their proficiency in these high-level applications\noften assumes a deep understanding of low-level physical prerequisites, a\ncapability that remains largely unverified. For robots to perform actions\nreliably, they must comprehend intrinsic object properties (e.g., material,\nweight), action affordances (e.g., graspable, stackable), and physical\nconstraints (e.g., stability, reachability, or an object's state, such as being\nclosed).
