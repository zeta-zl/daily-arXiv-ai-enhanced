In\nthis paper, we introduce Alternating Gradient Flows (AGF), an algorithmic\nframework that describes the dynamics of feature learning in two-layer networks\ntrained from small initialization. Prior works have shown that gradient flow in\nthis regime exhibits a staircase-like loss curve, alternating between plateaus\nwhere neurons slowly align to useful directions and sharp drops where neurons\nrapidly grow in norm. AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step\nprocess: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a\ncost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each\nround, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and\na drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these\ndrops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and\nextends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks\nand attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular\nmodes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we\nprove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.\nApplying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give\nthe first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that\nnetworks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.\nAltogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning\nin neural networks."}

Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using\nlightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We\nprovide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance\nmetrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we\noutline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive\nmodel selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across\nheterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and\naccessible for real world applications."}

On the basis of the traditional\nDRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid\narchitecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can\ndynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system\nindicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery\nstrategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic\nmatching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The\ninnovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment\nmodeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration\nefficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same\ntime, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with\nreinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve\ncontinuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting.\nExperimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared\nwith the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system\nrecovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios."}

While notable progress has been made in\ntranslating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved\naway from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing\nefforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,\nincrease parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,\nthe application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces\nsimilar challenges.\n  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that\nachieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention\nmechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard\ntraining procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for\nexplicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical\ntop-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that\navoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard\ntop-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN\nparameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for\nidentifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from\nenforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the\nGemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on\nstandard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN\nneurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens.

In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative\nvariant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and\nAsymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution\nto favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and\nempirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across\nvarious cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost\nand smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to\n40% in some settings."}

Such assumptions may not hold in practice and\ncan lead to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose MATI:\nMixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular\nImbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware\nMixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying\nrelated regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then\nused to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique\ncharacteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised\nExpert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on\ntest data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test\ndistributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance\nregression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.\nTo reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test\ndistributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a\nnormal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution\nthat emphasizes rare target regions. On average across these three test\ndistributions, MATI achieved a 7.1% improvement in MAE compared to existing\nmethods."}

However, their ability to attend to truly critical\ninformation during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the\npace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting\npatterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing\nthese patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation\nquality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training\ndata, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal\ninstruction-response relationships.

To\nmitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus\n(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding\nfactors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an\nadvanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal\nrelationships in the training corpus.

Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets,\nDISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in\nboth token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our\nablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly\nenhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query\ntypes, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document\nrepresentation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly\navailable at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research."}

Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing\nenergy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of\nconverting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of\nenergy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face\ndifficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.\nPrevious research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the\nenergy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of\nP2G.\n  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be\napplied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and\ngas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex\ncase studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep\nQ-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to\nenhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,\nimplementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost\ncalculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards.

We therefore introduce the\nconcept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit\n(neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented\nquery parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated\ngeneration. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce\nFAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068\nproblems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nsetups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination\nbenchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the\nfundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on\nFAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for\nstate-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or\nmisinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an\nautomatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting\nintent hallucination.

To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)\nmetric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly\nenhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across\nlocomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most\nstitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing\nthe previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0.

The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,\ncorresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective\nnuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled\nrepresentation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification\nor loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei\nsegmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the\nstain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color\nappearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.\nThe proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for\nsegmentation of nuclei regions from histological images.

The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random\nside information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens.\nLLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks -\nsuch as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this\npaper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is\nto understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to\nmaximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of\ngenerated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:\nHeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully\ntrading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion.

This problem is critical as LLMs\nincreasingly participate in complex human-AI collaborations, where fair\ncompensation and accountability rely on effective pricing mechanisms. Inspired\nby how human societies address similar coordination challenges (e.g., through\ntemporary collaborations such as employment or subcontracting), we propose a\ncooperative workflow, Shapley-Coop. Shapley-Coop integrates Shapley\nChain-of-Thought -- leveraging marginal contributions as a principled basis for\npricing -- with structured negotiation protocols for effective price matching,\nenabling LLM agents to coordinate through rational task-time pricing and\npost-task reward redistribution. This approach aligns agent incentives, fosters\ncooperation, and maintains autonomy. We evaluate Shapley-Coop across two\nmulti-agent games and a software engineering simulation, demonstrating that it\nconsistently enhances LLM agent collaboration and facilitates equitable credit\nassignment. These results highlight the effectiveness of Shapley-Coop's pricing\nmechanisms in accurately reflecting individual contributions during task\nexecution."}

The sample-level CGD is statistically upper\nbounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total\nnumber of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the\ndevice-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it\ninto the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution\nand the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the\nsum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within\npolynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases\nclassification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\\% while scheduling\n41.8\\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing\nsampling variance."}
