### [1] [Rosetta-PL: Propositional Logic as a Benchmark for Large Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00001)
*Shaun Baek,Shaun Esua-Mensah,Cyrus Tsui,Sejan Vigneswaralingam,Abdullah Alali,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为Rosetta-PL的基准测试，用于评估LLMs在低资源和逻辑推理任务中的表现。通过将Lean的逻辑命题数据集翻译成自定义逻辑语言并微调LLM，研究发现翻译过程中保留逻辑关系能显著提升精确度，且在约2万个训练样本后性能趋于稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要基于高资源自然语言训练，在低资源环境和深度逻辑推理任务中表现有限，因此需要探索优化其在这些场景下的能力。

Method: 使用Lean的逻辑命题数据集，将其翻译为自定义逻辑语言，并微调LLM（如GPT-4o），分析数据集规模和翻译方法对模型性能的影响。

Result: 翻译过程中保留逻辑关系显著提高了精确度，且模型性能在约2万个训练样本后趋于稳定。

Conclusion: 研究结果为优化LLM在形式推理任务中的训练提供了指导，并有助于提升低资源语言应用的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are primarily trained on high-resource natural
languages, limiting their effectiveness in low-resource settings and in tasks
requiring deep logical reasoning. This research introduces Rosetta-PL, a
benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' logical reasoning and generalization
capabilities in a controlled environment. We construct Rosetta-PL by
translating a dataset of logical propositions from Lean into a custom logical
language, which is then used to fine-tune an LLM (e.g., GPT-4o). Our
experiments analyze the impact of the size of the dataset and the translation
methodology on the performance of the model. Our results indicate that
preserving logical relationships in the translation process significantly
boosts precision, with accuracy plateauing beyond roughly 20,000 training
samples. These insights provide valuable guidelines for optimizing LLM training
in formal reasoning tasks and improving performance in various low-resource
language applications.

### [2] [Symbol grounding in computational systems: A paradox of intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00002)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出计算主义无法解释符号接地问题，因为无论计算基于有意义还是无意义的符号，都会导致语义先天论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示计算主义在解释心智过程中的根本矛盾，尤其是符号接地这一关键问题。

Method: 通过逻辑分析，探讨计算主义的两难困境：心智计算基于有意义或无意义符号的两种可能及其后果。

Result: 无论计算基于何种符号，计算主义都无法避免语义先天论的结论，表明其无法解决符号接地问题。

Conclusion: 计算主义作为解释心智的理论存在根本缺陷，尤其在符号接地问题上无法自圆其说。

Abstract: The paper presents a paradoxical feature of computational systems that
suggests that computationalism cannot explain symbol grounding. If the mind is
a digital computer, as computationalism claims, then it can be computing either
over meaningful symbols or over meaningless symbols. If it is computing over
meaningful symbols its functioning presupposes the existence of meaningful
symbols in the system, i.e. it implies semantic nativism. If the mind is
computing over meaningless symbols, no intentional cognitive processes are
available prior to symbol grounding. In this case, no symbol grounding could
take place since any grounding presupposes intentional cognitive processes. So,
whether computing in the mind is over meaningless or over meaningful symbols,
computationalism implies semantic nativism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型规模和复杂度的增长，心理学被认为是实现类人认知、行为与互动的关键。本文旨在通过心理学视角填补当前NLP研究的空白。

Method: 整合认知、发展、行为、社会、人格心理学及心理语言学的理论，分析其在NLP开发各阶段的应用现状与不足。

Result: 揭示了心理学理论在NLP中的现有应用趋势与脱节点，提出了跨领域结合的潜在方向。

Conclusion: 倡导心理学与NLP更深入的融合，以推动未来研究的跨学科整合。

Abstract: Psychological insights have long shaped pivotal NLP breakthroughs, including
the cognitive underpinnings of attention mechanisms, formative reinforcement
learning, and Theory of Mind-inspired social modeling. As Large Language Models
(LLMs) continue to grow in scale and complexity, there is a rising consensus
that psychology is essential for capturing human-like cognition, behavior, and
interaction. This paper reviews how psychological theories can inform and
enhance stages of LLM development, including data, pre-training, post-training,
and evaluation\&application. Our survey integrates insights from cognitive,
developmental, behavioral, social, personality psychology, and
psycholinguistics. Our analysis highlights current trends and gaps in how
psychological theories are applied. By examining both cross-domain connections
and points of tension, we aim to bridge disciplinary divides and promote more
thoughtful integration of psychology into future NLP research.

### [4] [LangVAE and LangSpace: Building and Probing for Language Model VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00004)
*Danilo S. Carvalho,Yingji Zhang,Harriet Unsworth,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangVAE是一个基于预训练大型语言模型构建变分自编码器的新框架，旨在生成更紧凑且语义解耦的表示，并提供分析工具LangSpace。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在利用预训练语言模型的知识构建更高效、解耦的文本表示，并系统化实验与理解。

Method: 通过模块化构建VAE，结合LangSpace的分析工具（如向量插值、解耦度量），并实验不同编码器-解码器组合。

Result: 实验展示了框架在不同架构和规模下的通用性与解耦效果。

Conclusion: LangVAE为文本表示的系统化实验与理解提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: We present LangVAE, a novel framework for modular construction of variational
autoencoders (VAEs) on top of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). Such
language model VAEs can encode the knowledge of their pre-trained components
into more compact and semantically disentangled representations. The
representations obtained in this way can be analysed with the LangVAE companion
framework: LangSpace, which implements a collection of probing methods, such as
vector traversal and interpolation, disentanglement measures, and cluster
visualisations. LangVAE and LangSpace offer a flexible, efficient and scalable
way of building and analysing textual representations, with simple integration
for models available on the HuggingFace Hub. Additionally, we conducted a set
of experiments with different encoder and decoder combinations, as well as
annotated inputs, revealing a wide range of interactions across architectural
families and sizes w.r.t. generalisation and disentanglement. Our findings
demonstrate a promising framework for systematising the experimentation and
understanding of textual representations.

### [5] [Toward a digital twin of U.S. Congress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00006)
*Hayden Helm,Tianyi Chen,Harvey McGuinness,Paige Lee,Brandon Duderstadt,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过语言模型构建美国国会议员的虚拟模型，证明其符合数字孪生的定义，并展示如何利用生成的推文预测投票行为和跨党概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证语言模型是否能构建国会议员的数字孪生，并探索其对立法动态的实际影响。

Method: 使用每日更新的国会议员推文数据集，训练特定于个人的语言模型生成推文。

Result: 生成的推文与真实推文难以区分，并可预测投票行为和跨党概率。

Conclusion: 研究展示了数字孪生在政治分析中的潜力，但需进一步扩展和解决局限性。

Abstract: In this paper we provide evidence that a virtual model of U.S.
congresspersons based on a collection of language models satisfies the
definition of a digital twin. In particular, we introduce and provide
high-level descriptions of a daily-updated dataset that contains every Tweet
from every U.S. congressperson during their respective terms. We demonstrate
that a modern language model equipped with congressperson-specific subsets of
this data are capable of producing Tweets that are largely indistinguishable
from actual Tweets posted by their physical counterparts. We illustrate how
generated Tweets can be used to predict roll-call vote behaviors and to
quantify the likelihood of congresspersons crossing party lines, thereby
assisting stakeholders in allocating resources and potentially impacting
real-world legislative dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the
limitations and important extensions of our analysis.

### [7] [Efficient Knowledge Transfer in Multi-Task Learning through Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00009)
*Xiao Zhang,Kangsheng Wang,Tianyu Hu,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TA-LoRA是一种基于提示调优的多任务学习方法，通过低秩表示建模任务异构性，并采用快慢权重机制分离共享与任务特定知识，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型在面对新任务时表现不佳，而传统的多任务学习和提示调优方法难以有效捕捉任务异构性。TA-LoRA旨在通过低秩表示和快慢权重机制解决这一问题。

Method: TA-LoRA结合了低秩表示和快慢权重机制，慢权重编码共享知识，快权重捕捉任务特定知识，并通过零初始化注意力机制减少初始化阶段的干扰。

Result: 在16个任务上的实验表明，TA-LoRA在完全数据和少样本设置下均达到最先进性能，且保持了优异的参数效率。

Conclusion: TA-LoRA通过高效建模任务异构性，显著提升了多任务学习的效果，是预训练语言模型适应新任务的有效方法。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrate remarkable intelligence but
struggle with emerging tasks unseen during training in real-world applications.
Training separate models for each new task is usually impractical. Multi-task
learning (MTL) addresses this challenge by transferring shared knowledge from
source tasks to target tasks. As an dominant parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method, prompt tuning (PT) enhances MTL by introducing an adaptable vector that
captures task-specific knowledge, which acts as a prefix to the original prompt
that preserves shared knowledge, while keeping PLM parameters frozen. However,
PT struggles to effectively capture the heterogeneity of task-specific
knowledge due to its limited representational capacity. To address this
challenge, we propose Task-Adaptive Low-Rank Representation (TA-LoRA), an MTL
method built on PT, employing the low-rank representation to model task
heterogeneity and a fast-slow weights mechanism where the slow weight encodes
shared knowledge, while the fast weight captures task-specific nuances,
avoiding the mixing of shared and task-specific knowledge, caused by training
low-rank representations from scratch. Moreover, a zero-initialized attention
mechanism is introduced to minimize the disruption of immature low-rank
components on original prompts during warm-up epochs. Experiments on 16 tasks
demonstrate that TA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in full-data and
few-shot settings while maintaining superior parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析LLM中的越狱行为，提出基于语言特征的预测模型，显著优于Prompt Engineering方法，尤以模糊决策树表现最佳，为教育领域LLM的安全使用提供了可解释的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在教育等敏感领域的应用因越狱行为（绕过伦理限制）而面临安全隐患，需开发有效的检测方法以确保安全使用。

Method: 研究标注了2,300条来自临床教育平台2-Sigma的对话提示，提取4个与越狱行为强相关的语言特征，并训练决策树、模糊逻辑分类器、提升方法及逻辑回归等模型。

Result: 基于特征的模型（尤其是模糊决策树）在检测越狱行为上 consistently 优于 Prompt Engineering，且具有更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: 语言特征模型是检测LLM越狱行为的有效方案，未来可探索结合提示灵活性与规则鲁棒性的混合框架，实现实时监控。

Abstract: Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) threatens their safe use in
sensitive domains like education by allowing users to bypass ethical
safeguards. This study focuses on detecting jailbreaks in 2-Sigma, a clinical
education platform that simulates patient interactions using LLMs. We annotated
over 2,300 prompts across 158 conversations using four linguistic variables
shown to correlate strongly with jailbreak behavior. The extracted features
were used to train several predictive models, including Decision Trees, Fuzzy
Logic-based classifiers, Boosting methods, and Logistic Regression. Results
show that feature-based predictive models consistently outperformed Prompt
Engineering, with the Fuzzy Decision Tree achieving the best overall
performance. Our findings demonstrate that linguistic-feature-based models are
effective and explainable alternatives for jailbreak detection. We suggest
future work explore hybrid frameworks that integrate prompt-based flexibility
with rule-based robustness for real-time, spectrum-based jailbreak monitoring
in educational LLMs.

### [10] [Performance Evaluation of Emotion Classification in Japanese Using RoBERTa and DeBERTa](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00013)
*Yoichi Takenaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究针对日语文本情感检测的资源匮乏和类别不平衡问题，通过微调预训练模型，最终确定DeBERTa-v3-large模型表现最佳，并发布了相关工具包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语文本情感检测在实际应用中需求高，但面临资源匮乏和类别不平衡问题，需要高准确率的模型。

Method: 使用WRIME语料库，将读者平均强度分数转化为二元标签，并微调BERT、RoBERTa、DeBERTa-v3-base和DeBERTa-v3-large四种预训练语言模型。同时评估两种大型语言模型。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-large表现最佳，平均准确率0.860，F1分数0.662，优于其他模型。大型语言模型表现较差。

Conclusion: 微调的DeBERTa-v3-large模型是目前日语二元情感分类的最可靠解决方案，未来需增强稀有情感数据并优化模型。

Abstract: Background Practical applications such as social media monitoring and
customer-feedback analysis require accurate emotion detection for Japanese
text, yet resource scarcity and class imbalance hinder model performance.
  Objective This study aims to build a high-accuracy model for predicting the
presence or absence of eight Plutchik emotions in Japanese sentences.
  Methods Using the WRIME corpus, we transform reader-averaged intensity scores
into binary labels and fine-tune four pre-trained language models (BERT,
RoBERTa, DeBERTa-v3-base, DeBERTa-v3-large). For context, we also assess two
large language models (TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct and ChatGPT-4o). Accuracy and
F1-score serve as evaluation metrics.
  Results DeBERTa-v3-large attains the best mean accuracy (0.860) and F1-score
(0.662), outperforming all other models. It maintains robust F1 across both
high-frequency emotions (e.g., Joy, Anticipation) and low-frequency emotions
(e.g., Anger, Trust). The LLMs lag, with ChatGPT-4o and
TinySwallow-1.5B-Instruct scoring 0.527 and 0.292 in mean F1, respectively.
  Conclusion The fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large model currently offers the most
reliable solution for binary emotion classification in Japanese. We release
this model as a pip-installable package (pip install
deberta-emotion-predictor). Future work should augment data for rare emotions,
reduce model size, and explore prompt engineering to improve LLM performance.
  This manuscript is under review for possible publication in New Generation
Computing.

### [11] [Manifold-Constrained Sentence Embeddings via Triplet Loss: Projecting Semantics onto Spheres, Tori, and Möbius Strips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00014)
*Vinit K. Chavan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过将句子嵌入限制在连续流形（单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带）上，利用三重损失函数训练，显著提升了语义表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入在无约束欧几里得空间中可能无法有效捕捉语言的复杂关系，流形约束能更好地反映语义结构。

Method: 采用三重损失函数，将嵌入约束在单位球面、环面和莫比乌斯带等流形上，利用微分几何限制输出空间。

Result: 在AG News和MBTI数据集上，流形约束嵌入（尤其是球面和莫比乌斯带）在聚类质量（轮廓分数）和分类性能（准确率）上均优于传统方法（TF-IDF、Word2Vec等）。

Conclusion: 流形空间的嵌入通过拓扑结构与语义分离的互补，为NLP中的几何表示学习提供了新的数学基础方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning have emphasized the role of
embedding geometry in capturing semantic structure. Traditional sentence
embeddings typically reside in unconstrained Euclidean spaces, which may limit
their ability to reflect complex relationships in language. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework that constrains sentence embeddings to lie on
continuous manifolds -- specifically the unit sphere, torus, and M\"obius strip
-- using triplet loss as the core training objective. By enforcing differential
geometric constraints on the output space, our approach encourages the learning
of embeddings that are both discriminative and topologically structured.
  We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets (AG News and MBTI) and compare
it to classical baselines including TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and unconstrained
Keras-derived embeddings. Our results demonstrate that manifold-constrained
embeddings, particularly those projected onto spheres and M\"obius strips,
significantly outperform traditional approaches in both clustering quality
(Silhouette Score) and classification performance (Accuracy). These findings
highlight the value of embedding in manifold space -- where topological
structure complements semantic separation -- offering a new and mathematically
grounded direction for geometric representation learning in NLP.

### [12] [Design and Application of Multimodal Large Language Model Based System for End to End Automation of Accident Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00015)
*MD Thamed Bin Zaman Chowdhury,Moazzem Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）和网络爬虫技术的自动化交通事故数据收集系统，解决了孟加拉国现有手动、分散且不可靠的数据收集问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家如孟加拉国的交通事故数据收集存在手动、分散和不可靠的问题，导致数据缺失和不一致。

Method: 系统包含四个模块：自动化爬虫代码生成、新闻收集、新闻分类与结构化数据提取、去重。使用多模态生成型LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash实现自动化。

Result: 系统在111天内从14个新闻网站收集了15,000篇新闻，识别出705起独立事故。代码生成模块校准准确率91.3%，验证准确率80%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于LLM的自动化系统可高效、精确地收集交通事故数据，为数据驱动的道路交通安全政策制定提供基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue
in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is
largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and
inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using
Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these
challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping
code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news
classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The
system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless
automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination,
dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts
for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as
date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and
pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by
removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites
over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news
articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module
achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the
highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed
by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning
(8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also
developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an
LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection,
providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

### [13] [Sparks of Tabular Reasoning via Text2SQL Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00016)
*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个两阶段的框架，通过SQL监督培养大型语言模型（LLM）对表格数据的推理能力，提升其在Text-to-SQL任务上的泛化性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Text-to-SQL任务专注于查询生成，而本文希望通过SQL监督让LLM学会推理和操作表格数据，从而超越简单的语法学习。

Method: 1. 合成详细的链式思维（CoT）跟踪，从真实SQL查询中提供逐步、子句级的监督；2. 提出Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）强化学习目标，将SQL执行准确性与通用推理能力关联。

Result: 在标准Text-to-SQL基准测试中表现提升，特别是在BIRD和CRT-QA等推理密集型数据集上效果显著，LLaMA和Qwen模型的准确率分别提升20%和5%。

Conclusion: SQL不仅可以作为目标形式化工具，还能作为学习结构化数据推理的有效支架，提升模型的泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: This work reframes the Text-to-SQL task as a pathway for teaching large
language models (LLMs) to reason over and manipulate tabular data--moving
beyond the traditional focus on query generation. We propose a two-stage
framework that leverages SQL supervision to develop transferable table
reasoning capabilities. First, we synthesize detailed chain-of-thought (CoT)
traces from real-world SQL queries, providing step-by-step, clause-level
supervision that teaches the model how to traverse, filter, and aggregate table
fields. Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to
generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific
syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves
performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains
on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced
generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized
LLaMA model achieved a 20\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL
tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\% increase. These results suggest that SQL can
serve not only as a target formalism but also as an effective scaffold for
learning robust, transferable reasoning over structured data.

to retrieve entities linked to differential genes for cell reconstruction. We
further designed a multi task workflow to optimize the annotation process.

by up to 0.21 and semantic similarity by 6.1% across 11 tissue types, while
more closely aligning with the cognitive logic of manual annotation.

Conclusion: 提示压缩是可行的优化方向，尤其在长上下文场景中表现更突出。

Abstract: Prompt engineering enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform a variety
of tasks. However, lengthy prompts significantly increase computational
complexity and economic costs. To address this issue, we study six prompt
compression methods for LLMs, aiming to reduce prompt length while maintaining
LLM response quality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis
covering aspects such as generation performance, model hallucinations, efficacy
in multimodal tasks, word omission analysis, and more. We evaluate these
methods across 13 datasets, including news, scientific articles, commonsense
QA, math QA, long-context QA, and VQA datasets. Our experiments reveal that
prompt compression has a greater impact on LLM performance in long contexts
compared to short ones. In the Longbench evaluation, moderate compression even
enhances LLM performance. Our code and data is available at

*Sruly Rosenblat,Tim O'Reilly,Ilan Strauss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，使用合法获取的34本O'Reilly Media受版权保护的书籍数据集，探究OpenAI的大型语言模型是否未经许可使用了受版权保护的内容。结果显示，GPT-4o对收费内容识别能力较强（AUROC=82%），而GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容识别较好，GPT-4o Mini则无显著识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证OpenAI的大型语言模型是否在未经授权的情况下使用了受版权保护的O'Reilly Media书籍内容，以推动企业在预训练数据来源上的透明度和正式授权框架的建立。

Method: 采用DE-COP成员推理攻击方法，利用34本O'Reilly Media的版权书籍数据集，测试不同OpenAI模型（GPT-4o、GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4o Mini）对公开和非公开内容的识别能力，并控制时间截点以减少语言变化对结果的潜在影响。

Result: GPT-4o对收费内容表现出较强的识别能力（AUROC=82%），GPT-3.5 Turbo对公开内容识别较好，而GPT-4o Mini对两类内容均无显著识别能力（AUROC≈50%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，AI公司在预训练数据来源上需要更高的透明度，并应建立正式的授权框架，以避免未经许可使用受版权保护的内容。

Abstract: Using a legally obtained dataset of 34 copyrighted O'Reilly Media books, we
apply the DE-COP membership inference attack method to investigate whether
OpenAI's large language models were trained on copyrighted content without
consent. Our AUROC scores show that GPT-4o, OpenAI's more recent and capable
model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O'Reilly book content
(AUROC = 82\%), compared to OpenAI's earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo. In contrast,
GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible
O'Reilly book samples. GPT-4o Mini, as a much smaller model, shows no knowledge
of public or non-public O'Reilly Media content when tested (AUROC $\approx$
50\%). Testing multiple models, with the same cutoff date, helps us account for
potential language shifts over time that might bias our findings. These results
highlight the urgent need for increased corporate transparency regarding
pre-training data sources as a means to develop formal licensing frameworks for
AI content training

TL;DR: 本文介绍了解决食品危害检测中类别不平衡问题的系统，通过数据增强和多种平衡策略（如随机过采样、EDA和焦点损失）提升BERT和RoBERTa模型的性能，实验证明这些方法显著提高了分类准确率和F1值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于食品危害检测任务存在类别不平衡、文本短且非结构化、语义类别重叠等问题，研究旨在通过数据增强和平衡策略提升分类性能。

Method: 采用BERT和RoBERTa作为基础分类器，结合随机过采样、Easy Data Augmentation（EDA）和焦点损失等策略进行改进。

Result: 实验表明，EDA有效缓解了类别不平衡问题，显著提高了准确率和F1值；结合焦点损失和过采样进一步增强了模型鲁棒性，尤其对难分类样本效果显著。

Conclusion: 这些方法为开发更有效的NLP分类模型提供了实践依据，尤其在食品危害检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Classification tasks often suffer from imbal- anced data distribution, which
presents chal- lenges in food hazard detection due to severe class imbalances,
short and unstructured text, and overlapping semantic categories. In this
paper, we present our system for SemEval- 2025 Task 9: Food Hazard Detection,
which ad- dresses these issues by applying data augmenta- tion techniques to
improve classification perfor- mance. We utilize transformer-based models, BERT
and RoBERTa, as backbone classifiers and explore various data balancing
strategies, including random oversampling, Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and
focal loss. Our ex- periments show that EDA effectively mitigates class
imbalance, leading to significant improve- ments in accuracy and F1 scores.
Furthermore, combining focal loss with oversampling and EDA further enhances
model robustness, par- ticularly for hard-to-classify examples. These findings
contribute to the development of more effective NLP-based classification models
for food hazard detection.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种结合启发式和模型过滤技术与合成数据生成的德语数据集构建流程，并证明了其对提升大规模语言模型性能的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提升大规模语言模型（LLM）的训练效率和性能，研究数据质量的关键作用，并探索如何通过数据优化策略（如合成数据生成）弥补数据规模的不足。

Method: 采用启发式与模型过滤技术结合的方法，从Common Crawl、FineWeb2等来源筛选高质量德语数据，并辅以合成数据生成，构建大规模预训练数据集Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb。

Result: 实验证明，使用该数据集预训练的模型（包括1B Llama风格模型和8B HAT模型）在德语基准测试（如MMMLU）中表现显著优于仅使用FineWeb2或其他高质量人工筛选数据集的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于模型的数据筛选和合成数据生成能显著提升LLM预训练数据集的质量，为未来数据优化策略提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Scaling data quantity is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet
recent findings show that data quality can significantly boost performance and
training efficiency. We introduce a German-language dataset curation pipeline
that combines heuristic and model-based filtering techniques with synthetic
data generation. We use our pipeline to create Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb, a
large-scale German pre-training dataset which draws from: (1) Common Crawl web
data, (2) FineWeb2, and (3) synthetically-generated data conditioned on actual,
organic web data. We evaluate our dataset by pre-training both a 1B Llama-style
model and an 8B tokenizer-free hierarchical autoregressive transformer (HAT). A
comparison on German-language benchmarks, including MMMLU, shows significant
performance gains of Aleph-Alpha-GermanWeb over FineWeb2 alone. This advantage
holds at the 8B scale even when FineWeb2 is enriched by human-curated
high-quality data sources such as Wikipedia. Our findings support the growing
body of evidence that model-based data curation and synthetic data generation
can significantly enhance LLM pre-training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实语料库中知识常重复且不一致，现有语言模型难以处理多重上下文关系，需新方法解决。

Method: 提出CORG框架，包括图构造器、重排序器和聚合器，将上下文分组独立处理以实现高效消歧。

Result: CORG在性能与效率间取得平衡，优于现有分组方法，接近计算密集型单上下文方法的水平。

Conclusion: CORG通过结构化处理多重上下文关系，为知识一致性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In a real-world corpus, knowledge frequently recurs across documents but
often contains inconsistencies due to ambiguous naming, outdated information,
or errors, leading to complex interrelationships between contexts. Previous
research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities,
typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these
relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and
duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses
all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context
Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into
independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently
find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three
key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results
demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively,
outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to
more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的方法，通过轻量级的二元奖励监督优化大型语言模型的外部工具调用能力，无需标注推理轨迹，取得了SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的工作通过监督微调或模仿强模型的推理轨迹来增强工具调用能力，但效果有限，无法实现泛化。因此，论文受DeepSeek-R1启发，提出新方法。

Method: 使用二元奖励监督，仅评估工具调用的结构有效性和功能正确性，优化模型内部推理策略，无需标注推理轨迹。

Result: Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1系列模型在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中超越了GPT-4o，取得最佳效果。

Conclusion: 轻量级监督方法成功提升了大型语言模型的工具调用能力，并在实际评测中表现优异。

Abstract: Enabling large language models with external tools has become a pivotal
strategy for extending their functionality beyond text generation tasks. Prior
work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning
traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short,
either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits
generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning
through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar
training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning
traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized
with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional
correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model
to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for
annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank
benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and
Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve
state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.

Result: 实验证明方法在医疗问答数据集上保持专业精度，内存消耗降低64.7%，推理延迟减少12.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境（如边缘计算设备）中的医疗大模型应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, despite foundation models like DeepSeek-R1 and ChatGPT
demonstrating significant capabilities in general tasks, professional knowledge
barriers, computational resource requirements, and deployment environment
limitations have severely hindered their application in actual medical
scenarios. Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient
lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method,
systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from
three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational
optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline
is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology
is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression
level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are
implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical
reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization
techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are
integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt
to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical
question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper
maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\% and
inference latency by 12.4\%, providing an effective solution for the
application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such
as edge computing devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高文本操作的效率并支持自然语言查询，需要从文本中自动提取关键信息维度。

Method: 通过构建高质量的抽象树来表示主题、动作、对象和修饰语及其子类关系，确保树的独立性和表达能力。

Result: 实验显示，基于子类关系构建的抽象树在精度、召回率和F1值上均超过80%，且在自然语言查询中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多树搜索机制能快速缩小搜索范围，支持对文本的精准操作。

Abstract: This paper proposed an approach to automatically discovering subject
dimension, action dimension, object dimension and adverbial dimension from
texts to efficiently operate texts and support query in natural language. The
high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and
adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The
independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between
trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can
be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at
least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in
natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and
F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of
subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application
of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates
that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have
high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object
and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space
to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.

Conclusion: 为端到端语音对话系统的知识整合提供了有前景的方向，将公开代码和数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) dialogue systems have
garnered increasing research attention due to their advantages over traditional
cascaded systems, including achieving lower latency and more natural
integration of nonverbal cues such as emotion and speaker identity. However,
these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating
external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core
difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual
knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we
propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant
textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate
speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of
end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency.
Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our
framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in
end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support
reproducibility and promote further research in this area.

Motivation: 解决大规模视觉语言模型在适应特定领域知识时容易导致基础视觉-语言能力遗忘的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段对话结构：基础保留通过标题任务强化预训练对齐；对比消歧引入反事实示例维护语义边界；知识专门化通过思维链推理嵌入特定信息。

Result: 实验证明SDFT在多项领域能有效平衡特定知识学习和通用能力保留。

Conclusion: SDFT通过结构化对话模板和加权多轮监督框架，实现了知识注入与基础能力保持的平衡。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models have demonstrated impressive versatile
capabilities through extensive multimodal pre-training, but face significant
limitations when incorporating specialized knowledge domains beyond their
training distribution. These models struggle with a fundamental dilemma: direct
adaptation approaches that inject domain-specific knowledge often trigger
catastrophic forgetting of foundational visual-linguistic abilities. We
introduce Structured Dialogue Fine-Tuning (SDFT), an effective approach that
effectively injects domain-specific knowledge while minimizing catastrophic
forgetting. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning in LLMs and
subject-driven personalization in text-to-image diffusion models, our method
employs a three-phase dialogue structure: Foundation Preservation reinforces
pre-trained visual-linguistic alignment through caption tasks; Contrastive
Disambiguation introduces carefully designed counterfactual examples to
maintain semantic boundaries; and Knowledge Specialization embeds specialized
information through chain-of-thought reasoning. Experimental results across
multiple domains confirm SDFT's effectiveness in balancing specialized
knowledge acquisition with general capability retention. Our key contributions
include a data-centric dialogue template that balances foundational alignment
with targeted knowledge integration, a weighted multi-turn supervision
framework, and comprehensive evaluation across diverse knowledge types.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估语言模型模拟历史文本的可靠性，避免时代错误对社会科学研究的影响。

Method: 测试提示（直接输入历史文本示例）和微调模型的效果，通过自动化工具和人类评估对比生成的文本与真实历史文本。

Result: 提示方法无法复现历史风格；微调结果能欺骗自动评估，但人类仍能区分。

Conclusion: 需在历史文本上预训练模型，才能可靠模拟历史视角。

Abstract: Before researchers can use language models to simulate the past, they need to
understand the risk of anachronism. We find that prompting a contemporary model
with examples of period prose does not produce output consistent with period
style. Fine-tuning produces results that are stylistically convincing enough to
fool an automated judge, but human evaluators can still distinguish fine-tuned
model outputs from authentic historical text. We tentatively conclude that
pretraining on period prose may be required in order to reliably simulate
historical perspectives for social research.

Result: LEPA在多项自然语言推理基准测试中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 通过提取和利用预计划，LEPA有效提升了大语言模型的推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) post-training, the effectiveness
of utilizing synthetic data generated by the LLM itself has been
well-presented. However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential
information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches
only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract
meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing
insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to
simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel
self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains
the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge
for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This
approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the
LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA
first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a
solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan
through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in
yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to
predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently
extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable
superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural
language reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) impacts more than 300 million people
worldwide, highlighting a significant public health issue. However, the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the complexity of diagnostic methods have
resulted in inadequate attention to this disorder in numerous countries and
regions. This paper introduces a high-performance MDD diagnosis tool named
MDD-LLM, an AI-driven framework that utilizes fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) and extensive real-world samples to tackle challenges in MDD diagnosis.
Therefore, we select 274,348 individual information from the UK Biobank cohort
to train and evaluate the proposed method. Specifically, we select 274,348
individual records from the UK Biobank cohort and design a tabular data
transformation method to create a large corpus for training and evaluating the
proposed approach. To illustrate the advantages of MDD-LLM, we perform
comprehensive experiments and provide several comparative analyses against
existing model-based solutions across multiple evaluation metrics. Experimental
results show that MDD-LLM (70B) achieves an accuracy of 0.8378 and an AUC of
0.8919 (95% CI: 0.8799 - 0.9040), significantly outperforming existing machine
learning and deep learning frameworks for MDD diagnosis. Given the limited
exploration of LLMs in MDD diagnosis, we examine numerous factors that may
influence the performance of our proposed method, such as tabular data
transformation techniques and different fine-tuning strategies.

Motivation: 传统Transformer的自注意力机制因二次计算复杂度导致效率和可扩展性问题，需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 结合时间域（嵌入重构）和频域（短时傅里叶变换幅度匹配）的重构损失与语言建模目标，并采用高斯混合模型（GMM）作为混合向量的先验分布。

Result: 在WikiText2和Penn Treebank上达到与Transformer基线相当的性能，同时显著降低推理延迟和内存占用。

Conclusion: 谱字典模型为可扩展语言建模提供了高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel spectral generative modeling framework for natural
language processing that jointly learns a global time varying Fourier
dictionary and per token mixing coefficients, replacing the ubiquitous self
attention mechanism in transformer architectures. By enforcing reconstruction
losses in both the time domain (embedding reconstruction) and the frequency
domain (via Short Time Fourier Transform magnitude matching) alongside a
standard language modeling objective, and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior over the learned mixing vectors, our approach achieves competitive
perplexity and generation quality on standard benchmarks such as WikiText2 and
Penn Treebank. In contrast to the quadratic computation complexity of self
attention, our method operates with linear complexity, delivering substantial
efficiency gains. We demonstrate that spectral dictionary models can achieve
competitive performance compared to transformer baselines while significantly
reducing inference latency and memory footprint, offering a compelling
alternative for scalable language modeling.

Abstract: Large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
natural language processing(NLP) tasks and have been employed in phishing email
detection research. However, in current studies, well-performing LLMs typically
contain billions or even tens of billions of parameters, requiring enormous
computational resources. To reduce computational costs, we investigated the
effectiveness of small-parameter LLMs for phishing email detection. These LLMs
have around 3 billion parameters and can run on consumer-grade GPUs. However,
small LLMs often perform poorly in phishing email detection task. To address
these issues, we designed a set of methods including Prompt Engineering,
Explanation Augmented Fine-tuning, and Model Ensemble to improve phishing email
detection capabilities of small LLMs. We validated the effectiveness of our
approach through experiments, significantly improving accuracy on the
SpamAssassin dataset from around 0.5 for baseline models like
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct to 0.976.

### [31] [Linguistic Complexity and Socio-cultural Patterns in Hip-Hop Lyrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00035)
*Aayam Bansal,Raghav Agarwal,Kaashvi Jain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个分析说唱歌词语言复杂性及社会文化趋势的计算框架，通过自然语言处理技术量化多维度复杂性，发现词汇多样性、押韵密度等指标的变化，并揭示了歌词主题与情感随社会政治事件的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在通过量化分析说唱歌词的语言复杂性及主题变化，探讨其作为艺术形式与社会动态反映的演变过程，揭示语言创新与文化背景的相互作用。

Method: 使用3,814首歌曲的数据集，应用自然语言处理技术，包括词汇多样性分析、押韵密度计算、主题建模和情感分析，并结合统计方法进行多维度分析。

Result: 发现词汇多样性增加了23.7%，押韵密度上升了34.2%，主题内容显著变化（社会正义主题减少，内省主题增加），情感在政治危机期间更消极。同时，地域和时间与风格高度相关。

Conclusion: 研究为说唱音乐作为艺术形式和社会反映的演变提供了量化证据，展示了语言创新与文化背景的紧密联系。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive computational framework for analyzing
linguistic complexity and socio-cultural trends in hip-hop lyrics. Using a
dataset of 3,814 songs from 146 influential artists spanning four decades
(1980-2020), we employ natural language processing techniques to quantify
multiple dimensions of lyrical complexity. Our analysis reveals a 23.7%
increase in vocabulary diversity over the study period, with East Coast artists
demonstrating 17.3% higher lexical variation than other regions. Rhyme density
increased by 34.2% across all regions, with Midwest artists exhibiting the
highest technical complexity (3.04 rhymes per line). Topic modeling identified
significant shifts in thematic content, with social justice themes decreasing
from 28.5% to 13.8% of content while introspective themes increased from 7.6%
to 26.3%. Sentiment analysis demon- strated that lyrics became significantly
more negative during sociopolitical crises, with polarity decreasing by 0.31
following major social unrest. Multi-dimensional analysis revealed four dis-
tinct stylistic approaches that correlate strongly with geographic origin
(r=0.68, p!0.001) and time period (r=0.59, p<0.001). These findings establish
quantitative evidence for the evolution of hip- hop as both an art form and a
reflection of societal dynamics, providing insights into the interplay between
linguistic innovation and cultural context in popular music.

*Zhongren Chen,Joshua Kalla,Quan Le,Shinpei Nakamura-Sakai,Jasjeet Sekhon,Ruixiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，LLMs在说服选民方面与传统政治广告效果相当，但成本更低（每人48-74美元 vs 100美元）。然而，目前传统方法更易扩展。LLMs的大规模政治说服潜力可能随技术提升而增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否比传统政治竞选方法更具成本效益的说服力，及其对民主社会的潜在威胁。

Method: 通过两项调查实验（N=10,417）和真实世界模拟，评估LLMs与传统方法的成本效益和说服效果。

Result: LLMs与传统广告说服效果相近但成本更低，但传统方法更易扩展。当前LLMs的大规模说服潜力有限。

Conclusion: LLMs目前尚未显著超越传统方法，但随着技术发展，其大规模政治说服潜力可能增强。

Abstract: In recent years, significant concern has emerged regarding the potential
threat that Large Language Models (LLMs) pose to democratic societies through
their persuasive capabilities. We expand upon existing research by conducting
two survey experiments and a real-world simulation exercise to determine
whether it is more cost effective to persuade a large number of voters using
LLM chatbots compared to standard political campaign practice, taking into
account both the "receive" and "accept" steps in the persuasion process (Zaller
1992). These experiments improve upon previous work by assessing extended
interactions between humans and LLMs (instead of using single-shot
interactions) and by assessing both short- and long-run persuasive effects
(rather than simply asking users to rate the persuasiveness of LLM-produced
content). In two survey experiments (N = 10,417) across three distinct
political domains, we find that while LLMs are about as persuasive as actual
campaign ads once voters are exposed to them, political persuasion in the
real-world depends on both exposure to a persuasive message and its impact
conditional on exposure. Through simulations based on real-world parameters, we
estimate that LLM-based persuasion costs between \$48-\$74 per persuaded voter
compared to \$100 for traditional campaign methods, when accounting for the
costs of exposure. However, it is currently much easier to scale traditional
campaign persuasion methods than LLM-based persuasion. While LLMs do not
currently appear to have substantially greater potential for large-scale
political persuasion than existing non-LLM methods, this may change as LLM
capabilities continue to improve and it becomes easier to scalably encourage
exposure to persuasive LLMs.

### [33] [HyPerAlign: Hypotheses-driven Personalized Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00038)
*Cristina Garbacea,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HyPerAlign的新型个性化方法，通过推断用户的沟通策略、个性和写作风格，生成定制化的LLM输出，优于传统的基于偏好的微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型（LLM）通常基于“平均用户”偏好进行对齐，忽略了用户个人化的需求。本文旨在解决这一问题，为个体用户生成定制化的输出。

Method: 提出HyPerAlign方法：首先根据少量用户示例推断其沟通策略、个性和写作风格，再将这些假设与用户特定属性结合，生成定制化输出。

Result: 在作者归属和审议对齐任务中，HyPerAlign显著优于传统偏好微调方法。审议对齐的LLM帮助性平均提升70%，作者归属任务中胜率通常超过90%。

Conclusion: HyPerAlign提供了一种可解释且样本高效的LLM个性化策略，为个体用户生成定制化输出。

Abstract: Alignment algorithms are widely used to align large language models (LLMs) to
human users based on preference annotations that reflect their intended
real-world use cases. Typically these (often divergent) preferences are
aggregated over a diverse set of users, resulting in fine-tuned models that are
aligned to the ``average-user'' preference. Nevertheless, current models are
used by individual users in very specific contexts and situations, emphasizing
the need for user-dependent preference control. In this work we address the
problem of personalizing LLM outputs to their users, aiming to generate
customized responses tailored to individual users, instead of generic outputs
that emulate the collective voices of diverse populations. We propose a novel
interpretable and sample-efficient hypotheses-driven personalization approach
(HyPerAlign) where given few-shot examples written by a particular user, we
first infer hypotheses about their communication strategies, personality and
writing style, then prompt LLM models with these hypotheses and user specific
attributes to generate customized outputs. We conduct experiments on two
different personalization tasks, authorship attribution and deliberative
alignment, with datasets from diverse domains (news articles, blog posts,
emails, jailbreaking benchmarks), and demonstrate the superiority of
hypotheses-driven personalization approach when compared to preference-based
fine-tuning methods. For deliberative alignment, the helpfulness of LLM models
is improved by up to $70\%$ on average. For authorship attribution, results
indicate consistently high win-rates (commonly $>90\%$) against
state-of-the-art preference fine-tuning approaches for LLM personalization
across diverse user profiles and LLM models. Overall, our approach represents
an interpretable and sample-efficient strategy for the personalization of LLM
models to individual users.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专门用于法律规范分析的Graph RAG改进方法，利用知识图谱和上下文丰富的文本段处理法律数据的复杂性和规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律规范具有预定义的层次结构、大量内外引用和多时间版本，传统方法难以处理其复杂性和规模，因此需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 结合结构化知识图谱和上下文丰富的文本段，通过层次结构和时间演化的知识图谱构建更丰富的法律知识表示。

Result: Graph RAG在法律规范数据集上的应用证明其能有效处理法律数据的复杂性，为法律研究、立法分析和决策支持提供更高效的系统。

Conclusion: Graph RAG为人工智能在法律领域的应用提供了重要进展，有望推动更高效的法律分析和决策支持系统的发展。

Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal
norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure,
extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal
versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched
text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent
complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical
structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept
of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer,
interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis
of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to
significantly advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law,
creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research,
legislative analysis, and decision support.

### [35] [Base Models Beat Aligned Models at Randomness and Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00047)
*Peter West,Christopher Potts*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，虽然对齐技术（如RLHF）能让LLM更安全、遵循指令和改善性能，但在需要不可预测输出的任务（如随机数生成、混合策略游戏和创意写作）中，基础语言模型表现优于对齐模型。对齐模型倾向于产生狭窄行为，导致在特定任务中表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于验证对齐技术是否适用于所有任务，并发现其在需要不可预测性或创造力的任务中可能表现不佳。

Method: 通过对比基础语言模型和对齐模型在随机数生成、混合策略游戏和创意写作等任务中的表现进行分析。

Result: 结果表明，对齐模型在这些任务中倾向于产生可预测或狭窄的行为，导致性能低于基础模型，且常见基准测试的改进与这些任务的表现呈负相关。

Conclusion: 结论是对齐技术并非适用于所有场景，需根据任务特性权衡对齐程度，以避免牺牲模型在不可预测或创造性任务中的能力。

Abstract: Alignment has quickly become a default ingredient in LLM development, with
techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback making models act
safely, follow instructions, and perform ever-better on complex tasks. While
these techniques are certainly useful, we propose that they should not be
universally applied and demonstrate a range of tasks on which base language
models consistently outperform their popular aligned forms. Particularly, we
study tasks that require unpredictable outputs, such as random number
generation, mixed strategy games (rock-paper-scissors and hide-and-seek), and
creative writing. In each case, aligned models tend towards narrow behaviors
that result in distinct disadvantages, for instance, preferring to generate "7"
over other uniformly random numbers, becoming almost fully predictable in some
game states, or prioritizing pleasant writing over creative originality. Across
models tested, better performance on common benchmarks tends to correlate with
worse performance on our tasks, suggesting an effective trade-off in the
required capabilities.

Motivation: 探索社交媒体情绪如何作为时尚趋势的早期预测指标，填补时尚行业数据分析的空白。

Method: 采用自然语言处理、机器学习、时间序列分解、格兰杰因果分析及跨平台情绪对比，对时尚相关内容进行分类和情绪标注。

Result: 配饰和街头服饰情绪与趋势显著相关，可持续性和街头服饰是主要驱动因素，预测模型平衡准确率达78.35%。

Conclusion: 社交媒体情绪分析结合统计验证能有效预测时尚趋势，为行业提供数据支持。

Abstract: This study explores the intersection of fashion trends and social media
sentiment through computational analysis of Twitter data using the T4SA
(Twitter for Sentiment Analysis) dataset. By applying natural language
processing and machine learning techniques, we examine how sentiment patterns
in fashion-related social media conversations can serve as predictors for
emerging fashion trends. Our analysis involves the identification and
categorization of fashion-related content, sentiment classification with
improved normalization techniques, time series decomposition, statistically
validated causal relationship modeling, cross-platform sentiment comparison,
and brand-specific sentiment analysis. Results indicate correlations between
sentiment patterns and fashion theme popularity, with accessories and
streetwear themes showing statistically significant rising trends. The Granger
causality analysis establishes sustainability and streetwear as primary trend
drivers, showing bidirectional relationships with several other themes. The
findings demonstrate that social media sentiment analysis can serve as an
effective early indicator of fashion trend trajectories when proper statistical
validation is applied. Our improved predictive model achieved 78.35% balanced
accuracy in sentiment classification, establishing a reliable foundation for
trend prediction across positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络梗聚类对毒性检测、传播建模等很重要，但之前研究较少，且现有方法忽视了语义和多模态特性。

Method: 利用模板匹配结合多维相似特征（形式、视觉内容、文本、身份等），通过局部和全局特征聚类。

Result: 该方法生成的聚类更一致、连贯，且相似性特征集支持自适应匹配，符合人类直觉。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 新方法在多维相似性框架下显著提升了梗聚类效果，支持后续研究。

Abstract: Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and
typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering
similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural
context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook
semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper
introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with
multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined
databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and
global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content,
text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering
methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while
similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human
intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent
research. Code: https://github.com/tygobl/meme-clustering

TL;DR: 该论文提出了BERSt数据集，用于评估远距离语音识别、喊叫检测和情感识别任务，并展示了ASR和SER的初始基准结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音识别在某些任务上接近人类水平，但在复杂现实场景（如远距离语音）中表现仍不足。现有数据集多关注多麦克风阵列系统，缺乏多样性。

Method: 通过智能手机在98种不同声学环境中收集近4小时的英语语音数据，涵盖不同口音、情感和喊叫/普通发音，手机放置位置多样。

Result: ASR性能随距离和喊叫水平增加而下降，情感识别表现也因情感类型而异。BERSt数据集对ASR和SER任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: BERSt数据集为语音识别系统在现实场景中的鲁棒性改进提供了重要资源，但相关技术仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Some speech recognition tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR),
are approaching or have reached human performance in many reported metrics.
Yet, they continue to struggle in complex, real-world, situations, such as with
distanced speech. Previous challenges have released datasets to address the
issue of distanced ASR, however, the focus remains primarily on distance,
specifically relying on multi-microphone array systems. Here we present the
B(asic) E(motion) R(andom phrase) S(hou)t(s) (BERSt) dataset. The dataset
contains almost 4 hours of English speech from 98 actors with varying regional
and non-native accents. The data was collected on smartphones in the actors
homes and therefore includes at least 98 different acoustic environments. The
data also includes 7 different emotion prompts and both shouted and spoken
utterances. The smartphones were places in 19 different positions, including
obstructions and being in a different room than the actor. This data is
publicly available for use and can be used to evaluate a variety of speech
recognition tasks, including: ASR, shout detection, and speech emotion
recognition (SER). We provide initial benchmarks for ASR and SER tasks, and
find that ASR degrades both with an increase in distance and shout level and
shows varied performance depending on the intended emotion. Our results show
that the BERSt dataset is challenging for both ASR and SER tasks and continued
work is needed to improve the robustness of such systems for more accurate
real-world use.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个事实一致性评估框架来评估大语言模型（LLM）生成的SQL查询的语义准确性，使用Exaone 3.5模型进行实验，结果显示其在简单任务中表现良好，但在复杂任务（如算术推理和分组排名）中表现显著下降，突显了LLM在商业关键环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）在自然语言到SQL生成方面显示出潜力，但其在商业智能（BI）实际应用中的表现受限，主要由于语义幻觉、结构错误和缺乏领域特定的评估框架。本研究旨在通过一个事实一致性评估框架，解决这些问题并推动可靠的LLM应用。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含219个自然语言商业问题的领域特定基准，涵盖了五个SQL复杂度级别。这些问题来自LG Electronics的实际销售数据。每个问题配有标准SQL查询和验证过的真实答案。使用Exaone 3.5模型进行评估，测试指标包括答案准确性、执行成功率、语义错误率和无响应率。

Result: Exaone 3.5在简单聚合任务中表现良好（L1级别93%准确率），但在算术推理（H1级别4%准确率）和分组排名任务（H4级别31%准确率）中表现显著下降。语义错误和无响应主要集中在复杂任务中。定性分析揭示了常见错误类型，如算术逻辑误用、过滤不完整和分组操作错误。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLM在商业关键环境中的当前局限性，并提出了需要事实一致性验证层和混合推理方法的重要性。该工作为结构化企业数据系统的可靠自然语言接口提供了一个可复现的基准和评估方法，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in enabling natural language
interfaces for structured data querying through text-to-SQL generation.
However, their application in real-world Business Intelligence (BI) contexts
remains limited due to semantic hallucinations, structural errors, and a lack
of domain-specific evaluation frameworks. In this study, we propose a
Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of
LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM
optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark
comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity
levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery
environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a
validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer
accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate.
Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple
aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in
arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4),
with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases.
Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as
misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping
operations. Our findings highlight the current limitations of LLMs in
business-critical environments and underscore the need for fact-consistency
validation layers and hybrid reasoning approaches. This work contributes a
reproducible benchmark and evaluation methodology for advancing reliable
natural language interfaces to structured enterprise data systems.

Abstract: This study examines vulnerabilities in transformer-based automated
short-answer grading systems used in medical education, with a focus on how
these systems can be manipulated through adversarial gaming strategies. Our
research identifies three main types of gaming strategies that exploit the
system's weaknesses, potentially leading to false positives. To counteract
these vulnerabilities, we implement several adversarial training methods
designed to enhance the systems' robustness. Our results indicate that these
methods significantly reduce the susceptibility of grading systems to such
manipulations, especially when combined with ensemble techniques like majority
voting and ridge regression, which further improve the system's defense against
sophisticated adversarial inputs. Additionally, employing large language models
such as GPT-4 with varied prompting techniques has shown promise in recognizing
and scoring gaming strategies effectively. The findings underscore the
importance of continuous improvements in AI-driven educational tools to ensure
their reliability and fairness in high-stakes settings.

Motivation: 现有基准无法系统性地定位多模态大语言模型在文档领域的弱点或指导改进，因此需要GDI-Bench填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了分等级的任务结构（解耦视觉与推理复杂度），并提出了GDI模型（通过智能保留训练策略避免SFT过程中的灾难性遗忘）。

Conclusion: GDI-Bench和GDI模型为文档领域多模态模型评估与优化提供系统性解决方案，未来将开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
profoundly impacted the document domain, creating a wide array of application
scenarios. This progress highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate these models' capabilities across various document-specific tasks.
However, existing benchmarks often fail to locate specific model weaknesses or
guide systematic improvements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a General
Document Intelligence Benchmark (GDI-Bench), featuring 1.9k images across 9 key
scenarios and 19 document-specific tasks. By decoupling visual complexity and
reasoning complexity, the GDI-Bench structures graded tasks that allow
performance assessment by difficulty, aiding in model weakness identification
and optimization guidance. We evaluate the GDI-Bench on various open-source and
closed-source models, conducting decoupled analyses in the visual and reasoning
domains. For instance, the GPT-4o model excels in reasoning tasks but exhibits
limitations in visual capabilities. To address the diverse tasks and domains in
the GDI-Bench, we propose a GDI Model that mitigates the issue of catastrophic
forgetting during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process through a
intelligence-preserving training strategy. Our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance on previous benchmarks and the GDI-Bench. Both our benchmark and
model will be open source.

Result: 实验证明新指标能有效识别答案是否基于上下文，具有计算高效、可解释和适应性强的优点。

Conclusion: 该指标为开放书问答系统的上下文利用评估提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable success in
open-book question answering (QA), where the task requires generating answers
grounded in a provided external context. A critical challenge in open-book QA
is to ensure that model responses are based on the provided context rather than
its parametric knowledge, which can be outdated, incomplete, or incorrect.
Existing evaluation methods, primarily based on the LLM-as-a-judge approach,
face significant limitations, including biases, scalability issues, and
dependence on costly external systems. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel metric that contrasts the perplexity of the model response under two
conditions: when the context is provided and when it is not. The resulting
score quantifies the extent to which the model's answer relies on the provided
context. The validity of this metric is demonstrated through a series of
experiments that show its effectiveness in identifying whether a given answer
is grounded in the provided context. Unlike existing approaches, this metric is
computationally efficient, interpretable, and adaptable to various use cases,
offering a scalable and practical solution to assess context utilization in
open-book QA systems.

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
translating the low-resource Lebanese dialect, focusing on the impact of
culturally authentic data versus larger translated datasets. We compare three
fine-tuning approaches: Basic, contrastive, and grammar-hint tuning, using
open-source Aya23 models. Experiments reveal that models fine-tuned on a
smaller but culturally aware Lebanese dataset (LW) consistently outperform
those trained on larger, non-native data. The best results were achieved
through contrastive fine-tuning paired with contrastive prompting, which
indicates the benefits of exposing translation models to bad examples. In
addition, to ensure authentic evaluation, we introduce LebEval, a new benchmark
derived from native Lebanese content, and compare it to the existing FLoRes
benchmark. Our findings challenge the "More Data is Better" paradigm and
emphasize the crucial role of cultural authenticity in dialectal translation.
We made our datasets and code available on Github.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在推理长度与答案正确性之间存在矛盾：简单问题过度推理，复杂问题推理不足。通过偏好优化算法减少长度可保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的推理长度与答案正确性的关系，揭示模型在问题难度判断和响应长度校准上的不足。

Method: 系统性实证研究推理长度与答案正确性的关系，并通过偏好优化算法减少生成长度。

Result: LLMs对简单问题过度推理，对复杂问题推理不足；生成长度减少后仍能保持准确性。

Conclusion: 生成长度是推理行为的重要信号，未来需探索LLMs在推理长度自适应中的自我意识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly optimized for long reasoning,
under the assumption that more reasoning leads to better performance. However,
emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy
rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study
of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find
that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long
outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it
is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty
and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization
algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer
correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly
reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight
generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate
further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation.

### [46] [AdaptMI: Adaptive Skill-based In-context Math Instruction for Small Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00147)
*Yinghui He,Abhishek Panigrahi,Yong Lin,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在小型语言模型（SLM）中基于技能的上下文学习（ICL）的性能问题，提出了AdaptMI和AdaptMI+方法，通过自适应选择技能示例来提高SLM在数学问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，基于技能的ICL策略虽然能提升大型语言模型（LLM）的表现，但在SLM中效果有限甚至有害，尤其是在简单问题上引发认知过载。

Method: 论文提出了AdaptMI方法，仅在模型表现不佳时引入技能示例，并进一步提出AdaptMI+，针对模型缺失的具体技能补充示例。

Result: 在五个SLM（1B-7B）和多个数学基准测试中，AdaptMI+在5-shot设置下比简单技能策略准确率提升高达6%。

Conclusion: AdaptMI和AdaptMI+通过自适应技能选择有效提升了SLM的ICL性能，尤其在避免认知过载方面表现突出。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows a language model to improve its
problem-solving capability when provided with suitable information in context.
Since the choice of in-context information can be determined based on the
problem itself, in-context learning is analogous to human learning from
teachers in a classroom. Recent works (Didolkar et al., 2024a; 2024b) show that
ICL performance can be improved by leveraging a frontier large language model's
(LLM) ability to predict required skills to solve a problem, popularly referred
to as an LLM's metacognition, and using the recommended skills to construct
necessary in-context examples. While this skill-based strategy boosts ICL
performance in larger models, its gains on small language models (SLMs) have
been minimal, highlighting a performance gap in ICL capabilities. We
investigate this gap and show that skill-based prompting can hurt SLM
performance on easy questions by introducing unnecessary information, akin to
cognitive overload. To address this, we introduce AdaptMI, an adaptive approach
to selecting skill-based in-context Math Instructions for SLMs. Inspired by
cognitive load theory from human pedagogy, our method only introduces
skill-based examples when the model performs poorly. We further propose
AdaptMI+, which adds examples targeted to the specific skills missing from the
model's responses. On 5-shot evaluations across popular math benchmarks and
five SLMs (1B--7B; Qwen, Llama), AdaptMI+ improves accuracy by up to 6% over
naive skill-based strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于AI的放射学报告分析方法缺乏可解释性，阻碍了其在临床中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用信息追踪框架提取关键查询，Flan-T5模型判断报告中是否包含相关事实，最后用分类器预测疾病。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过设计实现可解释性，有望提升医学AI的信任度和实用性。

Abstract: The development of AI-based methods for analyzing radiology reports could
lead to significant advances in medical diagnosis--from improving diagnostic
accuracy to enhancing efficiency and reducing workload. However, the lack of
interpretability in these methods has hindered their adoption in clinical
settings. In this paper, we propose an interpretable-by-design framework for
classifying radiology reports. The key idea is to extract a set of most
informative queries from a large set of reports and use these queries and their
corresponding answers to predict a diagnosis. Thus, the explanation for a
prediction is, by construction, the set of selected queries and answers. We use
the Information Pursuit framework to select informative queries, the Flan-T5
model to determine if facts are present in the report, and a classifier to
predict the disease. Experiments on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting its potential to enhance
trust and usability in medical AI.

Abstract: Despite growing global interest in Korean language education, there remains a
significant lack of learner corpora tailored to Korean L2 writing. To address
this gap, we enhance the KoLLA Korean learner corpus by adding multiple
grammatical error correction (GEC) references, thereby enabling more nuanced
and flexible evaluation of GEC systems, and reflects the variability of human
language. Additionally, we enrich the corpus with rubric-based scores aligned
with guidelines from the Korean National Language Institute, capturing
grammatical accuracy, coherence, and lexical diversity. These enhancements make
KoLLA a robust and standardized resource for research in Korean L2 education,

Conclusion: 为确保AI语言模型在特定领域任务中的适用性和一致性，需制定标准化评估方法和改进策略。

Abstract: The hallmark of effective language use lies in consistency -- expressing
similar meanings in similar contexts and avoiding contradictions. While human
communication naturally demonstrates this principle, state-of-the-art language
models struggle to maintain reliable consistency across different scenarios.
This paper examines the landscape of consistency research in AI language
systems, exploring both formal consistency (including logical rule adherence)
and informal consistency (such as moral and factual coherence). We analyze
current approaches to measure aspects of consistency, identify critical
research gaps in standardization of definitions, multilingual assessment, and
methods to improve consistency. Our findings point to an urgent need for robust
benchmarks to measure and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure consistency in
the application of language models on domain-specific tasks while preserving
the utility and adaptability.

TL;DR: KoACD是首个面向韩国青少年的大规模认知扭曲数据集，包含108,717条实例，采用多LLM协商方法优化分类，并通过两种方式生成合成数据。尽管LLM在显性标记分类上表现良好，但在上下文推理上不如人类评估者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注小规模成人数据，对青少年认知扭曲的研究有限。此研究旨在填补这一空白，为未来相关研究提供资源。

Method: 引入KoACD数据集，应用多LLM协商方法进行认知扭曲分类，并通过'认知澄清'和'认知平衡'两种方法生成合成数据。

Result: LLM在显性标记分类表现良好，但在上下文推理任务上准确率低于人类评估者。

Conclusion: KoACD数据集为认知扭曲检测研究提供了新资源，同时揭示了LLM在复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Cognitive distortion refers to negative thinking patterns that can lead to
mental health issues like depression and anxiety in adolescents. Previous
studies using natural language processing (NLP) have focused mainly on
small-scale adult datasets, with limited research on adolescents. This study
introduces KoACD, the first large-scale dataset of cognitive distortions in
Korean adolescents, containing 108,717 instances. We applied a multi-Large
Language Model (LLM) negotiation method to refine distortion classification and
generate synthetic data using two approaches: cognitive clarification for
textual clarity and cognitive balancing for diverse distortion representation.
Validation through LLMs and expert evaluations showed that while LLMs
classified distortions with explicit markers, they struggled with
context-dependent reasoning, where human evaluators demonstrated higher
accuracy. KoACD aims to enhance future research on cognitive distortion
detection.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为CSE-SFP的创新方法，旨在为仅解码器预训练语言模型（PLMs）设计高效的无监督文本表示框架，通过单次前向传递实现对比学习，提升嵌入质量并减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型在句子表示领域取得了显著进展，但现有的无监督嵌入方法主要集中在判别式PLMs（如BERT）上。由于生成式PLMs参数规模庞大且在实际应用中占据主导地位，亟需一种针对解码器架构的高效无监督表示方法。

Method: CSE-SFP利用生成式模型的结构特点，仅需单次前向传递即可完成无监督对比学习。该方法还引入了两种比率指标，联合评估编码模型的语义空间对齐性和均匀性。

Result: 实验表明，CSE-SFP生成的嵌入质量更高，同时显著降低了训练时间和内存消耗。新提出的评估指标为编码模型的语义空间特性提供了更鲁棒的分析工具。

Conclusion: CSE-SFP填补了生成式PLMs无监督句子表示的空白，其高效性和性能优势为后续研究及工业应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As a fundamental task in Information Retrieval and Computational Linguistics,
sentence representation has profound implications for a wide range of practical
applications such as text clustering, content analysis, question-answering
systems, and web search. Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through
unsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like
BERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have
attempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative
PLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that
state-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based
on generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient
unsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To
address this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits
the structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing
strategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective
unsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that
CSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly
reduces both training time and memory consumption. Furthermore, we introduce
two ratio metrics that jointly assess alignment and uniformity, thereby
providing a more robust means for evaluating the semantic spatial properties of
encoding models.

Motivation: 由于欧盟法律文件数量庞大（约18万份），需要一种可扩展的计算方法来高效识别监管声明，以衡量法规的密度和严格性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：基于依赖解析的模型和基于Transformer的机器学习模型，并使用机构语法工具提供了具体的定义。

Result: 两种方法的准确性分别为80%和84%，K alpha值为0.58，表明性能接近但一致性不高。

Conclusion: 两种方法表现相似，但未达到高度一致，因此结合两者优势可能提升整体性能。

Abstract: Identifying regulatory statements in legislation is useful for developing
metrics to measure the regulatory density and strictness of legislation. A
computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such
statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately
180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of
these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what
constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific
definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop
and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such
statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on
a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed
similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of
0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential
for combining strengths of both approaches.

grounded in supporting evidence$\unicode{x2013}$has become a critical
challenge. Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection are often
synthetically generated, narrowly focused on extractive question answering, and
fail to capture the complexity of real-world scenarios involving multi-document
contexts and full-sentence outputs. We introduce the HalluMix Benchmark, a
diverse, task-agnostic dataset that includes examples from a range of domains
and formats. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven hallucination detection
systems$\unicode{x2013}$both open and closed
source$\unicode{x2013}$highlighting differences in performance across tasks,
document lengths, and input representations. Our analysis highlights
substantial performance disparities between short and long contexts, with
critical implications for real-world Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Abstract: The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel
evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of
DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in
the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of
language models. However, the implementation details of the released models
have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero,
DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication
studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by
DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training
procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated
feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning
from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design,
yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of
recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on
SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data
construction, method design and training procedure of current replication
studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and
experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future
research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting
the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and
discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help
researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements,
and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.

Conclusion: 该框架为研究语言模型幻觉提供了可复现的测试方法，并为开发更具自省能力的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) present a growing challenge
across real-world applications, from healthcare to law, where factual
reliability is essential. Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning,
LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue.
Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains
an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to
systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing
Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,
periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a
Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,
confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple
LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more
hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied
across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from
general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for
studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer,
more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of
conceptual instability.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为FreqKV的新方法，通过在频域压缩KV缓存来高效扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口，无需额外参数或架构修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口时，KV缓存的内存需求和自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为主要挑战，现有方法在长上下文场景下性能下降严重。

Method: 利用KV缓存在频域中能量集中于低频分量的特性，提出FreqKV方法，通过过滤高频分量实现高效压缩，适用于微调和推理。

Result: 实验表明，FreqKV能在各种长上下文任务中高效扩展窗口，且性能表现优异。

Conclusion: FreqKV是一种高效、无需额外成本的上下文扩展方法，显著提升了长上下文场景下的模型性能。

Abstract: Extending the context window in large language models (LLMs) is essential for
applications involving long-form content generation. However, the linear
increase in key-value (KV) cache memory requirements and the quadratic
complexity of self-attention with respect to sequence length present
significant challenges during fine-tuning and inference. Existing methods
suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this
work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both
fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in
the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily
concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency
components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information
loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique,
FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in
the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV
introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With
minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is
compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently.
Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks
demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is difficult due to their huge model
size. Recent Fourier domain-based methods show potential for reducing
fine-tuning costs. We propose a block circulant matrix-based fine-tuning method
with a stable training heuristic to leverage the properties of circulant
matrices and one-dimensional Fourier transforms to reduce storage and
computation costs. Experiments show that our method uses $14\times$ less number
of parameters than VeRA, $16\times$ smaller than LoRA and $32\times$ less FLOPs
than FourierFT, while maintaining close or better task performance. Our
approach presents a promising way in frequency domain to fine-tune large models
on downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练大型语言模型需要大量计算资源，因此需要开发更小但高效的领域专用模型，避免传统中型模型在领域数据集上的性能下降。

Method: 采用稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取领域特定子集，结合结构化剪枝保留关键知识，并通过自数据蒸馏恢复剪枝损失的信息。

Result: FineScope 在领域任务中表现优异，超越多个 SOTA 大模型，且剪枝模型通过 SAE 数据集微调后能恢复大部分原始性能。

Conclusion: FineScope 展示了领域优化 LLMs 的高效方法，框架的普适性也为未剪枝模型的领域微调提供了优势。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch requires significant
computational resources, driving interest in developing smaller,
domain-specific LLMs that maintain both efficiency and strong task performance.
Medium-sized models such as LLaMA, llama} have served as starting points for
domain-specific adaptation, but they often suffer from accuracy degradation
when tested on specialized datasets. We introduce FineScope, a framework for
deriving compact, domain-optimized LLMs from larger pretrained models.
FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its
ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract
domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with
domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain
essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance,
these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated
datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning.
Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves
highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale
state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show
that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their
original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore,
applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also
improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our
approach. The code will be released.

### [61] [The Illusion of Role Separation: Hidden Shortcuts in LLM Role Learning (and How to Fix Them)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00626)
*Zihao Wang,Yibo Jiang,Jiahao Yu,Heqing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何让大语言模型（LLM）更好地区分不同角色的输入（如系统指令、用户查询），提出了一种通过调整输入编码中的位置ID来强化角色边界的方法，从而减少对表层代理的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多角色输入模型（如系统指令、用户查询）在实际应用中越来越普遍，但模型是否能真正区分不同角色的输入仍存疑。研究旨在探索如何通过机制而非单纯记忆来提升角色分离的可靠性。

Method: 通过一个简单的实验框架发现，微调后的模型依赖任务类型和文本开头位置作为代理。为此，作者提出通过调整输入编码中的标记级提示（如位置ID）来强化角色边界的信号。

Result: 实验表明，调整位置ID能帮助模型更清晰地区分角色，减少对表层代理的依赖，从而提升多角色行为的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过机制驱动的视角，本研究展示了如何让LLM在不依赖单纯记忆的情况下，更可靠地保持多角色行为的一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that integrate multiple input roles (e.g.,
system instructions, user queries, external tool outputs) are increasingly
prevalent in practice. Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes
messages from each role -- a concept we call \emph{role separation} -- is
crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets
state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such
methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known
triggers. In this paper, we examine \emph{role-separation learning}: the
process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens.
Through a \emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that
fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task
type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data
augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to
iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose
reinforcing \emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting
token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating
position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on
superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our
work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role
behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers.

Abstract: A lively ongoing debate is taking place, since the extraordinary emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) with regards to their capability to understand the

Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought
experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical
linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief
paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and
semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which
prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent
dialogues mean.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决大型语言模型在微调时泛化能力不足的问题，例如无法从简单关系反转或逻辑推理中泛化，这限制了模型的实际应用。通过对比上下文学习的泛化表现，探索改进方法。

Method: 通过构建新数据集来隔离预训练知识的干扰，对比模型在上下文学习和微调下的泛化表现，并提出在微调数据中加入上下文推理的方法。

Result: 研究发现上下文学习在某些情况下比微调表现更灵活，而改进后的微调方法（加入上下文推理）能显著提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结论强调了理解不同学习模式偏置的重要性，并提出改进微调性能的实用方法，为语言模型的实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit exciting capabilities, yet can show
surprisingly narrow generalization from finetuning -- from failing to
generalize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, to missing
logical deductions that can be made from trained information. These failures to
generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.
However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases,
and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these
differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based
learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and
improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are
constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining,
to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to
controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,
or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that
require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched
settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning
(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when
fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of
knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved
generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning
data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of
our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for
understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language
models, and practically improving their performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段框架，通过监督微调和强化学习提升LLM在数学解题中的深度批评能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型快速发展，如何提供准确反馈和可扩展监督成为关键挑战。现有LLM批评模型提供的反馈过于浅显，导致判断准确性低且无法有效纠正错误。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 使用Qwen2.5-72B生成4.5K条长格式批评作为种子数据监督微调；2) 基于PRM800K或自动标注数据通过强化学习进一步优化批评能力。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-7B的批评模型在错误识别基准上显著优于同类模型（包括GPT-4o），并能通过更详细反馈帮助改进错误步骤。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了LLM的数学批评能力，为自动监督提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate
feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical
problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is
a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math
critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too
shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and
struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct
mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage
framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on
each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize
Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for
supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise
critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth
critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform
reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing
human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained
via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize
its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the
same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error
identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator
refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.

Abstract: Memory is a fundamental component of AI systems, underpinning large language
models (LLMs) based agents. While prior surveys have focused on memory
applications with LLMs, they often overlook the atomic operations that underlie
memory dynamics. In this survey, we first categorize memory representations
into parametric, contextual structured, and contextual unstructured and then
introduce six fundamental memory operations: Consolidation, Updating, Indexing,
Forgetting, Retrieval, and Compression. We systematically map these operations
to the most relevant research topics across long-term, long-context, parametric
modification, and multi-source memory. By reframing memory systems through the
lens of atomic operations and representation types, this survey provides a
structured and dynamic perspective on research, benchmark datasets, and tools
related to memory in AI, clarifying the functional interplay in LLMs based
agents while outlining promising directions for future research\footnote{The

Motivation: 尽管LLM在文本改写方面表现强大，但如何通过示例实现任意风格迁移仍具挑战性。研究旨在解决如何描述示例风格以指导LLM生成高质量改写。

Method: 采用基于register分析的提示方法，引导LLM完成风格迁移任务。

Result: 在多个风格迁移任务中，该方法在增强风格迁移强度的同时，更有效地保留了原文含义。

Conclusion: 基于register分析的提示方法为LLM的示例风格迁移提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
rewriting text across various styles. However, effectively leveraging this
ability for example-based arbitrary style transfer, where an input text is
rewritten to match the style of a given exemplar, remains an open challenge. A
key question is how to describe the style of the exemplar to guide LLMs toward
high-quality rewrites. In this work, we propose a prompting method based on
register analysis to guide LLMs to perform this task. Empirical evaluations
across multiple style transfer tasks show that our prompting approach enhances
style transfer strength while preserving meaning more effectively than existing
prompting strategies.

Motivation: 跑步期间的生理反应对性能优化、个性化训练和运动员健康管理至关重要，但传统方法依赖实验室设备。本研究旨在通过穿戴设备数据实现高精度代谢监测，弥合实验室与日常使用的差距。

Method: 结合生理约束ODE和神经卡尔曼滤波建模心率动态，再利用心率模型构建VO$_{2}$预测架构，仅需初始秒级VO$_{2}$数据校准。方法基于智能手表和胸带数据，同步血乳酸测量。

Result: 心率预测平均绝对误差低至2.81 bpm（相关性0.87），VO$_{2}$预测平均百分比误差约13%，能捕捉不同跑步强度下的快速生理变化和稳态。

Conclusion: 框架通过生理约束与机器学习结合，实现了高精度、非侵入式代谢监测，为精英运动员和健身爱好者提供了实验室级精度的日常工具。

Abstract: Understanding physiological responses during running is critical for
performance optimization, tailored training prescriptions, and athlete health
management. We introduce a comprehensive framework -- what we believe to be the
first capable of predicting instantaneous oxygen consumption (VO$_{2}$)
trajectories exclusively from consumer-grade wearable data. Our approach
employs two complementary physiological models: (1) accurate modeling of heart
rate (HR) dynamics via a physiologically constrained ordinary differential
equation (ODE) and neural Kalman filter, trained on over 3 million HR
observations, achieving 1-second interval predictions with mean absolute errors
as low as 2.81\,bpm (correlation 0.87); and (2) leveraging the principles of
precise HR modeling, a novel VO$_{2}$ prediction architecture requiring only
the initial second of VO$_{2}$ data for calibration, enabling robust,
sequence-to-sequence metabolic demand estimation. Despite relying solely on
smartwatch and chest-strap data, our method achieves mean absolute percentage
errors of approximately 13\%, effectively capturing rapid physiological
transitions and steady-state conditions across diverse running intensities. Our
synchronized dataset, complemented by blood lactate measurements, further lays
the foundation for future noninvasive metabolic zone identification. By
embedding physiological constraints within modern machine learning, this
framework democratizes advanced metabolic monitoring, bridging laboratory-grade
accuracy and everyday accessibility, thus empowering both elite athletes and
recreational fitness enthusiasts.

Motivation: 现有的GM-PHD和SMC-PHD滤波器在多目标滤波中各有优劣，作者希望通过结合两者的优势来提升滤波性能。

Method: EnGM-PHD滤波器通过从后验强度函数中获取粒子，利用系统动力学传播，并采用核密度估计技术近似先验强度函数的高斯混合。

Result: 实验结果表明，EnGM-PHD滤波器在多目标滤波中性能优于GM-PHD和SMC-PHD滤波器，且使用相同数量的组件或粒子。

Conclusion: EnGM-PHD滤波器通过结合高斯混合和粒子技术，显著提升了多目标滤波性能，并在特定条件下退化为标准EnGMF滤波器。

Abstract: In this work, a kernel-based Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis
Density (EnGM-PHD) filter is presented for multi-target filtering applications.
The EnGM-PHD filter combines the Gaussian-mixture-based techniques of the
Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter with the
particle-based techniques of the Sequential Monte Carlo Probability Hypothesis
Density (SMC-PHD) filter. It achieves this by obtaining particles from the
posterior intensity function, propagating them through the system dynamics, and
then using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) techniques to approximate the
Gaussian mixture of the prior intensity function. This approach guarantees
convergence to the true intensity function in the limit of the number of
components. Moreover, in the special case of a single target with no births,
deaths, clutter, and perfect detection probability, the EnGM-PHD filter reduces
to the standard Ensemble Gaussian Mixture Filter (EnGMF). In the presented
experiment, the results indicate that the EnGM-PHD filter achieves better
multi-target filtering performance than both the GM-PHD and SMC-PHD filters
while using the same number of components or particles.

Motivation: Python是AI领域的主流开发语言，但常用的库（如PyTorch和TensorFlow）仅依赖BLAS后端的并行化，可能导致性能和扩展性下降。作者希望通过结合异步运行时系统，提升Python库的性能和扩展性。

Result: GPRat在AMD EPYC 7742 CPU上展示了优异的扩展性（支持64核），训练速度优于GPyTorch和GPflow，预测速度分别提升7.63倍和25.25倍。特征数增加时，速度提升更显著（29.62倍和21.19倍）。

Conclusion: 异步任务在Python AI应用中具有巨大潜力，GPRat结合了易用性和高性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial
intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow,
rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on
CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to
performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of
binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a
high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process
(GP) li- brary as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines
the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and
scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the per- formance on a
mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for
varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding
overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to
GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD
EPYC 7742 CPU for train- ing. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction
speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number
of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19,
respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks
within Python-based AI applications.

Motivation: 在许多科学和工程领域，当目标函数和梯度评估计算成本高昂时，高效优化仍是一个基本挑战。现有的零阶优化方法在梯度不可用时虽有效，但因高函数查询成本而性能受限。

Conclusion: BF-SSD通过整合双保真度策略，为大尺度、高维度的实际问题提供了一种计算高效的零阶优化方法。

Abstract: Efficient optimization remains a fundamental challenge across numerous
scientific and engineering domains, especially when objective function and
gradient evaluations are computationally expensive. While zeroth-order
optimization methods offer effective approaches when gradients are
inaccessible, their practical performance can be limited by the high cost
associated with function queries. This work introduces the bi-fidelity
stochastic subspace descent (BF-SSD) algorithm, a novel zeroth-order
optimization method designed to reduce this computational burden. BF-SSD
leverages a bi-fidelity framework, constructing a surrogate model from a
combination of computationally inexpensive low-fidelity (LF) and accurate
high-fidelity (HF) function evaluations. This surrogate model facilitates an
efficient backtracking line search for step size selection, for which we
provide theoretical convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of BF-SSD across four distinct
problems: a synthetic optimization benchmark, dual-form kernel ridge
regression, black-box adversarial attacks on machine learning models, and
transformer-based black-box language model fine-tuning. Numerical results
demonstrate that BF-SSD consistently achieves superior optimization performance
while requiring significantly fewer HF function evaluations compared to
relevant baseline methods. This study highlights the efficacy of integrating
bi-fidelity strategies within zeroth-order optimization, positioning BF-SSD as
a promising and computationally efficient approach for tackling large-scale,
high-dimensional problems encountered in various real-world applications.

Abstract: Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is a relentless challenge in
oncology, with recurrence rates soaring as high as 70-80%. Each recurrence
triggers a cascade of invasive procedures, lifelong surveillance, and
escalating healthcare costs - affecting 460,000 individuals worldwide. However,
existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often
overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for
patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning
framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve
NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for
categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments,
allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes
and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the
data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction
performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides
clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential
features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves
accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical
methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through
feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new
important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and
hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction
models.

Abstract: Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and thyroid disorders, are the leading causes of premature mortality
worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient
outcomes, yet traditional diagnostic methods often fail due to the complex
nature of these conditions. This study explores the application of machine
learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to predict chronic disease and
thyroid disorders. We used a variety of models, including Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT), Neural Networks (NN),
Decision Trees (DT) and Native Bayes (NB), to analyze and predict disease
outcomes. Our methodology involved comprehensive data pre-processing, including
handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature aggregation,
followed by model training and evaluation. Performance metrics such ad
precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used
to assess the effectiveness of each model. The results demonstrated that
ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees consistently
outperformed. Neutral Networks also showed superior performance, particularly
in capturing complex data patterns. The findings highlight the potential of ML
and DL in revolutionizing chronic disease prediction, enabling early diagnosis
and personalized treatment strategies. However, challenges such as data
quality, model interpretability, and the need for advanced computational
techniques in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of
chronic diseases. This study was conducted as part of Big Data class project
under the supervision of our professors Mr. Abderrahmane EZ-ZAHOUT and Mr.
Abdessamad ESSAIDI.

### [74] [Empirical Evaluation of Progressive Coding for Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00190)
*Hans Peter,Anders Søgaard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 稀疏自编码器（SAEs）通过字典学习提取可解释特征，但计算成本高。研究发现其字典重要性遵循幂律，并提出嵌套训练的Matryoshka SAEs，相比剪枝方法在重建损失和表示相似性上表现更好，但剪枝方法更可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器虽然能提取可解释特征，但计算成本高，尤其是在需要多种尺寸SAEs时。因此研究如何高效训练多尺寸SAEs，同时保持性能与可解释性。

Method: 比较了剪枝方法（基于子集修剪）和嵌套训练的Matryoshka SAEs，在语言建模任务中验证两种方法的性能差异。

Result: Matryoshka SAEs在重建损失、语言建模损失恢复和表示相似性上优于剪枝方法，但剪枝方法生成的特征更可解释。

Conclusion: 效率和可解释性之间存在权衡，Matryoshka SAEs更高效，但剪枝方法更可解释，需要根据具体需求选择方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
\citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders}
rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural
networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to
representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however,
computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially
when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary
importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding
based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or
so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs
\citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling
task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured
language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned
vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and
implications of this trade-off.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的流形学习框架，能够从结构化和非结构化的神经影像数据中捕捉个体化空间变化，并在模拟数据和自然主义fMRI数据上表现优于群体基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示低维非线性流形在高维脑活动中的存在对于理解个体差异至关重要，但现有方法大多依赖群体对齐或时间结构假设，无法捕捉个体化特征。

Method: 引入一个流形学习框架，适用于结构化和非时间对齐的神经影像数据，并在模拟和自然主义fMRI数据集（Sherlock和Forrest Gump）上进行验证。

Result: 在精神分裂症患者和健康对照的静息态fMRI数据中，框架能高效扩展到大样本量，并泛化到新受试者，揭示了临床上相关的脑活动模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为脑活动建模提供了可扩展且个体化的工具，适用于计算神经科学和临床研究。

Abstract: Mental and cognitive representations are believed to reside on
low-dimensional, non-linear manifolds embedded within high-dimensional brain
activity. Uncovering these manifolds is key to understanding individual
differences in brain function, yet most existing machine learning methods
either rely on population-level spatial alignment or assume data that is
temporally structured, either because data is aligned among subjects or because
event timings are known. We introduce a manifold learning framework that can
capture subject-specific spatial variations across both structured and
temporally unstructured neuroimaging data. On simulated data and two
naturalistic fMRI datasets (Sherlock and Forrest Gump), our framework
outperforms group-based baselines by recovering more accurate and
individualized representations. We further show that the framework scales
efficiently to large datasets and generalizes well to new subjects. To test
this, we apply the framework to temporally unstructured resting-state fMRI data
from individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We further apply our
method to a large resting-state fMRI dataset comprising individuals with
schizophrenia and controls. In this setting, we demonstrate that the framework
scales efficiently to large populations and generalizes robustly to unseen
subjects. The learned subject-specific spatial maps our model finds reveal
clinically relevant patterns, including increased activation in the basal
ganglia, visual, auditory, and somatosensory regions, and decreased activation
in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and angular gyrus. These findings
suggest that our framework can uncover clinically relevant subject-specific
brain activity patterns. Our approach thus provides a scalable and
individualized framework for modeling brain activity, with applications in
computational neuroscience and clinical research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇综述讨论了生成机器学习在动态制造系统中的应用，提出了四种功能分类方法，分析了生成ML在控制中的潜力及现存的研究空白，并指明了未来的研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态制造过程具有时变参数、非线性行为和不确定性等特点，需要先进的监控技术和自适应控制系统。生成ML能建模复杂分布并生成合成数据，但缺乏将其转化为可操作控制的功能视角。

Method: 作者提出了基于预测、直接策略、质量推理和知识整合的四种功能分类方法，分析了生成ML架构的控制相关特性。

Result: 生成ML在决策制定、过程指导、仿真和数字孪生等方面有潜力，但存在生成与控制功能分离、物理理解不足和跨领域模型适应等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来研究应开发结合生成ML和控制技术的集成框架，以应对现代制造系统的动态复杂性。

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by
time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These
characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing
multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to
real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative
machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex
distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing
uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic
manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to
translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls
while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification
of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated
approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced
control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML
architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties
and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional
methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing
control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and
digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between
generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of
manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To
address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at
developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control
technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于行业标准的生成AI和特征编码器多为黑盒，用户无法优化其内部参数，这使得构建专家混合集成模型变得困难。论文通过非竞争博弈论的视角，解决了这一问题。

Method: 论文提出了一种分散式联合学习算法，每个AI代理在本地优化其结构而不泄露内部参数，并通过反馈机制计算在线环境中的纳什均衡。

Result: 算法在真实世界和合成时间序列基准测试中实现了预测精度数量级的提升，超越了现有基准。

Conclusion: 论文提出的专有联合学习算法有效解决了黑盒AI的集成问题，并展示了在时间序列预测中的显著优势。

Abstract: Most industry-standard generative AIs and feature encoders are proprietary,
offering only black-box access: their outputs are observable, but their
internal parameters and architectures remain hidden from the end-user. This
black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert
type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's
internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive
game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing
against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to
their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the
user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing
AIs.
  We show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting,
which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between
any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI
agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning
algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their
machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain
refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature
models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning''
algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series
benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy
over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this
natural problem still being largely unexplored.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于历史数据的纵向表格Transformer模型（LTT），用于提高停电恢复时间（ETR）预测的准确性，并在实际数据中验证了其优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于气候变化导致自然灾害频发，准确预测停电恢复时间对电力公司和用户至关重要，但现有方法依赖人工或传统统计模型，精度不足。

Method: 采用了Longitudinal Tabular Transformer模型，结合历史停电数据和事件动态更新，并通过34,000次风暴停电事件数据进行评估。

Result: LTT模型将客户满意度影响指标（CSI）平均提升了19.08%，同时引入用户反馈回归指标以增强模型实用性。

Conclusion: LTT模型不仅提高了预测精度，还通过可解释性技术增强了透明度，提升了用户对模型的信任。

Abstract: As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver
precise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has
become increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for
enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed
decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.
Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual
assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the
level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address
these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model
that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of
these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's
performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three
major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a
2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer
Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression
metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the
outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ
interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of
incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the
contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive
approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,
fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the advancements in generative AI, large machine learning models
have revolutionized domains such as image processing, audio synthesis, and

more complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI
inference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement
relative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过自动学习上下文中的成功经验来改进大型语言模型（LLM）代理的决策能力，避免了繁琐的任务特定知识工程。通过构建和优化自生成的轨迹数据库，代理在多个基准测试中表现显著提升。进一步的数据库和轨迹选择方法进一步提升了性能，甚至匹配了更复杂的任务特定方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前改进LLM代理的方法依赖任务特定的知识工程（如提示调整或定制观察空间），效率低下。作者希望探索如何通过自动学习代理自身的成功经验来提升性能，减少人工干预。

Method: 1. 通过积累训练任务中的成功轨迹构建数据库；2. 引入数据库级选择（基于群体训练筛选高性能集合）和样本级选择（基于实际效用保留轨迹）进一步优化。

Result: 在ALFWorld（73%→89%）、Wordcraft（55%→64%）和InterCode-SQL（75%→79%）上表现显著提升。扩展方法使ALFWorld达到91%，匹配复杂任务特定方法的性能。

Conclusion: 自动轨迹数据库构建是一种高效替代知识工程的方法，能显著提升LLM代理的决策能力，减少人工成本。

Abstract: Many methods for improving Large Language Model (LLM) agents for sequential
decision-making tasks depend on task-specific knowledge engineering--such as
prompt tuning, curated in-context examples, or customized observation and
action spaces. Using these approaches, agent performance improves with the
quality or amount of knowledge engineering invested. Instead, we investigate
how LLM agents can automatically improve their performance by learning
in-context from their own successful experiences on similar tasks. Rather than
relying on task-specific knowledge engineering, we focus on constructing and
refining a database of self-generated examples. We demonstrate that even a
naive accumulation of successful trajectories across training tasks boosts test
performance on three benchmarks: ALFWorld (73% to 89%), Wordcraft (55% to 64%),
and InterCode-SQL (75% to 79%)--matching the performance the initial agent
achieves if allowed two to three attempts per task. We then introduce two
extensions: (1) database-level selection through population-based training to
identify high-performing example collections, and (2) exemplar-level selection
that retains individual trajectories based on their empirical utility as
in-context examples. These extensions further enhance performance, achieving
91% on ALFWorld--matching more complex approaches that employ task-specific
components and prompts. Our results demonstrate that automatic trajectory
database construction offers a compelling alternative to labor-intensive
knowledge engineering.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine, as an essential component of traditional
medicine, contains active ingredients that serve as a crucial source for modern
drug development, holding immense therapeutic potential and development value.
A multi-layered and complex network is formed from Chinese medicine to diseases
and used to predict the potential associations between Chinese medicine
ingredients and diseases. This study proposes an ingredient-disease association
prediction model (Node2Vec-DGI-EL) based on hierarchical graph representation
learning. First, the model uses the Node2Vec algorithm to extract node
embedding vectors from the network as the initial features of the nodes. Next,
the network nodes are deeply represented and learned using the DGI algorithm to
enhance the model's expressive power. To improve prediction accuracy and
robustness, an ensemble learning method is incorporated to achieve more
accurate ingredient-disease association predictions. The effectiveness of the
model is then evaluated through a series of theoretical verifications. The
results demonstrated that the proposed model significantly outperformed
existing methods, achieving an AUC of 0.9987 and an AUPR of 0.9545, thereby
indicating superior predictive capability. Ablation experiments further
revealed the contribution and importance of each module. Additionally, case
studies explored potential associations, such as triptonide with hypertensive
retinopathy and methyl ursolate with colorectal cancer. Molecular docking
experiments validated these findings, showing the triptonide-PGR interaction
and the methyl ursolate-NFE2L2 interaction can bind stable. In conclusion, the
Node2Vec-DGI-EL model focuses on TCM datasets and effectively predicts
ingredient-disease associations, overcoming the reliance on node semantic
information.

Conclusion: HFGNN方法有效解决了金融数据跨境共享的隐私问题，并提升了数据联合建模的性能。

Abstract: The sharing of external data has become a strong demand of financial
institutions, but the privacy issue has led to the difficulty of
interconnecting different platforms and the low degree of data openness. To
effectively solve the privacy problem of financial data in trans-border flow
and sharing, to ensure that the data is available but not visible, to realize
the joint portrait of all kinds of heterogeneous data of business organizations
in different industries, we propose a Heterogeneous Federated Graph Neural
Network (HFGNN) approach. In this method, the distribution of heterogeneous
business data of trans-border organizations is taken as subgraphs, and the
sharing and circulation process among subgraphs is constructed as a
statistically heterogeneous global graph through a central server. Each
subgraph learns the corresponding personalized service model through local
training to select and update the relevant subset of subgraphs with aggregated
parameters, and effectively separates and combines topological and feature
information among subgraphs. Finally, our simulation experimental results show
that the proposed method has higher accuracy performance and faster convergence
speed than existing methods.

Motivation: 传统的WCM模型在多样化的农业景观中由于经验成分的限制，其性能表现不佳。为了解决这一问题，本文希望结合深度学习的能力和WCM的物理原理，提高SM估算的准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合深度学习和物理模型，有效克服了WCM的过度简化问题，展示了在多样化农业景观中提高SM估算准确性的潜力。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging
due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface
characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical
approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often
limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research
presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning
approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM)
model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal
dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified
dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and
a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the
soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together
with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A
four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to
assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM
retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation
coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and
surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the
over-simplification in WCM.

Abstract: Accurately estimating human skill levels is crucial for designing effective
human-AI interactions so that AI can provide appropriate challenges or
guidance. In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,
strength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human
skill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a
strength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,
the strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate
player ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that
human players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to
improve the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.
Specifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different
skill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We
then combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to
estimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method
achieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which
increased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous
state-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20
matches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements
in chess. These results contribute to developing a more accurate strength
estimation method and to improving human-AI interaction.

Conclusion: HMFNet通过细粒度特征提取和动态调制优化气味预测，为AI驱动的分子技术发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Molecular odor prediction is the process of using a molecule's structure to
predict its smell. While accurate prediction remains challenging, AI models can
suggest potential odors. Existing methods, however, often rely on basic
descriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder
effective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class
imbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these
challenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature
Mapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local
Multi-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature
extraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor
prediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we
integrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM). This module dynamically
learns feature importance and frequency modulation, improving the model's
capability to capture relevant patterns. Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy
Feature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the
molecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global
information and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction. To
further mitigate the issue of class imbalance, we propose a Chemically-Informed
Loss (CIL). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves performance across various deep learning models, highlighting its
potential to advance molecular structure representation and accelerate the

### [86] [Repetition Makes Perfect: Recurrent Sum-GNNs Match Message Passing Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00291)
*Eran Rosenbluth,Martin Grohe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文证明了具有有限精度参数的循环图神经网络（GNNs）能够模拟任何遵循颜色细化算法自然消息传递不变性的图算法，并展示了其表达能力的极限。此外，通过引入随机初始化，循环GNNs甚至可以模拟所有图算法。

Result: 循环GNNs能够达到颜色细化算法的表达能力极限，且在随机初始化下可模拟多项式时间复杂度的所有图算法。

Conclusion: 循环GNNs的表达能力显著优于非循环版本，且通过随机初始化可进一步扩展其功能，为图算法模拟提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We provide first tight bounds for the expressivity of Recurrent Graph Neural
Networks (recurrent GNNs) with finite-precision parameters. We prove that
recurrent GNNs, with sum aggregation and ReLU activation, can emulate any graph
algorithm that respects the natural message-passing invariance induced by the
color refinement (or Weisfeiler-Leman) algorithm. While it is well known that
the expressive power of GNNs is limited by this invariance [Morris et al., AAAI
2019; Xu et al., ICLR 2019], we establish that recurrent GNNs can actually
reach this limit. This is in contrast to non-recurrent GNNs, which have the
power of Weisfeiler-Leman only in a very weak, "non-uniform", sense where every
graph size requires a different GNN model to compute with. The emulation we
construct introduces only a polynomial overhead in both time and space.
  Furthermore, we show that by incorporating random initialization, recurrent
GNNs can emulate all graph algorithms, implying in particular that any graph
algorithm with polynomial-time complexity can be emulated by a recurrent GNN
with random initialization, running in polynomial time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于动态图结构和时空特征的时间序列预测方法TAEGCN，结合因果时间卷积和多头自注意力机制，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设固定图结构，而实际场景中图结构动态变化，且时间序列的交互在不同时间尺度差异显著。为捕捉准确的时空特征，需要更灵活的模型。

Method: TAEGCN整合因果时间卷积和多头自注意力机制学习节点时间特征，并基于时间特征构建动态图结构，通过统一神经网络生成预测。

Result: 在METR-LA和PEMS-BAY数据集上的实验表明，TAEGCN性能优越。

Conclusion: TAEGCN通过动态图结构和时空特征集成，有效提升了多变量时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting enables the prediction of future states
by leveraging historical data, thereby facilitating decision-making processes.
Each data node in a multivariate time series encompasses a sequence of multiple
dimensions. These nodes exhibit interdependent relationships, forming a graph
structure. While existing prediction methods often assume a fixed graph
structure, many real-world scenarios involve dynamic graph structures.
Moreover, interactions among time series observed at different time scales vary
significantly. To enhance prediction accuracy by capturing precise temporal and
spatial features, this paper introduces the Temporal Attention Evolutional
Graph Convolutional Network (TAEGCN). This novel method not only integrates
causal temporal convolution and a multi-head self-attention mechanism to learn
temporal features of nodes, but also construct the dynamic graph structure
based on these temporal features to keep the consistency of the changing in
spatial feature with temporal series. TAEGCN adeptly captures temporal causal
relationships and hidden spatial dependencies within the data. Furthermore,
TAEGCN incorporates a unified neural network that seamlessly integrates these
components to generate final predictions. Experimental results conducted on two
public transportation network datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed model.

Conclusion: 通过分阶段建模跨时间和跨变量依赖并引入门控机制，该方法显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能和效率，且具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is
available at this repository: https://github.com/nyuolab/Gateformer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoSA是一种基于动态稀疏注意力的新方法，通过选择关键token降低计算复杂度，性能优于传统密集注意力，同时节省资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自注意力机制的二次计算成本问题，提升稀疏注意力方法的实际性能。

Method: 提出MoSA方法，动态选择token实现稀疏注意力，复杂度从O(T²)降至O(k² + T)。

Result: MoSA在相同计算预算下，困惑度最高提升27%，且训练更快、内存占用更少。

Conclusion: MoSA证明了动态稀疏注意力的有效性，为高效Transformer模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models highlighted the excessive quadratic
cost of self-attention. Despite the significant research efforts, subquadratic
attention methods still suffer from inferior performance in practice. We
hypothesize that dynamic, learned content-based sparsity can lead to more
efficient attention mechanisms. We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),
a novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice
routing. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing
arbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of
length $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head
from $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same
computational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the
tested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the
dense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical
compute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense
self-attention. Despite using torch implementation without an optimized kernel,
perplexity-matched MoSA models are simultaneously faster in wall-clock time,
require less memory for training, and drastically reduce the size of the
KV-cache compared to the dense transformer baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于U-Net架构的卷积神经网络（CNN）替代模型，用于加速计算密集型的Cellular-Potts模型（CPM），实现了590倍的加速，并成功模拟了血管生成等复杂生物学行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cellular-Potts模型（CPM）虽然强大，但因显式建模大量个体和偏微分方程（PDEs）而计算昂贵。本研究旨在通过深度学习技术开发高效替代模型，以加快CPM的仿真速度。

Method: 使用U-Net架构的CNN模型，并考虑周期性边界条件，训练该模型预测100个蒙特卡罗步（MCS），替代原有的CPM仿真。

Result: 替代模型实现了590倍的加速，并能有效捕捉原始CPM的血管生成、延伸、连接及血管间隙收缩等行为。

Conclusion: 深度学习可作为CPM的高效替代模型，显著提升计算效率，支持更大规模和更长时间的生物过程模拟。

Abstract: The Cellular-Potts model is a powerful and ubiquitous framework for
developing computational models for simulating complex multicellular biological
systems. Cellular-Potts models (CPMs) are often computationally expensive due
to the explicit modeling of interactions among large numbers of individual
model agents and diffusive fields described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate
model using a U-Net architecture that accounts for periodic boundary
conditions. We use this model to accelerate the evaluation of a mechanistic CPM
previously used to investigate \textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. The surrogate
model was trained to predict 100 computational steps ahead (Monte-Carlo steps,
MCS), accelerating simulation evaluations by a factor of 590 times compared to
CPM code execution. Over multiple recursive evaluations, our model effectively
captures the emergent behaviors demonstrated by the original Cellular-Potts
model of such as vessel sprouting, extension and anastomosis, and contraction
of vascular lacunae. This approach demonstrates the potential for deep learning
to serve as efficient surrogate models for CPM simulations, enabling faster
evaluation of computationally expensive CPM of biological processes at greater
spatial and temporal scales.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 传统压缩感知方法在高维向量恢复中存在局限性，本文提出一种无需调参、轻量级的迭代算法SteinSense，实验证明其在高维向量恢复中的优越性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维向量恢复问题中，传统的凸优化方法（如Basis Pursuit）被证明是次优的，尤其在大B情况下。本文旨在提出一种更优的轻量级算法。

Method: 提出SteinSense，一种无需调参、无需训练数据、无需稀疏性先验知识的迭代算法，基于近似消息传递（Approximate Message Passing）理论。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了SteinSense在高维向量恢复中的高效性和鲁棒性，即使在实际数据或理论条件不满足时仍表现优异。

Conclusion: SteinSense是一种简单、可扩展且理论支撑强的高维向量恢复算法，优于传统凸优化方法。

Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements
rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For
about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been
synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In
the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a
straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex
Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly
when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight
iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not
have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero
knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this
makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume
of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense,
and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate
Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust,
delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under
substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持模型准确性的同时显著降低了通信开销。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为大模型在实际无线联邦学习中的可扩展、资源高效部署提供了可行性。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success across various tasks. Yet, fine-tuning such massive models in federated
learning (FL) settings poses significant challenges due to resource constraints
and communication overhead. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses these issues
by training compact, low-rank matrices instead of fully fine-tuning large
models. This paper introduces a wireless federated LoRA fine-tuning framework
that optimizes both learning performance and communication efficiency. We
provide a novel convergence analysis, revealing how LoRA rank and covariance
effects influence FL training dynamics. Leveraging these insights, we propose
Sparsified Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (\textbf{SOFT}), an adaptive sparsification
method that streamlines parameter updates without expensive matrix
multiplications and singular value decomposition (SVD) operations.
Additionally, we present a Two Stage Federated Algorithm (\textbf{TSFA})
algorithm that pre-determines key parameters offline and dynamically adjusts
bandwidth and sparsification online, ensuring efficient training under latency
constraints. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves
accuracy comparable to ideal scenario models while significantly reducing
communication overhead. Our framework thus enables scalable, resource-efficient
deployment of large models in real-world wireless FL scenarios.

Motivation: 目前文本到视频生成模型在美学和指令遵循上表现优异，但缺乏对基本物理定律的遵守能力，导致不真实甚至误导性的内容。现有评估方法忽略人类判断和物理第一性原理，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 作者提出了T2VPhysBench基准，结合人类评估和第一性物理原理，对开源和商业视频生成模型进行了12项核心物理定律的系统测试，包括牛顿力学和守恒定律等。设计了整体合规性评估、提示干预消融实验和反事实鲁棒性测试。

Result: 所有模型在每个物理定律类别中平均得分低于0.60。详细的物理提示也无法完全避免违规现象，且模型在反事实指令下会明确违反物理规则。

Conclusion: 当前模型在物理规则遵循上仍有严重不足，需进一步研究以实现真正符合物理常识的视频生成。

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have made significant strides in recent
years, producing high-quality videos that excel in both aesthetic appeal and
accurate instruction following, and have become central to digital art creation
and user engagement online. Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to
respect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still
violate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,
and gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading
content. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,
pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus
overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we
introduce \textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that
systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both
open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian
mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark
employs a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted
studies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score
below 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation
revealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics
violations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models
often generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.
The results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer
concrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video
generation.

Motivation: 随着模型规模扩大，传统优化器的训练/微调成本激增，尤其是状态优化器需维护2倍模型大小的辅助信息。SOLO旨在通过轻量化状态设计降低资源需求。

Result: 实验表明SOLO大幅节省内存（如7B模型节省约45GB），且精度损失极小。

Conclusion: SOLO为突破计算资源瓶颈提供可能，有望提升基础研究的可及性。

Abstract: The explosion in model sizes leads to continued growth in prohibitive
training/fine-tuning costs, particularly for stateful optimizers which maintain
auxiliary information of even 2x the model size to achieve optimal convergence.
We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with
extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision
quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit
or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision
as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by
identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem
in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the
rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to
incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored
logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value
for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory
savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy
loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in
computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental
research.

Abstract: Accurate household electrical energy demand prediction is essential for
effectively managing sustainable Energy Communities. Integrated with the Energy
Management System, these communities aim to optimise operational costs.
However, most existing forecasting models are region-specific and depend on
large datasets, limiting their applicability across different climates and
geographical areas. These models often lack flexibility and may not perform
well in regions with limited historical data, leading to inaccurate
predictions. This paper proposes a global model for 24-hour-ahead hourly
electrical energy demand prediction that is designed to perform effectively
across diverse climate conditions and datasets. The model's efficiency is
demonstrated using data from two distinct regions: Ireland, with a maritime
climate and Vietnam, with a tropical climate. Remarkably, the model achieves
high accuracy even with a limited dataset spanning only nine months. Its
robustness is further validated across different seasons in Ireland (summer and
winter) and Vietnam (dry and wet). The proposed model is evaluated against
state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning methods. Simulation results
indicate that the model consistently outperforms benchmark models, showcasing
its capability to provide reliable forecasts globally, regardless of varying
climatic conditions and data availability. This research underscores the
model's potential to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Energy
Communities worldwide. The proposed model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage
Error of 8.0% and 4.0% on the full Irish and Vietnamese datasets.

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices
necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance
the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study
introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages
preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights,
thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed
methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability
across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our
framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the
original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In
comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only
augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential
weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical
model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven
quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization
of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental

Result: 在五个数据集上验证，R&B性能优于或匹配现有方法，仅增加0.01%计算开销。

Conclusion: R&B有效解决数据混合方法的不足，性能优越且计算高效。

Abstract: Data mixing strategies have successfully reduced the costs involved in
training language models. While promising, such methods suffer from two flaws.
First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task
types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving
performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of
domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via
R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity
(Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data
composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients
obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for
additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or
gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and
provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to
non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and
multimodal tasks. With as little as 0.01% additional compute overhead, R&B
matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art data mixing strategies.

Abstract: In data stream clustering, systematic theory of stream clustering algorithms
remains relatively scarce. Recently, density-based methods have gained
attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle
arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining
strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when
data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based
on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream
clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this
paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm
adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity,
summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It
then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final
clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive
Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge
of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and
real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density
data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.

Abstract: Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying
reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific
subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable
methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking
long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that
rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability,
they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible
way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world
graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g.,
relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids,
and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like
Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are
transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs
of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a
graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees)
into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving
diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph
perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify
the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final
prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making
process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in
interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance
akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为SacFL的新型联邦持续学习框架，用于解决设备端模型在数据漂移和对抗任务中的挑战，通过编码器-解码器架构和对比学习实现了存储优化和自主任务检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决设备端机器学习模型在动态数据环境（如数据漂移和对抗任务）中的持续学习问题，同时兼顾隐私和存储限制，论文提出了联邦持续学习（FCL）的解决方案。

Method: SacFL采用编码器-解码器架构分离任务鲁棒和任务敏感组件，减少存储需求，并通过对比学习实现自主数据漂移检测，从而触发持续学习或防御策略。

Result: 在Cifar100和THUCNews等多个数据集上的实验验证了SacFL在类增量和域增量场景中的有效性，并通过演示系统证实了其实用性。

Conclusion: SacFL框架为设备端联邦持续学习提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，能够自主应对数据漂移和对抗任务，同时优化存储资源。

Abstract: The proliferation of end devices has led to a distributed computing paradigm,
wherein on-device machine learning models continuously process diverse data
generated by these devices. The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by
continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device
models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling
machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is
unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this
context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,
preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative
updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor
autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial
tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL
employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and
task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining
lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.
Moreover, $\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an
autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new
task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately
allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without
additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and
THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\rm{SacFL}$ in both
class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios. Furthermore, a demo system
has been developed to verify its practicality.

### [101] [Learning to Estimate Package Delivery Time in Mixed Imbalanced Delivery and Pickup Logistics Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00375)
*Jinhui Yi,Huan Yan,Haotian Wang,Jian Yuan,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的多任务包裹送达时间预测模型TransPDT，用于处理物流行业中取件与送件的混合场景下因时空因素复杂、取件时间严格但数量少、快递员移动模式未被充分探索等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往将取件和送件对快递员决策行为的影响等同看待，而实际上取件因其时间限制更紧对决策影响更大，在混合物流场景中准确预测送达时间对合理分配工作和保证及时服务至关重要。

Method: 设计了TransPDT模型，采用Transformer编码器结构捕捉快递员历史和待处理路径的时空依赖，通过注意力机制在数据不平衡情况下学习取件模式，并将路径预测作为送达时间预测的辅助任务，加入快递员空间移动规律先验。

Result: 在真实行业级数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的优越性。基于TransPDT的系统已在京东物流内部部署，用于跟踪北京每日处理数十万包裹的2000多名快递员。

Conclusion: TransPDT解决了混合物流场景下送达时间预测的关键挑战，通过多任务和注意力机制优化了性能，实际部署证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics
industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service
guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where
couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup
simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and
delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the
pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the
delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three
main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately
interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups
have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it
challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'
spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,
but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,
a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first
employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal
dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.
Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the
imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as
an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior
courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on
real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A
system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more
than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in
Beijing.

*Jianya Lu,Yingjun Mo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过构建基于DQN算法的随机微分延迟方程（SDDE），并估计二者之间的Wasserstein-1距离，分析了DQN的理论行为。研究提供了一个距离上界，并证明随着步长趋近于零，距离也会趋近于零，从而从连续系统角度解释了DQN的体验回放和目标网络技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DQN在强化学习中取得了重大突破，但其理论分析仍然有限。本文旨在通过构建随机微分延迟方程（SDDE）并分析其与DQN的关系，从连续系统的角度理解DQN的核心技术。

Method: 作者基于DQN算法构建了一个SDDE模型，并利用Wasserstein-1距离衡量两者之间的差异。通过引入Lindeberg原理和算子比较方法，证明了距离的上界及其收敛性质。

Result: 研究结果表明，DQN与SDDE模型之间的Wasserstein-1距离随着步长趋近于零而收敛到零，并且SDDE中的延迟项（对应目标网络）有助于系统的稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过SDDE模型，本研究为DQN的体验回放和目标网络技术提供了连续系统的理论解释，并验证了其稳定性和收敛性。

Abstract: Despite the significant breakthroughs that the Deep Q-Network (DQN) has
brought to reinforcement learning, its theoretical analysis remains limited. In
this paper, we construct a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) based
on the DQN algorithm and estimate the Wasserstein-1 distance between them. We
provide an upper bound for the distance and prove that the distance between the
two converges to zero as the step size approaches zero. This result allows us
to understand DQN's two key techniques, the experience replay and the target
network, from the perspective of continuous systems. Specifically, the delay
term in the equation, corresponding to the target network, contributes to the
stability of the system. Our approach leverages a refined Lindeberg principle
and an operator comparison to establish these results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法允许偶尔违反约束，而本文旨在在约束逐渐变化的假设下保持严格的安全，即约束相邻轮次间变化不大。

Method: 采用原始-对偶方法和对偶空间中的在线梯度上升，通过二分化学习率实现零约束违规和次线性遗憾保证。

Result: 在所有轮次中实现了零约束违规，并在动态约束变化下提供了次线性遗憾的保证。

Conclusion: 首次证明了在OCO中面对变化约束时保持绝对安全的理论可行性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present the first theoretical guarantees for zero constraint violation in
Online Convex Optimization (OCO) across all rounds, addressing dynamic
constraint changes. Unlike existing approaches in constrained OCO, which allow
for occasional safety breaches, we provide the first approach for maintaining
strict safety under the assumption of gradually evolving constraints, namely
the constraints change at most by a small amount between consecutive rounds.
This is achieved through a primal-dual approach and Online Gradient Ascent in
the dual space. We show that employing a dichotomous learning rate enables
ensuring both safety, via zero constraint violation, and sublinear regret. Our
framework marks a departure from previous work by providing the first provable
guarantees for maintaining absolute safety in the face of changing constraints
in OCO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DeepSTA的深度时空注意力模型，用于预测物流行业中快递员的准时送达率，尤其在异常情况下表现优异。通过设计异常时空学习模块和异常模式注意力模块，模型有效解决了现有方法在异常场景下的不足，并在真实数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测快递员准时送达率对物流行业至关重要，尤其在异常情况下（如疫情爆发时）现有方法表现不佳。现有研究较少关注物流场景，且未能明确建模异常事件，导致信息丢失。此外，传统数据驱动方法在异常数据稀缺时效果较差。

Method: 提出DeepSTA模型，包括异常时空学习模块（使用RNN建模事件信息）和异常模式注意力模块（利用记忆网络存储异常特征模式）。结合Node2vec、图神经网络和LSTM捕捉时空依赖关系。

Result: 在2022年新冠疫情爆发的真实物流数据集上实验，模型在MAE和MSE指标上分别优于最佳基线12.11%和13.71%。

Conclusion: DeepSTA通过显式建模异常事件和解决数据稀缺问题，显著提升了异常场景下的预测性能，为物流行业提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Prediction of couriers' delivery timely rates in advance is essential to the
logistics industry, enabling companies to take preemptive measures to ensure
the normal operation of delivery services. This becomes even more critical
during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'
delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.
Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many
works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly
model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other
features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous
events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in
these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal
attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we
design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent
neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec
to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks
and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of
couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal
circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a
memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention
mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the
COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by
12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over
multiple competitive baselines.

Abstract: The present research tackles the difficulty of predicting osteoporosis risk
via machine learning (ML) approaches, emphasizing the use of explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) to improve model transparency. Osteoporosis is a
significant public health concern, sometimes remaining untreated owing to its
asymptomatic characteristics, and early identification is essential to avert
fractures. The research assesses six machine learning classifiers: Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting
and utilizes a dataset based on clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables.
The models are refined using GridSearchCV to calibrate hyperparameters, with
the objective of enhancing predictive efficacy. XGBoost had the greatest
accuracy (91%) among the evaluated models, surpassing others in precision
(0.92), recall (0.91), and F1-score (0.90). The research further integrates XAI
approaches, such as SHAP, LIME, and Permutation Feature Importance, to
elucidate the decision-making process of the optimal model. The study indicates
that age is the primary determinant in forecasting osteoporosis risk, followed
by hormonal alterations and familial history. These results corroborate
clinical knowledge and affirm the models' therapeutic significance. The
research underscores the significance of explainability in machine learning
models for healthcare applications, guaranteeing that physicians can rely on
the system's predictions. The report ultimately proposes directions for further
research, such as validation across varied populations and the integration of
supplementary biomarkers for enhanced predictive accuracy.

Motivation: 现有时间序列异常检测方法难以应对跨领域数据分布偏移和非平稳性，导致在异构源领域和新兴目标领域中泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出CICADA框架，包含混合专家（MOE）捕捉领域无关特征、选择性元学习避免负迁移、自适应扩展算法处理新兴领域、分层注意力结构增强可解释性。

Result: 在合成和真实工业数据集上的实验表明，CICADA在跨领域检测性能和可解释性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CICADA通过创新技术有效解决了跨领域异常检测的挑战，为工业应用提供了高性能且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in
applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant
challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which
are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing
models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and
emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce
CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and
Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE)
framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility
and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent
negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion
algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical
attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to
enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and
interpretability.

Motivation: 准确分类医疗器械风险对监管和临床安全至关重要。传统单一模态方法效果有限，需多模态融合。

Method: 提出Transformer框架结合文本和视觉信息，引入交叉注意力捕捉模态依赖，采用自训练策略提升有限监督下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态融合与自训练显著提升分类性能，交叉注意力和伪标注策略在有限监督下增强泛化。

Abstract: Accurate classification of medical device risk levels is essential for
regulatory oversight and clinical safety. We present a Transformer-based
multimodal framework that integrates textual descriptions and visual
information to predict device regulatory classification. The model incorporates
a cross-attention mechanism to capture intermodal dependencies and employs a
self-training strategy for improved generalization under limited supervision.
Experiments on a real-world regulatory dataset demonstrate that our approach
achieves up to 90.4% accuracy and 97.9% AUROC, significantly outperforming
text-only (77.2%) and image-only (54.8%) baselines. Compared to standard
multimodal fusion, the self-training mechanism improved SVM performance by 3.3
percentage points in accuracy (from 87.1% to 90.4%) and 1.4 points in macro-F1,
suggesting that pseudo-labeling can effectively enhance generalization under
limited supervision. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary
benefits of both cross-modal attention and self-training.

Method: 引入动态生成验证集的方法，根据信息量和可行性逐步增加实例大小，并提出系统化生成测试实例的方法以确保覆盖性能。

Result: 在9个领域中，动态验证均改进了GNN策略的扩展行为。

Conclusion: 动态验证集能有效提升策略的扩展能力，优于固定验证集方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that successful per-domain generalizing action policies
can be learned. Scaling behavior, from small training instances to large test
instances, is the key objective; and the use of validation instances larger
than training instances is one key to achieve it. Prior work has used fixed
validation sets. Here, we introduce a method generating the validation set
dynamically, on the fly, increasing instance size so long as informative and
feasible.We also introduce refined methodology for evaluating scaling behavior,
generating test instances systematically to guarantee a given confidence in
coverage performance for each instance size. In experiments, dynamic validation
improves scaling behavior of GNN policies in all 9 domains used.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能灵活处理多样化输入区域和逻辑约束，代码已开源。

Abstract: Neural networks have been shown to frequently fail to satisfy critical safety
and correctness properties after training, highlighting the pressing need for
training methods that incorporate such properties directly. While adversarial
training can be used to improve robustness to small perturbations within
$\epsilon$-cubes, domains other than computer vision -- such as control systems
and natural language processing -- may require more flexible input region
specifications via generalised hyper-rectangles. Meanwhile, differentiable
logics offer a way to encode arbitrary logical constraints as additional loss
terms that guide the learning process towards satisfying these constraints. In
this paper, we investigate how these two complementary approaches can be
unified within a single framework for property-driven machine learning. We show
that well-known properties from the literature are subcases of this general
approach, and we demonstrate its practical effectiveness on a case study
involving a neural network controller for a drone system. Our framework is
publicly available at https://github.com/tflinkow/property-driven-ml.

Result: 该模型能准确预测多个输出序列，不受系统非线性或参数空间维度的影响。

Conclusion: 多输出Transformer模型在预测复杂动态系统输出方面表现出色，同时提供了对输出间相关性的解释。

Abstract: We explore the promising performance of a transformer model in predicting
outputs of parametric dynamical systems with external time-varying input
signals. The outputs of such systems vary not only with physical parameters but
also with external time-varying input signals. Accurately catching the dynamics
of such systems is challenging. We have adapted and extended an existing
transformer model for single output prediction to a multiple-output transformer
that is able to predict multiple output responses of these systems. The
multiple-output transformer generalizes the interpretability of the original
transformer. The generalized interpretable attention weight matrix explores not
only the temporal correlations in the sequence, but also the interactions
between the multiple outputs, providing explanation for the spatial correlation
in the output domain. This multiple-output transformer accurately predicts the
sequence of multiple outputs, regardless of the nonlinearity of the system and
the dimensionality of the parameter space.

Conclusion: DASP方法通过密度感知策略有效减少OOD状态，提高离线强化学习的安全性和性能。

Abstract: The performance of Offline reinforcement learning is significantly impacted
by the issue of state distributional shift, and out-of-distribution (OOD) state
correction is a popular approach to address this problem. In this paper, we
propose a novel method named Density-Aware Safety Perception (DASP) for OOD
state correction. Specifically, our method encourages the agent to prioritize
actions that lead to outcomes with higher data density, thereby promoting its
operation within or the return to in-distribution (safe) regions. To achieve
this, we optimize the objective within a variational framework that
concurrently considers both the potential outcomes of decision-making and their
density, thus providing crucial contextual information for safe
decision-making. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our
proposed method through extensive experimental evaluations on the offline
MuJoCo and AntMaze suites.

Method: 提出一种自消除机制，动态强制k-winner-takes-all约束，促进特征局部化和神经元专业化，在小模型和TinyStories数据集上进行训练和测试。

Result: 发现自消除导致局部电路更集中、特征表示更浓缩、神经元专业化增加，同时全局稀疏性降低，表明局部专业化与可解释性增强相关。

Conclusion: 稀疏性与可解释性之间存在复杂关系，局部专业化而非全局稀疏性更能提升可解释性，且不影响模型性能。

Abstract: A growing intuition in machine learning suggests a link between sparsity and
interpretability. We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate
this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach
dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to
demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike
post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates
interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization
from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing
interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized
circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron
specialization without compromising language modelling performance.
Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that
self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This
reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where
decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization,
leading to enhanced interpretability. To facilitate reproducibility, we make
our code available at

Conclusion: PSV-PPO框架可扩展，未来可融入更多领域知识，进一步提升药物发现中的强化学习应用。

Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug
discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)
has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high
matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a
critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL
phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\%
during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied
in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian
pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To
address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a
novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to
prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike
traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after
generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each
auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also
all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables
early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a
result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive
exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol
benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of
invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and
optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining
validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to
incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing
reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

*Linjing You,Jiabao Lu,Xiayuan Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA)方法，通过线性变换实现实例和相关性对齐，显著提升测试性能，且计算开销极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法仅关注实例级对齐，忽略相关性对齐，且计算复杂、易遗忘领域知识。TCA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出LinearTCA（线性变换实现实例和相关性对齐）和LinearTCA+（插件式模块增强现有方法），无需额外模型更新。

Result: TCA在多项任务中显著超越基线，如在OfficeHome数据集上准确率提升5.88%，GPU内存占用仅4%，计算时间仅0.6%。

Conclusion: TCA通过理论保证和高效实现，为测试时适应提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution
shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a
solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world
scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA),
which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA
methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise
alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source
correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating,
resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting.
  To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate
the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that
correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can
enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we
propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+.
LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and
correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves
as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive
experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods
significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and
backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on
OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6%
computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.

*Amarpal Sahota,Navid Mohammadi Foumani,Raul Santos-Rodriguez,Zahraa S. Abdallah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种名为KnowEEG的新型可解释机器学习方法，用于改进EEG分类的透明性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习在EEG分类中性能优异，但模型可解释性不足，限制了在医疗等关键领域的应用。

Method: KnowEEG结合单电极特征统计测试和电极间连接性特征，使用改进的随机森林模型（Fusion Forest）。

Result: 在五种分类任务中性能达到或超过现有深度学习模型，并提供特征重要性评分以增强可解释性。

Conclusion: KnowEEG不仅提升了EEG分类性能，还通过可解释性为医疗等领域提供了实用价值。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of recording brain activity that
shows significant promise in applications ranging from disease classification
to emotion detection and brain-computer interfaces. Recent advances in deep
learning have improved EEG classification performance yet model explainability
remains an issue. To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce
KnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.
KnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them
using statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity
statistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model
(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode
connectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating
knowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,
KnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep
learning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,
mental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG
classification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG
provides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for
understandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open
classification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge
about the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed
classification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.
Therefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG
explainability is critical such as healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法DFBT，直接预测环境状态而非逐步递归估计，显著减少了累积误差，并在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在延迟观测下通过递归预测状态，容易导致误差累积，DFBT旨在直接预测状态以解决这一问题。

Method: 提出DFBT方法，直接基于观测预测状态，避免递归估计带来的误差累积，理论证明其误差更小。

Result: 在D4RL离线和MuJoCo实验中，DFBT减少了误差并大幅提升了学习效率和性能表现。

Conclusion: DFBT通过直接预测状态显著优于现有递归方法，为延迟强化学习提供了更高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with delays is challenging as sensory perceptions
lag behind the actual events: the RL agent needs to estimate the real state of
its environment based on past observations. State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
typically employ recursive, step-by-step forecasting of states. This can cause
the accumulation of compounding errors. To tackle this problem, our novel
belief estimation method, named Directly Forecasting Belief Transformer (DFBT),
directly forecasts states from observations without incrementally estimating
intermediate states step-by-step. We theoretically demonstrate that DFBT
greatly reduces compounding errors of existing recursively forecasting methods,
yielding stronger performance guarantees. In experiments with D4RL offline
datasets, DFBT reduces compounding errors with remarkable prediction accuracy.
DFBT's capability to forecast state sequences also facilitates multi-step
bootstrapping, thus greatly improving learning efficiency. On the MuJoCo
benchmark, our DFBT-based method substantially outperforms SOTA baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多个领域取得了巨大成功，但其巨大的计算和存储复杂度使其难以微调且在实际应用中受限。

Method: 提出通过交错循环和对角矩阵乘积的因式分解方法，避免构建权重变化矩阵并使用一维快速傅里叶变换（FFT）替代二维FFT。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在不同任务中实现相似或更好的性能，同时显著减少浮点运算（FLOPs）和可训练参数数量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了模型复杂度，提升了微调效率和实用性。

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved tremendous success in different domains.
However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models
difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows
training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of
both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we
propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the
product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address
the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix
into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and
utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental
results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across
various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number
of trainable parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AiT的新型模型，用于解决不规则多元时间序列中的时间依赖建模问题。通过动态调整权重的自适应线性网络和Transformer模块，AiT在预测精度和运行时间上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中多元时间序列常存在采样间隔不规则和缺失值问题，传统线性网络因静态权重难以有效建模，AiT旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: AiT结合了动态调整权重的自适应线性网络和Transformer模块，前者处理序列内不一致性，后者捕捉变量间相关性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，AiT将预测精度提升11%，运行时间减少52%。

Conclusion: AiT在建模不规则时间序列的时空依赖性上表现优异，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance across various
industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate.
Despite the widespread use of linear networks due to their low computational
cost and effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies, most existing
research has concentrated on regularly sampled and fully observed multivariate
time series. However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular
multivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and
missing values. The inherent intra-series inconsistency and inter-series
asynchrony in such data hinder effective modeling and forecasting with
traditional linear networks relying on static weights. To tackle these
challenges, this paper introduces a novel model named AiT. AiT utilizes an
adaptive linear network capable of dynamically adjusting weights according to
observation time points to address intra-series inconsistency, thereby
enhancing the accuracy of temporal dependencies modeling. Furthermore, by
incorporating the Transformer module on variable semantics embeddings, AiT
efficiently captures variable correlations, avoiding the challenge of
inter-series asynchrony. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of AiT, improving prediction accuracy by
11% and decreasing runtime by 52% compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 空间分析的目标是建模空间关系并推断空间过程以从空间数据中生成知识，传统的空间统计方法已被机器学习的灵活性和可扩展性所补充。然而，机器学习的“黑箱”特性限制了对其输出和行为理解，因此XAI成为提升透明度和理解的关键。

Method: 介绍了XAI的关键概念和方法，特别聚焦于基于Shapley值的方法，并将其与空间分析结合。通过2020年美国总统选举的县级投票行为数据，比较了Shapley值与多尺度地理加权回归的应用。

Result: 实证分析展示了Shapley值在空间分析中的有效性，与传统方法相比，XAI能够更好地解释模型的输出和行为，提升了模型的透明度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 当前XAI技术仍存在局限性，但为空间分析领域提供了新的可能性，未来需进一步探索和改进XAI方法以应对复杂空间数据分析的挑战。

Abstract: This chapter discusses the opportunities of eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) within the realm of spatial analysis. A key objective in
spatial analysis is to model spatial relationships and infer spatial processes
to generate knowledge from spatial data, which has been largely based on
spatial statistical methods. More recently, machine learning offers scalable
and flexible approaches that complement traditional methods and has been
increasingly applied in spatial data science. Despite its advantages, machine
learning is often criticized for being a black box, which limits our
understanding of model behavior and output. Recognizing this limitation, XAI
has emerged as a pivotal field in AI that provides methods to explain the
output of machine learning models to enhance transparency and understanding.
These methods are crucial for model diagnosis, bias detection, and ensuring the
reliability of results obtained from machine learning models. This chapter
introduces key concepts and methods in XAI with a focus on Shapley value-based
approaches, which is arguably the most popular XAI method, and their
integration with spatial analysis. An empirical example of county-level voting
behaviors in the 2020 Presidential election is presented to demonstrate the use
of Shapley values and spatial analysis with a comparison to multi-scale
geographically weighted regression. The chapter concludes with a discussion on
the challenges and limitations of current XAI techniques and proposes new
directions.

Motivation: 现有GFM基准缺乏对抗攻击的全面评估，GERM旨在填补这一空白，为研究GFM的对抗鲁棒性提供统一框架。

Method: 采用四种攻击算法和三种防御策略评估五款GFMs的对抗鲁棒性，分析模型架构、量化方案及训练数据的影响。

Result: Transformer架构模型比HyenaDNA更具鲁棒性；对抗攻击倾向于靶向生物重要性区域，表明模型能有效捕捉序列特征。

Conclusion: GERM为GFM对抗脆弱性分析提供了实用框架，揭示了架构设计的重要性及模型对生物特征的敏感性。

Abstract: We propose the first unified adversarial attack benchmark for Genomic
Foundation Models (GFMs), named GERM. Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM
offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess
the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate
the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely
adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our
benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM
vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and
training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater
robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the
impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks
frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that
these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.

Motivation: 无监督学习多组学数据的疾病亚型对个性化医疗至关重要，OmicsCL旨在解决多模态数据整合及生存相关模式学习的挑战。

Method: 采用模块化对比学习框架OmicsCL，结合生存感知对比损失，将基因表达、DNA甲基化等组学数据联合嵌入统一潜在空间。

Result: 在TCGA BRCA数据集中发现临床相关聚类，无监督情况下与患者生存高度一致，且模型对超参数配置鲁棒。消融实验验证生存感知损失提升嵌入预测能力。

Conclusion: OmicsCL证明了对比学习在高维多组学数据中挖掘生物学洞见的潜力，尤其适用于生存相关亚型发现。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a
significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce
OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds
heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and
miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a
survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn
representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on
labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers
clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance
with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across
hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype
coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating
survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned
embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for
biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.

Motivation: 为了解决连续动作空间中强化学习的优化问题，结合确定性策略梯度和经典策略梯度的优势。

Method: 通过将Wasserstein梯度流近似为有限维参数空间的投影，提出了WPO算法。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite和磁约束聚变任务上表现优于现有连续控制方法。

Conclusion: WPO算法结合了多种策略梯度方法的优点，适用于连续控制任务。

Abstract: We introduce Wasserstein Policy Optimization (WPO), an actor-critic algorithm
for reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces. WPO can be derived as
an approximation to Wasserstein gradient flow over the space of all policies
projected into a finite-dimensional parameter space (e.g., the weights of a
neural network), leading to a simple and completely general closed-form update.
The resulting algorithm combines many properties of deterministic and classic
policy gradient methods. Like deterministic policy gradients, it exploits
knowledge of the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the
action. Like classic policy gradients, it can be applied to stochastic policies
with arbitrary distributions over actions -- without using the
reparameterization trick. We show results on the DeepMind Control Suite and a
magnetic confinement fusion task which compare favorably with state-of-the-art
continuous control methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的视频推理数据集MINERVA，旨在解决现有视频基准测试缺乏中间或可解释推理步骤的问题，并提供详细的人工标注推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态LLM专注于视频基准测试，但大多数基准仅提供结果监督，缺乏中间推理步骤，无法评估模型是否真正结合了感知和时间信息进行推理，还是仅仅依赖语言偏差或随机猜对答案。

Method: 构建MINERVA数据集，包含5个答案选项和详细的手工标注推理轨迹，覆盖多模态、多样视频领域和长度，并设计复杂多步问题。通过广泛基准测试和细粒度错误分析，识别常见失败模式并分类。

Result: 基准测试表明MINERVA对现有开源和专有模型构成挑战。错误分析显示主要失败模式为时间定位错误和视觉感知错误，而非逻辑或完整性错误。

Conclusion: MINERVA为评估视频推理提供了更可靠的基准，并揭示了多模态模型的改进方向。数据集将公开以促进研究。

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are turning their focus to video benchmarks, however most
video benchmarks only provide outcome supervision, with no intermediate or
interpretable reasoning steps. This makes it challenging to assess if models
are truly able to combine perceptual and temporal information to reason about
videos, or simply get the correct answer by chance or by exploiting linguistic
biases. To remedy this, we provide a new video reasoning dataset called MINERVA
for modern multimodal models. Each question in the dataset comes with 5 answer
choices, as well as detailed, hand-crafted reasoning traces. Our dataset is
multimodal, diverse in terms of video domain and length, and consists of
complex multi-step questions. Extensive benchmarking shows that our dataset
provides a challenge for frontier open-source and proprietary models. We
perform fine-grained error analysis to identify common failure modes across
various models, and create a taxonomy of reasoning errors. We use this to
explore both human and LLM-as-a-judge methods for scoring video reasoning
traces, and find that failure modes are primarily related to temporal
localization, followed by visual perception errors, as opposed to logical or
completeness errors. The dataset, along with questions, answer candidates and
reasoning traces will be publicly available under

Conclusion: 正态归一化是一种通用且有效的归一化方法，适用于多种神经网络场景，并能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at
the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the
greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an
equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions.
Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of
deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their
effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what
distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved,
been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal
distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality
normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the
feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and
employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments
comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in
regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and
dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of
variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its
suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally
used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.

Abstract: This position paper critically surveys a broad spectrum of recent empirical
developments on human-AI agents collaboration, highlighting both their
technical achievements and persistent gaps. We observe a lack of a unifying
theoretical framework that can coherently integrate these varied studies,
especially when tackling open-ended, complex tasks. To address this, we propose
a novel conceptual architecture: one that systematically interlinks the
technical details of multi-agent coordination, knowledge management, cybernetic
feedback loops, and higher-level control mechanisms. By mapping existing
contributions, from symbolic AI techniques and connectionist LLM-based agents
to hybrid organizational practices, onto this proposed framework (Hierarchical
Exploration-Exploitation Net), our approach facilitates revision of legacy
methods and inspires new work that fuses qualitative and quantitative
paradigms. The paper's structure allows it to be read from any section, serving
equally as a critical review of technical implementations and as a
forward-looking reference for designing or extending human-AI symbioses.
Together, these insights offer a stepping stone toward deeper co-evolution of
human cognition and AI capability.

Abstract: This article deals with the description and recognition of fiber bundles, in
particular nerves, in medical images, based on the anatomical description of
the fiber trajectories. To this end, we propose a logical formalization of this
anatomical knowledge. The intrinsically imprecise description of nerves, as
found in anatomical textbooks, leads us to propose fuzzy semantics combined
with first-order logic. We define a language representing spatial entities,
relations between these entities and quantifiers. A formula in this language is
then a formalization of the natural language description. The semantics are
given by fuzzy representations in a concrete domain and satisfaction degrees of
relations. Based on this formalization, a spatial reasoning algorithm is
proposed for segmentation and recognition of nerves from anatomical and
diffusion magnetic resonance images, which is illustrated on pelvic nerves in
pediatric imaging, enabling surgeons to plan surgery.

Motivation: 研究AI公司和大学在安全与可靠性研究上的差异，揭示知识缺口并提出改进建议。

Method: 分析1,178篇安全与可靠性论文（来自9,439篇生成式AI论文，时间跨度为2020年1月至2025年3月）。

Result: 企业研究集中于部署前问题，部署阶段问题（如偏见）关注下降；高风险领域（如医疗、金融）研究不足。

Conclusion: 应提高部署数据的透明度和可观测性以弥补知识缺口，避免企业研究的过度集中。

Abstract: Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI

companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI
universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of
Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on
pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while
attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant
research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare,
finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and
copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate
concentration could deepen knowledge deficits. We recommend expanding external
researcher access to deployment data and systematic observability of in-market
AI behaviors.

Responsible AI Labs (RAIL) framework, which includes eight measurable
dimensions to assess the normative behavior of large language models (LLMs). We
apply this framework to Anthropic's "Values in the Wild" dataset, containing
over 308,000 anonymized conversations with Claude and more than 3,000 annotated
value expressions. Our study maps these values to RAIL dimensions, computes
synthetic scores, and provides insights into the ethical behavior of LLMs in
real-world use.

*Lo Pang-Yun Ting,Yu-Hao Chiang,Yi-Tung Tsai,Hsu-Chao Lai,Kun-Ta Chuang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DeCo方法，通过构建缺陷感知图和工程师-任务匹配机制优化IC测试任务分配，提高成功率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视缺陷特征、历史故障和工程师经验的整合，限制IC处理效率提升。

Method: 构建缺陷感知图捕获共现故障关系，结合工程师与任务的表示，用对比机制匹配任务与工程师。

Result: 在真实数据集上任务处理成功率超80%，且能平衡工程师工作负载。

Conclusion: DeCo作为AI驱动方案，可高效分配任务并提升IC故障分析能力。

Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital
role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements
in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right
engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies
emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the
integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights
from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC
handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative
approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel
defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships
to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally,
it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced
by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a
contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by
considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable
and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate
that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different
scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both
scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can
assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar
defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world
IC failure analysis and task handling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CognitionNet的两阶段深度神经网络，用于从在线游戏平台数据中挖掘玩家的微观行为模式和持久游戏风格，揭示玩家心理和战术决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏数据可以反映玩家的心理状态和行为模式，挖掘这些信息有助于更好地理解玩家行为、体验和成长需求。

Method: 采用两阶段深度神经网络：第一阶段通过聚类挖掘游戏行为微观模式，第二阶段通过监督分类发现持久游戏风格，并结合‘桥接损失’协同训练。

Result: CognitionNet能自动化地揭示玩家心理和战术，并显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实现了从游戏数据中自动化挖掘玩家心理和战术的目标，为玩家行为预测提供了新的诊断解释方法。

Abstract: Games are one of the safest source of realizing self-esteem and relaxation at
the same time. An online gaming platform typically has massive data coming in,
e.g., in-game actions, player moves, clickstreams, transactions etc. It is
rather interesting, as something as simple as data on gaming moves can help
create a psychological imprint of the user at that moment, based on her
impulsive reactions and response to a situation in the game. Mining this
knowledge can: (a) immediately help better explain observed and predicted
player behavior; and (b) consequently propel deeper understanding towards
players' experience, growth and protection. To this effect, we focus on
discovery of the "game behaviours" as micro-patterns formed by continuous
sequence of games and the persistent "play styles" of the players' as a
sequence of such sequences on an online skill gaming platform for Rummy. We
propose a two stage deep neural network, CognitionNet. The first stage focuses
on mining game behaviours as cluster representations in a latent space while
the second aggregates over these micro patterns to discover play styles via a
supervised classification objective around player engagement. The dual
objective allows CognitionNet to reveal several player psychology inspired
decision making and tactics. To our knowledge, this is the first and
one-of-its-kind research to fully automate the discovery of: (i) player
psychology and game tactics from telemetry data; and (ii) relevant diagnostic
explanations to players' engagement predictions. The collaborative training of
the two networks with differential input dimensions is enabled using a novel
formulation of "bridge loss". The network plays pivotal role in obtaining
homogeneous and consistent play style definitions and significantly outperforms
the SOTA baselines wherever applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构难以应对UAM在扩展性、适应性和资源整合方面的动态复杂挑战，需通过去中心化和AI增强的解决方案提升系统韧性。

Method: 采用智能整体架构，结合LLM处理自然语言输入、生成自适应计划，并通过Holon实现空中出租车、地面交通与垂直起降场的实时协调。

Conclusion: 该研究为去中心化、AI驱动的UAM生态系统奠定基础，未来需探索混合AI整合及现实场景验证。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging System of System (SoS) that faces
challenges in system architecture, planning, task management, and execution.
Traditional architectural approaches struggle with scalability, adaptability,
and seamless resource integration within dynamic and complex environments. This
paper presents an intelligent holonic architecture that incorporates Large
Language Model (LLM) to manage the complexities of UAM. Holons function semi
autonomously, allowing for real time coordination among air taxis, ground
transport, and vertiports. LLMs process natural language inputs, generate
adaptive plans, and manage disruptions such as weather changes or airspace
closures.Through a case study of multimodal transportation with electric
scooters and air taxis, we demonstrate how this architecture enables dynamic
resource allocation, real time replanning, and autonomous adaptation without
centralized control, creating more resilient and efficient urban transportation
networks. By advancing decentralized control and AI driven adaptability, this
work lays the groundwork for resilient, human centric UAM ecosystems, with
future efforts targeting hybrid AI integration and real world validation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理方法在GUI基线和规划阶段存在训练数据不足和忽略历史行为回溯的问题，导致任务执行效果不佳。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了ScaleTrack框架。

Method: ScaleTrack通过收集多样化的GUI样本并统一模板来训练GUI基线模型，同时设计了一种新的训练策略，结合当前GUI图像预测下一步动作并回溯历史行为。

Result: 实验结果表明，ScaleTrack能够有效解释GUI图像与动作之间的对应关系，并显著提升GUI代理的性能。

Conclusion: ScaleTrack通过结合多源数据和回溯策略，为自动GUI代理提供了一种高效的训练框架，改善了任务执行的效果。

Abstract: Automated GUI agents aims to facilitate user interaction by automatically
performing complex tasks in digital environments, such as web, mobile, desktop
devices. It receives textual task instruction and GUI description to generate
executable actions (\emph{e.g.}, click) and operation boxes step by step.
Training a GUI agent mainly involves grounding and planning stages, in which
the GUI grounding focuses on finding the execution coordinates according to the
task, while the planning stage aims to predict the next action based on
historical actions. However, previous work suffers from the limitations of
insufficient training data for GUI grounding, as well as the ignorance of
backtracking historical behaviors for GUI planning. To handle the above
challenges, we propose ScaleTrack, a training framework by scaling grounding
and backtracking planning for automated GUI agents. We carefully collected GUI
samples of different synthesis criterions from a wide range of sources, and
unified them into the same template for training GUI grounding models.
Moreover, we design a novel training strategy that predicts the next action
from the current GUI image, while also backtracking the historical actions that
led to the GUI image. In this way, ScaleTrack explains the correspondence
between GUI images and actions, which effectively describes the evolution rules
of the GUI environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of ScaleTrack. Data and code will be available at url.

Abstract: Agentic AI, with its autonomous and proactive decision-making, has
transformed smart environments. By integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and
multi-agent systems, modern AI frameworks can dynamically adapt to user
preferences, optimize data management, and improve resource allocation. This
paper introduces UserCentrix, an agentic memory-augmented AI framework designed
to enhance smart spaces through dynamic, context-aware decision-making. This
framework integrates personalized Large Language Model (LLM) agents that
leverage user preferences and LLM memory management to deliver proactive and
adaptive assistance. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid hierarchical control
system, balancing centralized and distributed processing to optimize real-time
responsiveness while maintaining global situational awareness. UserCentrix
achieves resource-efficient AI interactions by embedding memory-augmented
reasoning, cooperative agent negotiation, and adaptive orchestration
strategies. Our key contributions include (i) a self-organizing framework with
proactive scaling based on task urgency, (ii) a Value of Information
(VoI)-driven decision-making process, (iii) a meta-reasoning personal LLM
agent, and (iv) an intelligent multi-agent coordination system for seamless
environment adaptation. Experimental results across various models confirm the
effectiveness of our approach in enhancing response accuracy, system
efficiency, and computational resource management in real-world application.

Motivation: 现有分类器模型仅依赖事实，而法律推理需结合事实与规则（如判决理由）。为填补这一空白，论文提出结合规则的分类器框架。

Method: 基于Canavotto等人（2023）的层次化规则推理模型，将规则集融入分类器，并展示新案例如何通过规则推断决策，同时引入时间和法院层级要素。

Result: 开发了支持规则推理的分类器框架，并通过示例验证时间因素和法院层级在新框架中的应用。

Conclusion: 扩展的分类器框架更贴合法律推理需求，为法律领域的案例分析提供了更全面的工具。

Abstract: We extend the formal framework of classifier models used in the legal domain.
While the existing classifier framework characterises cases solely through the
facts involved, legal reasoning fundamentally relies on both facts and rules,
particularly the ratio decidendi. This paper presents an initial approach to
incorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work
of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of
precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how
decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based
classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time
element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier
framework.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨GPT4等大语言模型在战略决策的类比推理中是否能匹敌人类，揭示AI与人类在类比推理中的差异。

Method: 采用新颖的实验设计，通过源目标匹配任务比较GPT4和人类在类比推理中的表现。

Result: GPT4召回率高但准确率低，人类相反；人类在因果映射和深层结构识别上更优，AI错误多源于表面匹配。

Conclusion: 建议分工协作：AI作为广泛类比生成器，人类作为关键评估者，以优化战略决策中的类比应用。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can
match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision
making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target
matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible
analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect
analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants
exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with
stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying
matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that
requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs
are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative
advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error
analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas
human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together,
the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted
organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy
generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most
contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.

Result: 经过严格量化评估，框架在准确性和事实一致性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效增强了MCTS的可解释性，适用于广泛的后验查询和基于知识的探究。

Abstract: In response to the lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) for
sequential planning, we design a Computational Tree Logic-guided large language
model (LLM)-based natural language explanation framework designed for the Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. MCTS is often considered challenging to
interpret due to the complexity of its search trees, but our framework is
flexible enough to handle a wide range of free-form post-hoc queries and
knowledge-based inquiries centered around MCTS and the Markov Decision Process
(MDP) of the application domain. By transforming user queries into logic and
variable statements, our framework ensures that the evidence obtained from the
search tree remains factually consistent with the underlying environmental
dynamics and any constraints in the actual stochastic control process. We
evaluate the framework rigorously through quantitative assessments, where it
demonstrates strong performance in terms of accuracy and factual consistency.

Motivation: 生成式AI模型的无限输入输出空间、缺乏明确定义的真相目标以及强反馈循环等特点，使得传统评估方法失效，尤其泄漏和污染问题成为核心挑战。

Result: AI竞赛的严格性为生成式AI评估提供了未充分利用的有效解决方案框架。

Conclusion: 呼吁领域重视AI竞赛的实践经验，将其作为生成式AI实证评估的标杆并以相应价值利用其结果。

Abstract: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI
is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking
strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models
and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these
models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do
not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong
feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model
outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em
leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult
issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI
Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage
for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition
setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized)
resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold
standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest
their results with according value.

Motivation: 面对集中式IoV解决方案的高延迟、低可扩展性和依赖私有AI模型的问题，本文旨在探索开源LLM在车联网中的应用潜力。

Method: FPoTT采用动态提示优化机制和双层联邦学习架构，结合轻量级边缘模型和云端LLM，并引入Transformer驱动的合成数据生成器。

Result: 实验表明，FPoTT在真实数据上达到99.86%的预测精度，并在合成数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 开源LLM为安全、自适应和可扩展的IoV管理提供了可行方案，是智能交通生态系统的有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and
privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often
suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to
widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive
environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular
systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and
effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel
framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT
introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines
textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a
dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for
real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A
Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training
with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation
(NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing
EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data
while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results
underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and
scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary
solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.

Conclusion: 该框架为多跳MIMO网络中的机器学习任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，兼具性能与实用性。

Abstract: A novel over-the-air machine learning framework over multi-hop multiple-input
and multiple-output (MIMO) networks is proposed. The core idea is to imitate
fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by
carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural
network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with
the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the
corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train
PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification
error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints,
with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then
obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block
extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that
the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory
classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that
higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of
hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Abstract: This article describes the process of creating a script and conducting an
analytical study of a dataset using the DeepMIMO emulator. An advertorial
attack was carried out using the FGSM method to maximize the gradient. A
comparison is made of the effectiveness of binary classifiers in the task of
detecting distorted data. The dynamics of changes in the quality indicators of
the regression model were analyzed in conditions without adversarial attacks,
during an adversarial attack and when the distorted data was isolated. It is
shown that an adversarial FGSM attack with gradient maximization leads to an
increase in the value of the MSE metric by 33% and a decrease in the R2
indicator by 10% on average. The LightGBM binary classifier effectively
identifies data with adversarial anomalies with 98% accuracy. Regression

Conclusion: 论文展示了VLM在保障网络环境安全中的重要应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has provided enhanced communication
channels for individuals to create online content, enabling them to express
their thoughts and opinions. Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or
humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to
disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups. While the detection of
hateful memes is well-researched, developing effective methods to transform
hateful content in memes remains a significant challenge. Leveraging the
powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This
paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting
technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for
mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing
hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分析系统通常局限于预定义任务，难以适应开放场景，且VLM在处理超长视频时上下文窗口受限。

Method: AVA采用事件知识图谱实时索引视频内容，并结合检索生成机制处理复杂查询。

Result: 在LVBench、VideoMME-Long和AVA-100基准测试中，AVA分别达到62.3%、64.1%和75.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: AVA通过创新技术解决了超长视频分析的挑战，在开放场景中实现了高效且准确的分析。

Abstract: AI-driven video analytics has become increasingly pivotal across diverse
domains. However, existing systems are often constrained to specific,
predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical
scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as
transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling
open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their
limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video
content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we
introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video
analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time
construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or
continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism
that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that
AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy,
respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video
analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new
benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours
in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex
question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an
accuracy of 75.8%.

Motivation: 现有PTQ方法采用块级重建，忽略了跨块依赖性，在低比特量化时准确性下降明显。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了Hessian引导的自适应分组机制，将块划分为非重叠组作为重建单元，并提出混合精度量化方法，根据敏感度分配不同比特宽度。

Result: 在2D图像和3D点云分类任务中，使用多种网络架构的实验表明，该方法优于现有PTQ方法。

Conclusion: Pack-PTQ通过自适应分组和混合精度量化，显著提升了低比特量化时的性能，为模型压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has evolved as a prominent solution for
compressing complex models, which advocates a small calibration dataset and
avoids end-to-end retraining. However, most existing PTQ methods employ
block-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a
notable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this
paper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a
Hessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into
non-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby
preserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization
parameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a
mixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs
according to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing
performance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud
classification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the
superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.

Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of multi-temporal satellite imagery for
better functional field boundary delineation using deep learning semantic
segmentation architecture on two distinct geographical and multi-scale farming
systems of Netherlands and Pakistan. Multidate images of April, August and
October 2022 were acquired for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 in sub regions of
Netherlands and November 2022, February and March 2023 for selected area of
Dunyapur in Pakistan. For Netherlands, Basic registration crop parcels (BRP)
vector layer was used as labeled training data. while self-crafted field
boundary vector data were utilized for Pakistan. Four deep learning models with
UNET architecture were evaluated using different combinations of multi-date
images and NDVI stacks in the Netherlands subregions. A comparative analysis of
IoU scores assessed the effectiveness of the proposed multi-date NDVI stack
approach. These findings were then applied for transfer learning, using
pre-trained models from the Netherlands on the selected area in Pakistan.
Additionally, separate models were trained using self-crafted field boundary
data for Pakistan, and combined models were developed using data from both the
Netherlands and Pakistan. Results indicate that multi-date NDVI stacks provide
additional temporal context, reflecting crop growth over different times of the
season. The study underscores the critical role of multi-scale ground
information from diverse geographical areas in developing robust and
universally applicable models for field boundary delineation. The results also
highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution for extraction of field
boundaries in regions with small scale framing. The findings can be extended to
multi-scale implementations for improved automatic field boundary delineation
in heterogeneous agricultural environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气体泄漏对人类健康和环境构成重大风险，但由于其隐蔽性和随机形状，现有方法难以高效准确地检测和分割。

Method: 提出FGSTP算法，通过构建相关性体积捕获帧间运动信息，逐步细化对象级特征，并使用解码器优化边界分割。

Result: 在手动标注的GasVid数据集上，FGSTP算法表现优于其他SOTA模型，生成了最精确的掩码。

Conclusion: FGSTP算法在气体泄漏分割任务中表现出色，为解决隐蔽和随机形状问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite
long-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and
accurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and
random shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal
Perception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical
motion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in
an end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to
capture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained
perception progressively refines the object-level features using previous
outputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.
Because there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,
we manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on
GasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such
as gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于深度学习的质量评估方法，通过贝叶斯序数分类（BOC）和校准的不确定性阈值，评估放射治疗中的自动生成轮廓（auto-contours），无需依赖真实轮廓或大量手动标注，显著提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在线自适应放射治疗（OART）中自动生成轮廓的质量评估问题，减少对手动标注的依赖，提升临床决策的效率和可靠性。

Method: 开发了BOC模型来分类轮廓质量并量化预测不确定性，通过校准步骤优化不确定性阈值。在三种数据场景（无手动标注、有限标注、大量标注）下验证方法，使用几何代理标签、迁移学习或直接监督。

Result: BOC模型在所有场景中表现稳健，仅需30个手动标注和34例校准即可达到超90%的测试准确率。校准阈值下，93%的轮廓质量预测准确率在98%的案例中实现，减少了不必要的手动检查。

Conclusion: 该QA模型通过减少手动工作量并支持快速临床决策，提升了OART的轮廓绘制效率。不确定性量化确保了放射治疗工作流程更安全可靠。

Abstract: Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment
(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in
radiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging
Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,
the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth
contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to
classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A
calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical
accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual
labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate
cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,
transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were
available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all
scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34
subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated
threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted
in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting
cases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring
efficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed
clinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more
reliable radiotherapy workflows.

TL;DR: 提出NVTM方法，通过分解视频为带光流信息的2D网格，加速训练并提升参数效率，在视频质量与编码速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于网格的隐式神经表示（INR）方法因未考虑视频动态特性导致参数冗余，NVTM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将时空3D视频数据分解为带光流信息的2D网格，实现高效参数学习与快速编码。

Result: 编码速度提升3倍以上，PSNR/LPIPS指标显著优于网格方法，且在压缩任务中媲美H.264/HEVC标准。

Conclusion: NVTM在视频表示与压缩任务中表现优越，具有广泛适用性如超分辨率、插帧等。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications
across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up
training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art
approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a
faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid
usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant
use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter
efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a
parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video
representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework
that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the
spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,
NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter
efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels
at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video
quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed
increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019
improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)
and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),
compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,
we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,
HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform
extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm
across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and
video inpainting. Project page is https://sujiikim.github.io/NVTM/.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型的帧看起来真实，但运动效果差，而FVD等方法无法很好地评估这一问题，因此需要新的评估指标。

Method: 通过自动编码点轨迹提取运动特征，用于比较视频分布（如生成视频与真实视频）或单视频运动评估。

Result: 点轨迹方法对合成数据的时间失真更敏感，能比现有方法更好地预测人类对时间一致性和真实性的评价，并能定位时空不一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了生成视频运动评估的准确性，并提供了更高的可解释性。

Abstract: A current limitation of video generative video models is that they generate
plausible looking frames, but poor motion -- an issue that is not well captured
by FVD and other popular methods for evaluating generated videos. Here we go
beyond FVD by developing a metric which better measures plausible object
interactions and motion. Our novel approach is based on auto-encoding point
tracks and yields motion features that can be used to not only compare
distributions of videos (as few as one generated and one ground truth, or as
many as two datasets), but also for evaluating motion of single videos. We show
that using point tracks instead of pixel reconstruction or action recognition
features results in a metric which is markedly more sensitive to temporal
distortions in synthetic data, and can predict human evaluations of temporal
consistency and realism in generated videos obtained from open-source models
better than a wide range of alternatives. We also show that by using a point
track representation, we can spatiotemporally localize generative video
inconsistencies, providing extra interpretability of generated video errors
relative to prior work. An overview of the results and link to the code can be
found on the project page: http://trajan-paper.github.io.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how
chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance.
However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel
reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a
bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT
that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the
semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the
token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch
generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce
BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes
both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning
strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance
with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE
benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1. Code is available

Conclusion: JointDiT通过联合分布建模，成功实现了高质量的图像和深度图生成，并展示了在多任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint
distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and
outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT
not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically
plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is
achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, i.e.,
adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality,
and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train
our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to
naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint
generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply
controlling the timestep of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding
joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in
depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint
distribution modeling can serve as a replaceable alternative to conditional
generation. The project page is available at

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution is a fundamental problem in computer vision with broad
applications spacing from medical imaging to satellite analysis. The ability to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for
enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While
deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality
reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains
challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches
leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often
struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work,
we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet
preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new
quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply
apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the
conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are
dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also
leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion.
Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing
approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will
be available after the revision process.

Conclusion: BM-MAE灵活实用，显著提升多模态MRI数据分析效率，具有临床价值。

Abstract: Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of
investigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial
insights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker
identification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models
learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This
behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often
scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a
challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are
available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing
modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or
specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a
common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality
combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for
clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling
pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained
model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting
rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This
allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural
changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of
modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy
outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate
pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training
from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and
efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.

Abstract: We address the 3D reconstruction of human faces from a single RGB image. To
this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers
which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization
of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO
foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate
prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face
datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over
1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a
FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the
uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new
benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity
facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark
is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry. Ultimately,
our method outperforms the most competitive baselines by over 15% in terms of

TL;DR: UMKD框架通过不确定性感知多专家知识蒸馏，解决医学图像分级中的域偏移和数据不平衡问题，提升模型鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像自动分级中因域偏移和数据不平衡导致的模型偏差问题，以提高临床应用的部署效果。

Method: 提出UMKD框架，通过任务无关和任务特定特征的解耦，结合不确定性感知的动态蒸馏权重调整，实现多专家模型到单一学生模型的知识转移。

Result: 在SICAPv2和APTOS数据集上的实验表明，UMKD在源域和目标域不平衡场景下均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: UMKD为真实世界的疾病图像分级提供了鲁棒且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic disease image grading is a significant application of artificial
intelligence for healthcare, enabling faster and more accurate patient
assessments. However, domain shifts, which are exacerbated by data imbalance,
introduce bias into the model, posing deployment difficulties in clinical
applications. To address the problem, we propose a novel
\textbf{U}ncertainty-aware \textbf{M}ulti-experts \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{D}istillation (UMKD) framework to transfer knowledge from multiple
expert models to a single student model. Specifically, to extract
discriminative features, UMKD decouples task-agnostic and task-specific
features with shallow and compact feature alignment in the feature space. At
the output space, an uncertainty-aware decoupled distillation (UDD) mechanism
dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer weights based on expert model
uncertainties, ensuring robust and reliable distillation. Additionally, UMKD
also tackles the problems of model architecture heterogeneity and distribution
discrepancies between source and target domains, which are inadequately tackled
by previous KD approaches. Extensive experiments on histology prostate grading
(\textit{SICAPv2}) and fundus image grading (\textit{APTOS}) demonstrate that
UMKD achieves a new state-of-the-art in both source-imbalanced and
target-imbalanced scenarios, offering a robust and practical solution for
real-world disease image grading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统饮食监控依赖自我报告数据，易产生误差；该方法旨在通过3D模型技术提供更准确的饮食行为监测，以预防肥胖、糖尿病等健康风险。

Method: 利用COLMAP和姿态估计算法从单目2D视频生成3D食物模型，并通过体积变化实时监测摄入行为，同时提出自动化状态识别以提升模型准确性。

Conclusion: 3D重建技术为饮食行为监测提供了新思路，有望推动自动化、高精度饮食监控工具的发展。

Abstract: Monitoring dietary habits is crucial for preventing health risks associated
with overeating and undereating, including obesity, diabetes, and
cardiovascular diseases. Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on
self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies.
This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by
leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and
pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food,
allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments
with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential.
Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition
challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The
3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary
behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and
accurate dietary monitoring tools.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的框架，用于优化空气净化棚的放置，以改善德里的空气质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德里作为全球污染最严重的城市之一，传统的静态空气净化策略效果有限，亟需动态优化的解决方案来应对复杂的城市环境。

Method: 采用了近端策略优化（PPO）算法，结合多种空间和环境因素（如人口密度、交通模式等），迭代学习高影响位置。

Result: 实验表明，DRL框架在AQI改善、覆盖范围等方面优于传统方法，实现了空气净化基础设施的均衡分布。

Conclusion: AI驱动的空间优化在智能城市建设和数据驱动的空气质量管理中具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.

Motivation: Understanding webpages is challenging due to visual complexity and numerous interface elements, which complicates accurate action selection.

Method: The approach dynamically zooms in on relevant regions and uses an image-as-map mechanism to visualize key landmarks, aiding action selection.

Result: Performance gains of 28% and 24% were observed on Screenspot-pro and WebVoyager benchmarks, with a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6%.

Conclusion: RegionFocus effectively improves grounding accuracy in interactive settings and sets a new benchmark performance.

Abstract: We introduce RegionFocus, a visual test-time scaling approach for Vision
Language Model Agents. Understanding webpages is challenging due to the visual
complexity of GUI images and the large number of interface elements, making
accurate action selection difficult. Our approach dynamically zooms in on
relevant regions, reducing background clutter and improving grounding accuracy.
To support this process, we propose an image-as-map mechanism that visualizes
key landmarks at each step, providing a transparent action record and enables
the agent to effectively choose among action candidates. Even with a simple
region selection strategy, we observe significant performance gains of 28+\% on
Screenspot-pro and 24+\% on WebVoyager benchmarks on top of two
state-of-the-art open vision language model agents, UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL,
highlighting the effectiveness of visual test-time scaling in interactive
settings. We achieve a new state-of-the-art grounding performance of 61.6\% on
the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark by applying RegionFocus to a Qwen2.5-VL-72B model.
Our code will be released publicly at https://github.com/tiangeluo/RegionFocus.

Abstract: Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Identifying key biomarkers for COVID-19 from high-dimensional multi-omics
data is critical for advancing both diagnostic and pathogenesis research. In
this study, we evaluated the applicability of the Quantum Support Vector
Machine (QSVM) algorithm for biomarker-based classification of COVID-19.
Proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers from two independent datasets were ranked
by importance using ridge regression and grouped accordingly. The top- and
bottom-ranked biomarker sets were then used to train and evaluate both
classical SVM (CSVM) and QSVM models, serving as predictive and negative
control inputs, respectively. The QSVM was implemented with multiple quantum
kernels, including amplitude encoding, angle encoding, the ZZ feature map, and
the projected quantum kernel. Across various experimental settings, QSVM
consistently achieved classification performance that was comparable to or
exceeded that of CSVM, while reflecting the importance rankings by ridge
regression. Although the experiments were conducted in numerical simulation,
our findings highlight the potential of QSVM as a promising approach for
multi-omics data analysis in biomedical research.

Abstract: We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for
fraud detection that integrates a classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network with a variational quantum circuit. By leveraging quantum phenomena
such as superposition and entanglement, our model enhances the feature
representation of sequential transaction data, capturing complex non-linear
patterns that are challenging for purely classical models. A comprehensive data
preprocessing pipeline is employed to clean, encode, balance, and normalize a
credit card fraud dataset, ensuring a fair comparison with baseline models.
Notably, our hybrid approach achieves per-epoch training times in the range of
45-65 seconds, which is significantly faster than similar architectures
reported in the literature, where training typically requires several minutes
per epoch. Both classical and quantum gradients are jointly optimized via a
unified backpropagation procedure employing the parameter-shift rule for the
quantum parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate competitive
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score relative to a
conventional LSTM baseline. These results underscore the promise of hybrid
quantum-classical techniques in advancing the efficiency and performance of
fraud detection systems.

Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA) promise efficient
solutions to classically intractable combinatorial optimization problems by
harnessing shallow-depth quantum circuits. Yet, their performance and
scalability often hinge on effective parameter optimization, which remains
nontrivial due to rugged energy landscapes and hardware noise. In this work, we
introduce a quantum meta-learning framework that combines quantum neural
networks, specifically Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) architectures,
with QAOA. By training the QLSTM optimizer on smaller graph instances, our
approach rapidly generalizes to larger, more complex problems, substantially
reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. Through
comprehensive benchmarks on Max-Cut and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model
instances, we demonstrate that QLSTM-based optimizers converge faster and
achieve higher approximation ratios compared to classical baselines, thereby
offering a robust pathway toward scalable quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Effective data visualization requires not only technical proficiency but also
a deep understanding of the domain-specific context in which data exists. This
context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and

analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and
allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured
knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We

Abstract: To address the challenges of high resource dynamism and intensive task
concurrency in microservice systems, this paper proposes an adaptive resource
scheduling method based on the A3C reinforcement learning algorithm. The
scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, where policy and
value networks are jointly optimized to enable fine-grained resource allocation
under varying load conditions. The method incorporates an asynchronous
multi-threaded learning mechanism, allowing multiple agents to perform parallel
sampling and synchronize updates to the global network parameters. This design
improves both policy convergence efficiency and model stability. In the
experimental section, a real-world dataset is used to construct a scheduling
scenario. The proposed method is compared with several typical approaches
across multiple evaluation metrics, including task delay, scheduling success
rate, resource utilization, and convergence speed. The results show that the
proposed method delivers high scheduling performance and system stability in
multi-task concurrent environments. It effectively alleviates the resource
allocation bottlenecks faced by traditional methods under heavy load,
demonstrating its practical value for intelligent scheduling in microservice
systems.

Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) possess human-like abilities to
solve a wide range of real-world problems, exemplifying the potential of
experts in various domains and modalities. By leveraging the communication and
computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices, edge LAM
emerges as an enabling technology to empower the delivery of various real-time
intelligent services in 6G. Unlike traditional edge artificial intelligence
(AI) that primarily supports a single task using small models, edge LAM is
featured by the need of the decomposition and distributed deployment of large
models, and the ability to support highly generalized and diverse tasks.
However, due to limited communication, computation, and storage resources over
wireless networks, the vast number of trainable neurons and the substantial
communication overhead pose a formidable hurdle to the practical deployment of
edge LAMs. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and challenges of
edge LAMs from the perspectives of model decomposition and resource management.
Specifically, we propose collaborative fine-tuning and full-parameter training
frameworks, alongside a microservice-assisted inference architecture, to
enhance the deployment of edge LAM over wireless networks. Additionally, we
investigate the application of edge LAM in air-interface designs, focusing on
channel prediction and beamforming. These innovative frameworks and
applications offer valuable insights and solutions for advancing 6G technology.

Conclusion: D-Tracker是一种高效、可解释的社交媒体活动数据流建模和预测方法。

Abstract: Large quantities of social activity data, such as weekly web search volumes
and the number of new infections with infectious diseases, reflect peoples'
interests and activities. It is important to discover temporal patterns from
such data and to forecast future activities accurately. However, modeling and
forecasting social activity data streams is difficult because they are
high-dimensional and composed of multiple time-varying dynamics such as trends,
seasonality, and interest diffusion. In this paper, we propose D-Tracker, a
method for continuously capturing time-varying temporal patterns within social
activity tensor data streams and forecasting future activities. Our proposed
method has the following properties: (a) Interpretable: it incorporates the
partial differential equation into a tensor decomposition framework and
captures time-varying temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and
interest diffusion between locations in an interpretable manner; (b) Automatic:
it has no hyperparameters and continuously models tensor data streams fully
automatically; (c) Scalable: the computation time of D-Tracker is independent
of the time series length. Experiments using web search volume data obtained
from GoogleTrends, and COVID-19 infection data obtained from COVID-19 Open Data
Repository show that our method can achieve higher forecasting accuracy in less
computation time than existing methods while extracting the interest diffusion
between locations. Our source code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 尽管经济学家已将文本、图像等非结构化数据用于分析，但神经网络预测的潜在偏差可能影响估计结果。需要一种方法来解决这种偏差并提升推断的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MARS为利用非结构化数据进行推断提供了统一、高效的解决方案，尤其适用于现有文献中未被充分研究的常见场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a general framework for conducting efficient and robust
inference on parameters derived from unstructured data, which include text,
images, audio, and video. Economists have long incorporated data extracted from
texts and images into their analyses, a practice that has accelerated with
advancements in deep neural networks. However, neural networks do not
generically produce unbiased predictions, potentially propagating bias to
estimators that use their outputs. To address this challenge, we reframe
inference with unstructured data as a missing structured data problem, where
structured data are imputed from unstructured inputs using deep neural
networks. This perspective allows us to apply classic results from
semiparametric inference, yielding valid, efficient, and robust estimators
based on unstructured data. We formalize this approach with MARS (Missing At
Random Structured Data), a unifying framework that integrates and extends
existing methods for debiased inference using machine learning predictions,
linking them to a variety of older, familiar problems such as causal inference.
We develop robust and efficient estimators for both descriptive and causal
estimands and address challenges such as inference using aggregated and
transformed predictions from unstructured data. Importantly, MARS applies to
common empirical settings that have received limited attention in the existing
literature. Finally, we reanalyze prominent studies that use unstructured data,
demonstrating the practical value of MARS.

Abstract: We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The
estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost
and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator.
Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little
computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net
to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial
trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model
that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator
on 14 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high
accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally,
pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible
to researchers and practitioners.

TL;DR: 该研究首次对匿名化病理语音进行了全面的以人为中心的分析，发现尽管匿名化技术能有效保护隐私，但会显著降低语音质量，且对不同病理的影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于探索匿名化技术对病理语音的感知影响，因为目前这类技术对语音质量和诊断效用的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 方法包括使用先进的匿名化技术处理180位不同病理（如唇腭裂、构音障碍等）和健康对照者的语音，并由10名母语和非母语的德语听众进行感知评估。

Result: 结果显示匿名化虽保持高识别准确度（91%-93%），但显著降低语音质量（从83%降至59%），且对不同病理的感知影响差异显著。

Conclusion: 结论强调了需开发针对特定病理和情境的匿名化策略，以兼顾隐私保护与语音的沟通和诊断功能。

Abstract: Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of
pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain
understudied. This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered
analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual
protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse
linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated
anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and
Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls.
Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error
rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination
and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot
(repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91%
zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA:
p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization
consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with
pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native
listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners
(Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization
(Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically,
human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical
utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed,
disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy
while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic
utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.

that this can be overcome by including either skip connections or neurons with
linear activation. We provide lower and upper bounds for the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimensions and approximation rates of these network
classes. As an application, we derive statistical convergence rates for DHN
fits in the nonparametric regression model.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in
reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured
confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy
evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and
assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel
identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value
for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this
identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a
policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that
maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound
of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world
application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed methodology.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于预训练的策略，利用与预后相关的因素来预测治疗效果的异质性，以提高对条件平均处理效应（CATE）的估计准确性和统计功效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多领域中（如个性化医疗和教育政策），准确估计异质性治疗效果是优化决策的关键。尽管机器学习在因果估计中提供了灵活性，但在存在大量协变量的情况下，准确估计CATE仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 该方法在R-learner框架内实施，通过基于残差损失的个体预测问题来估计CATE。研究利用了“辅助信息”，开发能够利用风险预测与因果效应估计之间协同作用的模型。

Result: 在存在这些协同作用的场景中，跨任务学习方法能够提高信号检测的准确性，降低估计误差和假发现率，并增强检测异质性的统计功效。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过利用预后因素与治疗效果异质性之间的关联，可以提高CATE估计的准确性，为因果推断和决策提供更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental
challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized
medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning
has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible
effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment
effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many
covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a
phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the
outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In
medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways
frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically,
we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the
CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We
use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that
can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In
settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables
more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false
discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前，机器学习在流行病学中的假设自由发现中虽能发现非线性和交互作用，但缺乏可靠的推断方法，现有特征效应测量的不确定性量化不足。

Method: 提出了RuleSHAP框架，整合稀疏贝叶斯回归、树集成和Shapley值，通过一步程序实现个体层面的复杂模式检测与测试，并推导了高效计算边际Shapley值的公式。

Result: 在模拟数据中验证了框架的有效性，并在真实流行病学数据中成功检测和推断出高胆固醇和高血压的非线性交互效应（如年龄、性别、BMI等）。

Conclusion: RuleSHAP为流行病学中的假设自由发现提供了一种可靠且高效的方法，能够检测并推断复杂的个体层面模式。

Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for
hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is
strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently
compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature
effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for
these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory.
We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free
discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley
values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at
the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes
marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the
validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our
machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several
effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction
effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯最优公平分类器的理论研究通常仅考虑单一（二元）敏感特征，而实践中个体往往由多个敏感特征定义。本文旨在填补这一空白，探讨多敏感特征下的公平分类问题。

Method: 作者通过线性变换将近似公平度量（如均值差异和均值比）与特定群体的选择率关联起来，并提出了基于实例相关阈值规则的贝叶斯最优公平分类器框架。该框架适用于属性感知和属性盲设置，并可复合公平概念（如均衡几率）。基于此，作者提出了两种实用算法（处理中和处理后）。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在贝叶斯最优公平分类任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文框架为多敏感特征下的公平分类问题提供了理论基础和实用解决方案，扩展了现有研究的适用范围，并展示了算法的实际优势。

Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers
a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined
by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the
Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general
approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We
show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions,
including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and
Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific
groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that
Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become
instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these
group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware
and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions
like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for
Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We
show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过量化和降维技术优化检索增强生成模型的存储问题，发现float8量化与PCA降维结合能实现8倍压缩且性能损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维向量嵌入（float32精度）在大规模存储时面临内存挑战，需优化存储策略。

Method: 系统评估量化（float16/int8/binary/float8）和降维（PCA/Kernel PCA/UMAP等）技术在MTEB基准上的表现。

Result: float8量化实现4倍存储压缩且性能损失<0.3%，结合50% PCA可达8倍压缩，优于单独使用int8。

Conclusion: 提出可视化性能-存储权衡空间的方法，帮助用户根据内存限制选择最优配置，float8+PCA为推荐方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation enhances language models by retrieving
relevant information from external knowledge bases, relying on high-dimensional
vector embeddings typically stored in float32 precision. However, storing these
embeddings at scale presents significant memory challenges. To address this
issue, we systematically investigate on MTEB benchmark two complementary
optimization strategies: quantization, evaluating standard formats (float16,
int8, binary) and low-bit floating-point types (float8), and dimensionality
reduction, assessing methods like PCA, Kernel PCA, UMAP, Random Projections and
Autoencoders. Our results show that float8 quantization achieves a 4x storage
reduction with minimal performance degradation (<0.3%), significantly
outperforming int8 quantization at the same compression level, being simpler to
implement. PCA emerges as the most effective dimensionality reduction
technique. Crucially, combining moderate PCA (e.g., retaining 50% dimensions)
with float8 quantization offers an excellent trade-off, achieving 8x total
compression with less performance impact than using int8 alone (which provides
only 4x compression). To facilitate practical application, we propose a
methodology based on visualizing the performance-storage trade-off space to
identify the optimal configuration that maximizes performance within their
specific memory constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG基准测试主要使用公共数据（如维基百科），缺乏对私有数据的评估，而RAG在企业中的应用需要处理私有文档，因此需要新的基准测试。

Method: 作者发布了EnronQA基准测试，包含103,638封电子邮件和528,304个问答对，覆盖150个用户邮箱，用于评估RAG流水线在私有数据上的表现。

Result: EnronQA能够更好地评估RAG在私有数据上的性能，并支持个性化检索设置的实验。

Conclusion: EnronQA为RAG在私有数据上的研究提供了重要工具，同时探讨了在私有文档推理中记忆与检索的权衡。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular
methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to large language models (LLM)
because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the
cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of
private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many
enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's
understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for
private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for
validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data
such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context.
Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA
benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs
across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG
pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction
of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA
to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over
private documents.

Conclusion: 结论是Task Arithmetic是零样本学习和模型适应的有效策略，并提供了其优势和局限性的深入分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document
re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains,
largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we
investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs
pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations,
such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring
additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and
domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation
in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available
scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves
state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in
P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into
the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for
zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at

Conclusion: ChebyCF通过图谱过滤有效提升了推荐的性能，展示了在协同过滤中利用全频谱信号和非线性滤波器的重要价值。

Abstract: Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative
filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks
in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent
space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially
valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is
limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a
fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these
limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum
and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a
CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,
it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of
signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively
approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by
using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through
extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned
bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces
major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task
planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in
response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task
requirements. To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper
proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV
swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs)
is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting
them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target
tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV
motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of
emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted
across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior
performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to
dynamic changes.

Abstract: The development of novel autonomous underwater gliders has been hindered by
limited shape diversity, primarily due to the reliance on traditional design
tools that depend heavily on manual trial and error. Building an automated
design framework is challenging due to the complexities of representing glider
shapes and the high computational costs associated with modeling complex
solid-fluid interactions. In this work, we introduce an AI-enhanced automated
computational framework designed to overcome these limitations by enabling the
creation of underwater robots with non-trivial hull shapes. Our approach
involves an algorithm that co-optimizes both shape and control signals,
utilizing a reduced-order geometry representation and a differentiable
neural-network-based fluid surrogate model. This end-to-end design workflow
facilitates rapid iteration and evaluation of hydrodynamic performance, leading
to the discovery of optimal and complex hull shapes across various control
settings. We validate our method through wind tunnel experiments and swimming
pool gliding tests, demonstrating that our computationally designed gliders
surpass manually designed counterparts in terms of energy efficiency. By
addressing challenges in efficient shape representation and neural fluid
surrogate models, our work paves the way for the development of highly
efficient underwater gliders, with implications for long-range ocean
exploration and environmental monitoring.

systematically examine advances and limitations of VLMs in driving tasks, we
introduce LightEMMA, a Lightweight End-to-End Multimodal Model for Autonomous

evolving state-of-the-art commercial and open-source models. We construct
twelve autonomous driving agents using various VLMs and evaluate their
performance on the nuScenes prediction task, comprehensively assessing metrics
such as inference time, computational cost, and predictive accuracy.
Illustrative examples highlight that, despite their strong scenario
interpretation capabilities, VLMs' practical performance in autonomous driving

*Keshu Wu,Zihao Li,Sixu Li,Xinyue Ye,Dominique Lord,Yang Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于AI的交互感知主动安全分析框架，通过结合自行车模型和超图AI模型，预测复杂交通环境中的车辆轨迹，并生成高保真度的安全指标（如TTC）。与传统方法相比，该框架在高速公路数据集上表现出更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全分析方法通常假设车辆行为简单（如恒定速度）或忽略车辆间交互，导致在复杂交通环境中的安全性评估不准确。因此，需要一种能够捕捉多车辆交互和动态行为的框架。

Method: 框架结合自行车模型（考虑道路坡度）和超图AI模型，通过随机微分方程计算车辆间距，并利用高阶数值方法和AI推理生成概率加权的高保真TTC分布。

Result: 在高速公路数据集上，该框架生成的高保真TTC（HF-TTC）显著优于传统恒定速度TTC和非交互感知方法，能够更准确地反映复杂交通场景的安全状况。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂交通环境中的主动安全分析提供了系统化方法，提升了安全感知能力，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces an AI-enabled, interaction-aware active safety analysis
framework that accounts for groupwise vehicle interactions. Specifically, the
framework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient
considerations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a
hypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of
ambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives
vehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic
ordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety
measures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the
framework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order
Runge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted
high-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent
maneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against
traditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on
highway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for
active safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception
in complex traffic environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种集成方法，用于在动态和不确定环境中安全高效地控制移动机器人，结合多模态运动预测与模型预测控制，提高了导航效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态和不确定环境中，移动机器人需要高效且安全的导航方法，现有的动态障碍物避障方法效果有限。

Method: 采用一次性多模态运动预测和模型预测控制，结合能量神经网络实现高分辨率多步预测，并对障碍物进行无监督分组。

Result: 在多种典型仓库场景中测试，该方法优于现有动态障碍物避障方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了移动机器人在动态环境中的导航能力，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated approach for the safe and efficient control
of mobile robots in dynamic and uncertain environments. The approach consists
of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions
of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these
predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an
energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step
predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized
to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of
treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by
proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The
overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a
specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach
allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its
performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical
warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应强化学习框架，使四足机器人能够动态适应不同负载和地形，通过仿真和硬件实验验证了其优于传统控制器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MPC的方法依赖预定义的步态或轨迹生成器，限制了在非结构化环境中的适应性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一个自适应强化学习框架，包含一个基础运动策略和一个学习纠正动作的自适应策略。

Result: 在仿真和真实四足机器人实验中，该控制器在平地和复杂地形上都表现优于传统控制器，尤其在跟踪高度和速度命令方面。

Conclusion: 该自适应控制器在不依赖手动调优或步态设计的情况下，显著提升了四足机器人的稳健性和适应能力。

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots are increasingly deployed for load-carrying tasks across
diverse terrains. While Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based methods can
account for payload variations, they often depend on predefined gait schedules
or trajectory generators, limiting their adaptability in unstructured
environments. To address these limitations, we propose an Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that enables quadrupedal robots to
dynamically adapt to both varying payloads and diverse terrains. The framework
consists of a nominal policy responsible for baseline locomotion and an
adaptive policy that learns corrective actions to preserve stability and
improve command tracking under payload variations. We validate the proposed
approach through large-scale simulation experiments in Isaac Gym and real-world
hardware deployment on a Unitree Go1 quadruped. The controller was tested on
flat ground, slopes, and stairs under both static and dynamic payload changes.
Across all settings, our adaptive controller consistently outperformed the
controller in tracking body height and velocity commands, demonstrating
enhanced robustness and adaptability without requiring explicit gait design or
manual tuning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COIL是一种多任务交互规划器，通过选择三种查询类型（技能、偏好和帮助）来最小化用户在连续任务中的人为努力。在已知用户偏好时，COIL被建模为无容量设施选址问题，支持多项式时间的次优规划；在偏好不确定时，引入一步信念空间规划，保持多项式时间性能。实验表明，该方法显著减少人为工作量，同时保证任务完成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在多任务协作场景中持续适应新任务和用户偏好，同时减少用户负担，传统单任务交互学习方法已不足够，因此提出了COIL框架。

Method: COIL采用无容量设施选址问题（UFL）建模已知偏好下的规划，并通过一步信念空间规划处理偏好不确定性，利用现成近似算法实现多项式时间规划。

Result: 模拟和实际操作实验证明，COIL显著降低了人为工作量，同时保持了任务的高完成率。

Conclusion: COIL为多任务协作机器人提供了一种高效且用户友好的交互学习框架，平衡了人为努力和任务成功。

Abstract: Collaborative robots must continually adapt to novel tasks and user
preferences without overburdening the user. While prior interactive robot
learning methods aim to reduce human effort, they are typically limited to
single-task scenarios and are not well-suited for sustained, multi-task
collaboration. We propose COIL (Cost-Optimal Interactive Learning) -- a
multi-task interaction planner that minimizes human effort across a sequence of
tasks by strategically selecting among three query types (skill, preference,
and help). When user preferences are known, we formulate COIL as an
uncapacitated facility location (UFL) problem, which enables bounded-suboptimal
planning in polynomial time using off-the-shelf approximation algorithms. We
extend our formulation to handle uncertainty in user preferences by
incorporating one-step belief space planning, which uses these approximation
algorithms as subroutines to maintain polynomial-time performance. Simulated
and physical experiments on manipulation tasks show that our framework
significantly reduces the amount of work allocated to the human while
maintaining successful task completion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶（AD）车辆的街景语义理解（S3U）任务因领域偏移导致模型泛化能力差，而联邦学习（FL）虽能提升泛化性，但动态环境中部署时面临时间灾难性遗忘问题。需平衡模型泛化与适应性。

Method: 提出FedEMA框架：1）服务器端融合当前FL轮次聚合模型与历史EMA模型以保存历史拟合能力；2）车载端通过负熵正则化防止模型过拟合EMA引入的时间模式。

Result: 在Cityscapes和Camvid数据集上的实验表明，FedEMA优于现有方法，mIoU提升7.12%。理论收敛分析支持其有效性。

Conclusion: FedEMA通过双重优化策略有效解决了FL模型在动态环境中的时间遗忘问题，显著提升了语义分割性能。

Abstract: Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex
task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically
face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models
through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models
face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically
evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of
historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average
(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral
innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation
via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL
round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative
entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to
EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a
dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and
adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the
proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid
dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing
7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在对抗性效果、生成效率和真实性上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为安全关键场景仿真提供了高效工具，有助于更鲁棒地评估自动驾驶系统。

Abstract: Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating
autonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,
existing approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient
consideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion
model (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial
safety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a
graph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that
captures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational
efficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the
denoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and
adversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that
drive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally
realistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module
based on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical
plausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes
dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness
and generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a
high level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic
safety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation
of autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 由于可变形物体具有无限的自由度和部分观测性，传统的物体操控策略难以处理其复杂状态空间和高不确定性，因此需要一种新的表示学习方法。

Result: 在三种仿真环境和真实机械臂实验中，INR-DOM方法在定量和定性分析中均表现出色。

Conclusion: INR-DOM通过学习一致的状态表示并结合强化学习，有效解决了可变形物体操控中的状态表示和策略学习问题。

Abstract: We aim to solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects, particularly
elastic bands, in real-world scenarios. However, deformable object manipulation
(DOM) requires a policy that works on a large state space due to the unlimited
degree of freedom (DoF) of deformable objects. Further, their dense but partial
observations (e.g., images or point clouds) may increase the sampling
complexity and uncertainty in policy learning. To figure it out, we propose a
novel implicit neural-representation (INR) learning for elastic DOMs, called
INR-DOM. Our method learns consistent state representations associated with
partially observable elastic objects reconstructing a complete and implicit
surface represented as a signed distance function. Furthermore, we perform
exploratory representation fine-tuning through reinforcement learning (RL) that
enables RL algorithms to effectively learn exploitable representations while
efficiently obtaining a DOM policy. We perform quantitative and qualitative
analyses building three simulated environments and real-world manipulation
studies with a Franka Emika Panda arm. Videos are available at

Abstract: Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most
previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to
the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal
logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF,
Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We
identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K
specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in
five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D
space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped
navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL
satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach
is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we
show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and
robustness to out-distribution STL specifications. Code is available at

Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,
verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research
domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon
this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our
application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively
transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution
monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding
drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose
a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network
controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show
that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition
benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying
such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose
a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate
formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results
suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and
robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited
in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle
and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,
which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will
enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's
lives and reduce our impact on the environment.

Abstract: Automated parking is a critical feature of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS), where accurate trajectory prediction is essential to bridge perception
and planning modules. Despite its significance, research in this domain remains
relatively limited, with most existing studies concentrating on single-modal
trajectory prediction of vehicles. In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a
novel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians
in automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to
capture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,
incorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder
that processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a
two-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type
embedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the
distinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure
kinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently
used within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.
We evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the
Intersections Drone (inD) dataset. Our work establishes a new baseline for
heterogeneous trajectory prediction in parking scenarios, outperforming
existing methods by a considerable margin.

Abstract: Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot
interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision for robotic
control introduces challenges such as ambiguity and verbosity. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel
paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic
representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into
human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,
circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable
robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we
present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for
RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from
2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable
3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K
instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment, enabling them to
effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated
across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating
significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success
rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step
actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements. Code and
Datasets in this paper will be released soon.

Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily
affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed
globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan

TL;DR: 为了提高实时动态MRI成像的质量和加速率，本文提出了一种新颖的外围体积去除（OVR）方法，利用深度学习模型消除非心脏区域的混叠伪影，并通过物理驱动DL方法恢复高时空分辨率图像。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法无需改变采集方式即可有效减少RT电影MRI中的伪影，为实现更高加速率的同时保持诊断质量提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid
physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and
function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for
functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging
enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial
alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,
ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine
MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,
particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel
outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating
aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework.
Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using
composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which
inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL)
model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean
outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding
k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL
(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high
spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed
method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable
to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction
techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach
provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine
MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher
acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.

### [201] [Neuroevolution of Self-Attention Over Proto-Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00186)
*Rafael C. Pinto,Anderson R. Tavares*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于原型对象（proto-objects）的视觉注意力机制替代传统基于矩形图像块的方法，显著降低了表示复杂性，并减少了62%的参数和2.6倍的训练时间，同时达到或超越现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于矩形块的注意力机制在视觉强化学习任务中虽表现优异，但其表示复杂性和计算成本较高。本文希望通过利用图像分割生成的原型对象替代固定块，以更高效的方式处理高级视觉特征。

Method: 利用图像分割技术提取图像中的原型对象，每个原型对象通过紧凑特征向量表示，从而构建一个小型自注意力模块处理语义信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上达到或超越现有基于块的实现，同时减少了62%的参数和2.6倍的训练时间。

Conclusion: 基于原型对象的注意力机制能显著降低计算复杂度并提升效率，为计算机视觉任务提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Proto-objects - image regions that share common visual properties - offer a
promising alternative to traditional attention mechanisms based on
rectangular-shaped image patches in neural networks. Although previous work
demonstrated that evolving a patch-based hard-attention module alongside a
controller network could achieve state-of-the-art performance in visual
reinforcement learning tasks, our approach leverages image segmentation to work
with higher-level features. By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed
patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image
decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object
can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a
substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic
information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach
matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based
implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.

*Liu Junchi,Tang Ying,Tretiak Sergei,Duan Wenhui,Zhou Liujiang*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合图注意力网络与符号回归的新方法SA-GAT-SR，旨在提升材料科学的预测准确性同时保持物理解释性，相比传统方法加速了23倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法（如GNNs）在材料科学中虽能高效预测，但缺乏物理解释性。本文旨在解决这一问题，通过结合GNNs的预测能力和符号回归的解析能力，提供更直观的材料行为理解。

Method: 采用自适应性图注意力网络（SA-GAT）筛选关键特征（180维特征空间），并结合符号回归模块生成紧凑的解析表达式。该方法保持了O(n)的计算复杂度。

Result: SA-GAT-SR在保持预测精度的同时，显著提升了计算效率（加速23倍），并能生成具有量子力学意义的解析关系。

Conclusion: SA-GAT-SR为计算材料科学提供了新框架，兼具预测精度与物理解释性，为材料行为研究提供了有价值的物理洞察。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of
deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for
high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling
enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While
the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and
universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack
physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we
introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention
Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically
combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of
symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm
that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen
critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while
maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently
distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly
reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times
acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on
first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a
new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between
predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical
insights into material behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物统计中，预测模型的可解释性至关重要，而传统神经网络因其"黑箱"特性难以验证和信任。MI技术的进步为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 应用MI技术分析神经网络内部计算，包括验证其学习到的内部表征、可视化输入处理的计算路径，比较不同模型的学习机制。

Result: 研究表明，MI工具能有效验证神经网络的内部表征，揭示其处理不同类型输入的方式，并提供跨模型比较的方法。

Conclusion: MI技术能提升神经网络在生物统计因果推断中的可解释性和可信度，为模型验证和比较提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interpretable insights from predictive models remain critical in
bio-statistics, particularly when assessing causality, where classical
statistical and machine learning methods often provide inherent clarity. While
Neural Networks (NNs) offer powerful capabilities for modeling complex
biological data, their traditional "black-box" nature presents challenges for
validation and trust in high-stakes health applications. Recent advances in
Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aim to decipher the internal computations
learned by these networks. This work investigates the application of MI
techniques to NNs within the context of causal inference for bio-statistics.
  We demonstrate that MI tools can be leveraged to: (1) probe and validate the
internal representations learned by NNs, such as those estimating nuisance
functions in frameworks like Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (TMLE); (2)
discover and visualize the distinct computational pathways employed by the
network to process different types of inputs, potentially revealing how
confounders and treatments are handled; and (3) provide methodologies for
comparing the learned mechanisms and extracted insights across statistical,
machine learning, and NN models, fostering a deeper understanding of their
respective strengths and weaknesses for causal bio-statistical analysis.

*Raffaele Cheula,Mie Andersen*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman图核的高斯过程回归机器学习模型，用于预测过渡态能量，显著提高了反向水煤气变换反应中单原子合金催化剂吸附和过渡态能量的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过渡态能量计算方法成本高，限制了复杂材料和反应网络的计算筛选。

Method: 使用WWL-GPR模型预测过渡态能量，并通过训练数据子采样构建模型集合以获得不确定性。

Result: 与基于标度关系或非图表示ML模型相比，WWL-GPR模型将误差降低近一个数量级。

Conclusion: 结合先进ML技术与DFT和微动力学模型，为复杂反应催化剂筛选提供了稳健框架。

Abstract: Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in
computational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the
high cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density
functional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for
predicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the
Wasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to
predict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)
reaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can
significantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on
scaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further
benefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of
WWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data
and show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF)
predictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models.
Comparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that
the WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to
scaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy
predictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to
screen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work
highlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and
microkinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS,
providing a robust framework for future catalyst design.

*Harshit Kapadia,Peter Benner,Lihong Feng*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的主动学习方法来构建参数化数据驱动的降阶模型（ROM），通过贪婪地选择参数域中最关键的样本，动态增加高保真解的数量，并使用子空间距离作为主动学习的机制。该方法成功应用于两个物理模型，展示了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要重复评估高保真动力学系统解的场合，尤其是无法获得底层控制方程时，数据驱动的降阶模型更为适用。传统方法需要大量计算资源，因此需要一种更高效的主动学习方法来优化样本选择。

Method: 提出子空间距离驱动的主动学习（SDE-AL）框架，通过POD（本征正交分解）将高保真解表示为多个参数特定的线性子空间，利用子空间之间的相对距离来指导主动学习。并给出了不同维度子空间之间的距离度量方法。

Result: 该方法成功应用于两种非侵入式降阶模型（SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN和SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN），并在两个参数化物理模型中取得了积极效果。

Conclusion: SDE-AL框架提供了一种高效的数据驱动降阶模型构建方法，显著减少了所需的高保真解数量，同时保持了模型的准确性。

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to
be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in
absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model
reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning
approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by
greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter
domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of
high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The
high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific
linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and
the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to
perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance
measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with
different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The
usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)
framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive
reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven
(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.
Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,
highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Abstract: Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of
geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs
allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can
benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better
performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature
extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on
the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data
compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source
anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is
demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets
of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches
in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology
and artificial intelligence in Africa.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于NQS在复杂量子多体系统中的高计算成本，限制了其在大规模系统和多样参数空间的探索效率。

Method: 方法提出了一种新颖的课程学习框架，结合迁移学习和Pairing-Net架构，以高效稳定地探索量子多体系统的参数空间。

Result: 研究表明，该方法实现了约200倍的计算加速，并显著提升了优化稳定性。

Conclusion: 结论表明该方法不仅提高了NQS的计算效率，还为在量子多体系统中灵活整合先验物理知识提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled
high-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as
strongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains
prohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction
strengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning
has been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to
large-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on
transfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration
across a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by
interpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate
how prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum
learning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically
implement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and
empirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately
200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization
stability compared to conventional methods.

Motivation: LLM多智能体系统中的故障归因对系统调试至关重要，但目前研究不足且人工成本高，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出自动化故障归因框架，构建Who&When数据集（127个系统的故障日志），开发和评估三种自动化方法。

Result: 最佳方法在识别故障责任智能体上达到53.5%准确率，但定位故障步骤仅14.2%，部分方法甚至低于随机水平；SOTA模型（如OpenAI o1、DeepSeek R1）也未能实用。

Conclusion: 任务复杂度高，现有方法效果有限，需进一步研究；开源代码和数据集促进领域发展。

Abstract: Failure attribution in LLM multi-agent systems-identifying the agent and step
responsible for task failures-provides crucial clues for systems debugging but
remains underexplored and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose and
formulate a new research area: automated failure attribution for LLM
multi-agent systems. To support this initiative, we introduce the Who&When
dataset, comprising extensive failure logs from 127 LLM multi-agent systems
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to specific agents and decisive
error steps. Using the Who&When, we develop and evaluate three automated
failure attribution methods, summarizing their corresponding pros and cons. The
best method achieves 53.5% accuracy in identifying failure-responsible agents
but only 14.2% in pinpointing failure steps, with some methods performing below
random. Even SOTA reasoning models, such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, fail to
achieve practical usability. These results highlight the task's complexity and
the need for further research in this area. Code and dataset are available at

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning strategy for use in multi-agent foraging
systems in which the learning is centralised to a single agent and its model is
periodically disseminated among the population of non-learning agents. In a
domain where multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the common approach,
this approach aims to significantly reduce the computational and energy demands
compared to approaches such as MARL and centralised learning models. By
developing high performing foraging agents, these approaches can be translated
into real-world applications such as logistics, environmental monitoring, and
autonomous exploration. A reward function was incorporated into this approach
that promotes role development among agents, without explicit directives. This
led to the differentiation of behaviours among the agents. The implicit
encouragement of role differentiation allows for dynamic actions in which
agents can alter roles dependent on their interactions with the environment
without the need for explicit communication between agents.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在计算机科学教育中的应用效果，以及如何通过结构化干预避免学生对AI工具的过度依赖，同时提升学习效果和技能发展。

Method: 在普渡大学的四门课程中引入“AI-Lab”模块，收集831份前后调查数据，并采用混合方法分析使用模式、态度变化及学生体验。

Result: 学生对AI工具的使用频率稳定，但在调试和作业中表现出更高的舒适度和开放性，使用模式更加审慎。

Conclusion: 结构化干预能帮助学生利用生成式AI的优势而不损害核心能力，为教育者提供了将AI融入课程的实践建议。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering computer science education, yet its
effects on student learning, skill development, and perceptions remain
underexplored. Concerns about overreliance coexist with a gap in research on
structured scaffolding to guide tool use in formal courses. This study examines
the impact of a dedicated "AI-Lab" intervention -- emphasizing guided
scaffolding and mindful engagement -- on undergraduate students in Data
Structures and Algorithms, Competitive Programming, and first-year engineering
courses at Purdue University.
  Over three semesters, we integrated AI-Lab modules into four mandatory and
elective courses, yielding 831 matched pre- and post-intervention survey
responses, alongside focus group discussions. Employing a mixed-methods
approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as
well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.
  While the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming
projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and
openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage
patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting
students' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions
corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap"
between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools
into coursework, ultimately heightening students' awareness of their own skill
development.
  These findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable
students to harness GenAI's benefits without undermining essential
competencies. We offer evidence-based recommendations for educators seeking to
integrate GenAI responsibly into computing curricula and identify avenues for
future research on GenAI-supported pedagogy.

Conclusion: 本文主张需要发展更具可解释性、鲁棒性和泛化性的心理评估框架，并针对现有挑战提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-centered
tasks, assessing their psychological traits is crucial for understanding their
social impact and ensuring trustworthy AI alignment. While existing reviews
have covered some aspects of related research, several important areas have not
been systematically discussed, including detailed discussions of diverse
psychological tests, LLM-specific psychological datasets, and the applications
of LLMs with psychological traits. To address this gap, we systematically
review six key dimensions of applying psychological theories to LLMs: (1)
assessment tools; (2) LLM-specific datasets; (3) evaluation metrics
(consistency and stability); (4) empirical findings; (5) personality simulation
methods; and (6) LLM-based behavior simulation. Our analysis highlights both
the strengths and limitations of current methods. While some LLMs exhibit
reproducible personality patterns under specific prompting schemes, significant
variability remains across tasks and settings. Recognizing methodological
challenges such as mismatches between psychological tools and LLMs'
capabilities, as well as inconsistencies in evaluation practices, this study
aims to propose future directions for developing more interpretable, robust,
and generalizable psychological assessment frameworks for LLMs.

Abstract: Given that data-dependent algorithmic systems have become impactful in more
domains of life, the need for individuals to promote their own interests and
hold algorithms accountable has grown. To have meaningful influence,
individuals must band together to engage in collective action. Groups that
engage in such algorithmic collective action are likely to vary in size,
membership characteristics, and crucially, objectives. In this work, we
introduce a first of a kind framework for studying collective action with two
or more collectives that strategically behave to manipulate data-driven
systems. With more than one collective acting on a system, unexpected
interactions may occur. We use this framework to conduct experiments with
language model-based classifiers and recommender systems where two collectives
each attempt to achieve their own individual objectives. We examine how
differing objectives, strategies, sizes, and homogeneity can impact a
collective's efficacy. We find that the unintentional interactions between
collectives can be quite significant; a collective acting in isolation may be
able to achieve their objective (e.g., improve classification outcomes for
themselves or promote a particular item), but when a second collective acts
simultaneously, the efficacy of the first group drops by as much as $75\%$. We
find that, in the recommender system context, neither fully heterogeneous nor
fully homogeneous collectives stand out as most efficacious and that
heterogeneity's impact is secondary compared to collective size. Our results
signal the need for more transparency in both the underlying algorithmic models
and the different behaviors individuals or collectives may take on these
systems. This approach also allows collectives to hold algorithmic system
developers accountable and provides a framework for people to actively use
their own data to promote their own interests.
