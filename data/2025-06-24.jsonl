Our approach is better\nthan other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep\nunderstanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better\nresults across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to\nOBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification\nof patterns in student learning experiences.

However, current\nfine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to\nreproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action\nSemantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning\nobjective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,\ninspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for\nApp agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.\nWith this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a\nsemantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the\nsemantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To\nsupport the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior\nrobustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax\nlearning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App\noperation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and\ngeneralisation of App agents over existing methods."}

CF-VLM introduces three\ncomplementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal\nalignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene\nrepresentations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's\nsensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and\nstate-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization\nbenchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,\nindicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust\nfoundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring\nreliable reasoning and interpretability."}

During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be\nnegatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,\nwe propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only\nenhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also\nmitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the\ntriplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of\nLLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge\nin a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we\nselect queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to\ndetermine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters\nin the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the\nLLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

Creating a single platform for\nstandardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of\nbalancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of\nvarious disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully\nenable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly\nmultidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge\nwith sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven\nprogress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy\n(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform\nthat balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data\nacross multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows\nusing customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI\nresearch copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and\nresearch automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools\nof Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate\nscientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research\ncommunity-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole."}

Although deep learning-based methods have\nachieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in\nlong-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates\nthat large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series\nforecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have\nshortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt\nformulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual\nprompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based\ntime series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and\ncross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified\ntextual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard\nprompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the\nforecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal\nalignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual\ninformation. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected\nto obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3\ncarbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework\nfor time series forecasting."}

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more\nrobust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn\nfrom a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data.

Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.\nOverall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL\ngrounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity."}

Paper length: 20 pages of main text + 2 pages of references\n  + 21 pages of appendices", "summary": "People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a\nrandom event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we\nespecially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be\nunderstood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear\napproximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the\nparametric space."}

The unit cost of an LLM is\nthe computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in\nthe efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the\nnumber of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular\napplications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation\nis that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the\ntokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most\nlikely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that\nimmediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing\ntokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for\ndifferent tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot\nconversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in\nthis domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers\nconsistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead\nto meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or\neven slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original\ntraining corpus."}

In this study, we summarize and categorize\nprevious works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,\nbinning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.\nThrough theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations\nin previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a\nprobabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which\ntheoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical\ncalibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective\npost-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten\nidentified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than\ntraditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our\nlearning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our\nprobabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable\nobjective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the\ncorrespondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with\nrespect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical\neffectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by\nachieving state-of-the-art performance.

To address this, we further\nenhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,\ncoupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally\ngeneralizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder\nthat harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in\nreporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our\nestablished FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and\nadaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center\ndata and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication\nefficiency."}

This paper\nintroduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework\ndesigned to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in\nMAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic\nvoting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the\nrelevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational\ncontext; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing\nimportance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different\ntime horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based\nconsensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items\nare agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in\nthe presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N\ngreater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient\ninter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage\nand similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata.

To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining.

Researchers often lack the computational\nexpertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas\nplatform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific\ndomains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven\nprogress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy\n(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform\nthat balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data\nacross multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows\nusing customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI\nresearch copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and\nresearch automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools\nof Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate\nscientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research\ncommunity-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole."}

These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that\nintegrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a\ntransformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies\nYOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)\npatches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,\nlightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D\nmechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is\ntrained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These\nare parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are\nlightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited\ncomputational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated\ndataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a\ncomparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four\nkey metrics.

In this paper, we propose Programming by\nBackprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to\nevaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without\never seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate.

Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

Existing colorization\nmethods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information\nand insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image\ndistortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery\nprovides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details\nand enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative\nadversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral\ninformation to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework\nemploys a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as\nthe generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention\ncomputation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral\nattention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and\nreducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a\nTransformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped\narchitecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale\nwavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency\ndual domain.

Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random\nselection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL\nperformance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to\nreduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve\nenergy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\\times$ faster time-to-accuracy\nand up to $1.06\\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines."}

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

These tools exist in various\nforms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems,\neach employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers\noften require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others\nallow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some\ndegree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by\nautonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without\nrequiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art\ngenerative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with\ncustom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into\nrich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential\napplications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for\nreal-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we\nbelieve it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance\nand expressive musical augmentation.

To address these challenges, we\nevaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component\ntasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of\ntask-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep\nlearning models -- an \"information saturation bottleneck\" -- where networks\nfail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during\ntraining.

We provide\ntheoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising\nspins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk\nminimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge\nin solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)\nmodel on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing\nthe penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of\npenalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,\nincreasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.\nTo address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)\nalgorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO\nproblem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with\nrandomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited\nprecision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an\nupper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental\nresults using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on\nthe Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision."}

This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,\nand Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than\n$2$ and to $\\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is\nconstrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive\nsemi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity\nassumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel\nnotion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line\ndigraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices."}

To address this, we propose Structured\nKolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates\nstructured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).\nSKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function\napproximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual\nsensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable\nquantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent\nrepresentation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of\nKAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing\ndynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the\nNeural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to\nrefine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered\nequations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive\nexperiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE\nachieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent\nmodels that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems."}

The generalization\nerror bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the\nflatness term.
