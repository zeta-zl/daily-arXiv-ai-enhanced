However, GSC relies on\nthe alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that\npossessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless\ntransmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this\npaper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm\nfor GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the\ncloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and\nused to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel\nconditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge\ndistillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD,\nan optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge\ndistillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression\nrates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment\nbetween the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%.\nMoreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the\nbaseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%."}

Materials and\nMethods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 1,000 consecutive radiology\nreports (250 each: radiography, ultrasonography, CT, MRI) from the MIMIC-III\ndatabase. Two external datasets (CheXpert and Open-i) were validation sets.\nThree LLM frameworks were tested: (1) single-prompt detector; (2) extractor\nplus detector; and (3) extractor, detector, and false-positive verifier.\nPrecision was measured by PPV and absolute true positive rate (aTPR).\nEfficiency was calculated from model inference charges and reviewer\nremuneration.

The resulting metadata\nallows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs\nwith over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses,\nand to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling.\nClinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as\nhospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an\nalternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from\nPubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP.\nPreliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated\nsubsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting\nperformance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving\nMedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster\nconvergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens,\nindicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining\nstrategies."}

In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms\nbetween off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple\noff-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with\n$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$\nemphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more\nheavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE\nalgorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,\nthe algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that\nwhile on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,\noff-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on\nnegative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled\nstochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on\nreasoning tasks."}

Moreover,\nit is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve\nbeyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\nimitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration\n(ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy\noptimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high\nuncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and\n(2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the\ndemonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art\nimitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves\nbeyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations\nthan in previous work.

An ansatz of\npsycholinguistics is that modeling a reader's fixations and saccades yields\ninsight into their online sentence processing. However, standard approaches to\nsuch modeling rely on aggregated eye-tracking measurements and models that\nimpose strong assumptions, ignoring much of the spatio-temporal dynamics that\noccur during reading. In this paper, we propose a more general probabilistic\nmodel of reading behavior, based on a marked spatio-temporal point process,\nthat captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land in\nspace and when they take place in time. The saccades are modeled using a Hawkes\nprocess, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new\nfixation occurring near it in time and space. The duration time of fixation\nevents is modeled as a function of fixation-specific predictors convolved\nacross time, thus capturing spillover effects. Empirically, our Hawkes process\nmodel exhibits a better fit to human saccades than baselines. With respect to\nfixation durations, we observe that incorporating contextual surprisal as a\npredictor results in only a marginal improvement in the model's predictive\naccuracy.

In this work, we study how to robustly\nscale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,\nmulti-task setting.\n  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation\nand selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and\nvaried language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing\nthat strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages.\nWe propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for\nmultilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable\ngains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and\nselection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models\non m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At\nlarger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0\nimprovement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against\nsingle-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results\nunderscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time\ncompute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented\nlanguages."}

Existing methods\ntypically aim to find an $\\epsilon$-$expectedly\\ feasible\\ stochastic\\ optimal$\nsolution, in which the expected constraint violation and expected optimality\ngap are both within a prescribed tolerance $\\epsilon$. However, in many\npractical applications, constraints must be nearly satisfied with certainty,\nrendering such solutions potentially unsuitable due to the risk of substantial\nviolations. To address this issue, we propose stochastic first-order methods\nfor finding an $\\epsilon$-$surely\\ feasible\\ stochastic\\ optimal$\n($\\epsilon$-SFSO) solution, where the constraint violation is deterministically\nbounded by $\\epsilon$ and the expected optimality gap is at most $\\epsilon$.\nOur methods apply an accelerated stochastic gradient (ASG) scheme or a modified\nvariance-reduced ASG scheme $only\\ once$ to a sequence of quadratic penalty\nsubproblems with appropriately chosen penalty parameters. We establish\nfirst-order oracle complexity bounds for the proposed methods in computing an\n$\\epsilon$-SFSO solution. As a byproduct, we also derive first-order oracle\ncomplexity results for sample average approximation method in computing an\n$\\epsilon$-SFSO solution of the stochastic optimization problem using our\nproposed methods to solve the sample average problem."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live\nevaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with\nand leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community.\nBuilding on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at\nexchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context.\nCoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2%\nhuman competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions.

Modern\nacquisition systems have granted the possibility to acquire an escalating\namount of images, requiring a consequent development of a large collection of\ndeep learning-based automatic image analysis methods.

Under Review", "summary": "We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to\nperform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human\ndemonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.
