### [1] [RepeaTTS: Towards Feature Discovery through Repeated Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08012)
*Atli Sigurgeirsson,Simon King*

Key words: 文本到语音、提示控制、主成分分析、细调、可控性

TL;DR: 提出一种基于提示的文本到语音模型，通过自然语言指令控制语音属性，并利用不可控方差进行细调以提高可控性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决现有基于提示的文本到语音模型在控制范围和灵活性上的不足。

Method: 通过主成分分析确定潜在特征，并将其作为标签用于二次细调。

Result: 在无情感披露的模型中，方法显著提高了模型的可控性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用不可控方差，有效扩展了模型的控制能力。

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Key words: MedicalBERT, 生物医学NLP, 预训练模型, BERT, 性能优化

TL;DR: 该研究提出了MedicalBERT，一种专为生物医学文本设计的预训练BERT模型，显著提升了生物医学自然语言处理任务的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 生物医学文献的领域特定术语对通用语言模型（如BERT、GPT）提出了挑战，需要一种优化的模型来处理这些复杂任务。

Method: 研究者开发了MedicalBERT，一个基于BERT的预训练模型，通过大规模生物医学数据集训练，并优化以适应多项任务。

Result: MedicalBERT在多个基准测试中优于其他BERT变体（如BioBERT、SciBERT），平均性能比通用BERT高出5.67%。

Conclusion: 研究表明预训练的BERT模型在生物医学NLP任务中具有潜力，尤其是通过领域特定优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores
the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing
domain-specific information.

### [3] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Key words: 大语言模型、AI安全、越狱策略、复杂性分析、防御机制

TL;DR: 研究表明，越狱策略的复杂性并未显著高于普通对话，且随着时间推移，安全机制有所改善，攻击复杂性趋于稳定。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 了解越狱策略的复杂性对AI安全至关重要，挑战了攻击与防御之间的军备竞赛叙事。

Method: 对超过200万真实对话进行大规模分析，使用概率度量、词汇多样性等复杂性指标。

Result: 越狱尝试的复杂性未显著高于普通对话，且安全机制改善导致攻击毒性稳定。

Conclusion: 攻击复杂性存在天然限制，防御措施持续进步，但学术披露可能打破平衡。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

### [4] [Assessing the Capabilities and Limitations of FinGPT Model in Financial NLP Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08015)
*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Key words: FinGPT, 金融NLP, 任务评估, 语言模型性能

TL;DR: FinGPT在金融领域NLP任务中表现优异，尤其在分类任务（如情绪分析和标题分类）中媲美GPT-4，但在涉及推理和生成的任务（如金融问答和摘要）中表现较差。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 评估FinGPT在金融领域特定任务中的能力与局限性，为未来研究提供基准。

Method: 在六项金融NLP任务上测试FinGPT，使用金融领域数据集并与GPT-4及人工基准对比。

Result: FinGPT在分类任务中表现强劲，但在复杂推理和生成任务中表现不足。

Conclusion: FinGPT适用于结构化金融任务，但需进一步优化以提升综合性能。

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

### [5] [Mechanistic Indicators of Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08017)
*Pierre Beckmann,Matthieu Queloz*

Key words: 机制可解释性, 大规模语言模型, 机器理解, 认知架构

TL;DR: 本文总结了大规模语言模型（LLMs）内部机制的研究成果，提出了三层级的机器理解框架，并讨论了LLMs与人类认知的差异。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 挑战LLMs仅依赖表面统计特征的观点，探索其在内部结构上的功能性类比于人类理解的能力。

Method: 提出三层级的机器理解框架：概念理解、世界状态理解和原则性理解，并通过机制可解释性（MI）的研究支持。

Result: LLMs能形成类比于人类理解的内部结构，但其认知架构与人类不同。

Conclusion: 应转向讨论LLMs如何以其独特方式工作，而非是否具备理解能力。

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

### [6] [Review, Remask, Refine (R3): Process-Guided Block Diffusion for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08018)
*Nikita Mounier,Parsa Idehpour*

Key words: 迭代文本生成, R3框架, Process Reward Model, 掩码策略, 预训练模型

TL;DR: 提出了一个无需额外训练的迭代文本生成框架R3（Review, Remask, Refine），通过Process Reward Model评审中间生成块，并根据评分动态调整掩码策略，优化最终输出。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决迭代文本生成中模型高效识别和纠正自身错误的关键挑战。

Method: R3框架通过三步实现：Review（评审中间生成块）、Remask（根据PRM分数动态掩码）、Refine（重点优化低分部分）。

Result: R3能够更高效地聚焦于子优部分，显著提升最终生成质量。

Conclusion: R3是一种简单而有效的框架，适用于任何预训练掩码文本扩散模型。

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

### [7] [Signal or Noise? Evaluating Large Language Models in Resume Screening Across Contextual Variations and Human Expert Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08019)
*Aryan Varshney,Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula*

Key words: 大型语言模型,简历筛选,人类专家,自动化招聘

TL;DR: 研究比较了大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类专家在简历筛选中的表现，发现LLMs的行为具有一致性但与人评估显著不同。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在简历筛选中是表现出一致性还是随机性，并与人类专家进行比较。

Method: 使用Claude、GPT和Gemini三种LLMs，在四种上下文条件下测试，并与三名人类专家对比。

Result: LLMs在部分条件下表现显著差异，且与人类评估显著不同；GPT对公司上下文适应性最强。

Conclusion: LLMs在详细提示下表现出可解释的模式，但与人类判断有显著差异。

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

### [8] [Circumventing Safety Alignment in Large Language Models Through Embedding Space Toxicity Attenuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08020)
*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Key words: 大型语言模型、嵌入空间中毒、安全对齐、对抗扰动、ETTA

TL;DR: 本文提出ETTA框架，通过线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中的毒性敏感维度，以绕过模型的拒绝行为，同时保持语言连贯性。实验证明其攻击成功率高，突显了当前对齐策略的脆弱性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多个领域取得了成功，但嵌入空间中毒威胁其安全性，现有研究对此理解不足，亟需针对性更强的对抗扰动技术。

Method: 提出ETTA框架，利用线性变换识别并减弱嵌入空间中与毒性相关的维度，无需微调模型或访问训练数据。

Result: 在五个开源LLM上测试，ETTA平均攻击成功率达88.61%，优于基线11.34%，并在安全增强模型上表现良好（77.39% ASR）。

Conclusion: 当前对齐策略存在漏洞，需要开发针对嵌入空间的安全防御机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

*Li Li,Yongliang Wu,Jingze Zhu,Jiawei Peng,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Key words: 多模态上下文学习, 大型多模态模型, 图像字幕, 注意力特性, 模型优化

TL;DR: 该论文通过外部和内部研究探讨了多模态上下文学习（ICL）在图像字幕任务中的应用，分析演示配置策略及模型注意力特性，提出新指标并探索模型加速和压缩的可行性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 受大型语言模型（LLMs）成功的启发，研究者开发了具有上下文学习能力的大型多模态模型（LMMs），但对多模态ICL的演示配置研究仍处于初步阶段，且缺乏对模型行为可控性的深入分析。

Method: 通过外部实验探索演示配置策略（如镜头数、图像检索和字幕分配），并结合内部注意力特性分析；还提出基于注意力的指标并进行辅助实验以探索模型优化。

Result: 研究揭示了演示配置策略对模型性能的影响，并量化了典型注意力模式；同时，比较了模型设计的差异对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解多模态ICL提供了双重视角，提出的方法和指标可广泛应用于其他大型模型研究。

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

### [10] ["Amazing, They All Lean Left" -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027)
*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Key words: 大语言模型, 政治倾向, 道德基础, 自由价值观, 训练数据

TL;DR: 研究揭示多数商用大语言模型（LLM）在伦理和政治响应中表现出自由倾向，可能与训练数据、RLHF、学术伦理讨论及安全调整实践相关。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探究LLMs政治倾向的原因及影响。

Method: 使用道德基础理论、政治意识形态量表和争议指数分析7种主流LLMs。

Result: 发现模型普遍偏向自由价值观，与训练和调整过程有关。

Conclusion: 自由倾向非编程错误，而是民主权利话语训练的体现，可能反映集体推理。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

TL;DR: AI辅助招聘显著提升候选人通过率和就业率，但偏向年轻、经验少的申请者。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 量化AI在招聘中对效率和候选人选择的影响。

Method: 随机分配37,000名申请者至传统或AI辅助招聘流程，对比结果。

Result: AI组通过率提高20个百分点，就业率提高5.9个百分点。

Conclusion: AI提升效率，但需注意选择偏向。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

### [12] [A Systematic Analysis of Declining Medical Safety Messaging in Generative AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08030)
*Sonali Sharma,Ahmed M. Alaa,Roxana Daneshjou*

Key words: 生成式AI, 免责声明, 医疗图像, 大型语言模型, 视觉语言模型

TL;DR: 该研究分析了2022年至2025年生成式AI模型（LLMs和VLMs）在医疗图像和问题回答中免责声明的出现情况，发现免责声明的比例显著下降，强调了在临床环境中实施免责声明的必要性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 随着生成式AI模型在医疗领域的应用增加，其输出中的不准确性需要免责声明作为安全措施，但免责声明的使用情况随时间变化未被充分研究。

Method: 研究人员使用500张乳腺X光片、500张胸部X光片、500张皮肤病图像和500个医学问题，筛查了2022年至2025年LLM和VLM输出中的免责声明短语。

Result: 免责声明在LLM和VLM输出中的比例从2022年的26.3%和2023年的19.6%分别降至2025年的0.97%和1.05%。到2025年，大多数模型不再显示免责声明。

Conclusion: 随着模型能力提升，需要在临床环境中动态调整免责声明的使用，以确保安全性。

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨SLMs作为隐私保护工具在敏感应用中的潜力，特别是与LLMs相比在心理健康理解任务中的表现差异。

Method: 通过零样本和小样本学习范式，评估五种SLMs和三种LLMs在六项心理健康任务上的表现。

Result: SLMs在二分类任务中与LLMs性能接近（F1分数0.64 vs 0.66），多分类任务中均表现下降30%。小样本学习显著提升SLMs性能（最高14.6%）。

Conclusion: SLMs在心理健康理解任务中表现出色，适合作为隐私保护的规模化筛查工具。

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

Conclusion: 框架的成功为构建复杂计算生态系统以支持多样化任务铺平了道路。

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨MedVQA在放射学工作流程中的实际应用及其整合的障碍，以提升其临床实用性。

Method: 采用Arksey和O'Malley的范围综述框架，结合文献综述和对临床医生调查的双管齐下方法。

Result: 发现60%的问答对无临床意义，且现有系统缺乏多视角、电子健康记录整合等功能，临床医生认为其实用性较低。

Conclusion: MedVQA潜力巨大，但需解决多模态分析不足、缺乏患者背景等问题以实现有效临床整合。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

TL;DR: CRISP是一种用于提高LLM推理能力的数据集和方法，通过自动生成和验证高优先级计划，微调小模型在数学推理和代码生成任务上表现优于大型模型的少量提示和链式思维推理。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）在解决复杂问题时的推理能力仍有不足，链式思维（CoT）推理虽然有所改进，但仍不能满足需求。现有方法假设LLM可以通过少量提示生成有效的高优先级计划，但这种假设可能不成立。

Method: 引入CRISP数据集，用于数学推理和代码生成任务的高优先级计划生成。计划通过自动生成并经过内在（LLM作为评判者）和外在（下游任务性能）的严格验证。通过在小模型上微调CRISP数据，使其生成更高质量的计划。

Result: 微调CRISP的小模型在生成高优先级计划的质量上优于大型模型的少量提示方法，且显著优于链式思维推理。跨领域的评估显示，微调在一个领域的能力可以泛化到另一个领域。

Conclusion: CRISP展示了高优先级计划生成方法的潜力，能显著提升LLM的推理能力，并具有跨领域的泛化性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

Motivation: 支持或自动化研究过程中的部分工作，尤其是在实证AI研究中设计消融实验的需求。

Method: 引入AblationBench基准套件，包含AuthorAblation和ReviewerAblation两个任务，使用基于LM的评判者作为自动评估框架。

Result: 前沿LM系统在任务中表现仍具挑战性，最佳系统平均仅识别出29%的原始消融实验。

Conclusion: 现有LM在消融实验规划任务中存在局限性，链式思考提示优于现有的基于代理的方法。

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 现有方法在多轮对话中采用固定的 KV 缓存压缩策略，忽略了对话间注意力模式的差异，导致准确性下降，亟需一种动态优化的解决方案。

Method: Krul 通过预压缩策略选择器、令牌级异构注意力相似性估计器和无气泡恢复调度器，动态调整 KV 缓存恢复策略。

Result: 实验表明，Krul 将首词时间（TTFT）缩短了 1.5x-2.68x，KV 缓存存储减少了 1.33x-2.35x，且不损失生成质量。

Conclusion: Krul 通过动态优化 KV 缓存恢复策略，显著提升了多轮对话中 LLM 的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

Motivation: 解决在知识图谱上从自然语言生成SPARQL查询的问题，无需依赖大量标注数据进行微调，降低实现成本。

Method: 利用大型语言模型直接探索知识图谱，通过策略性执行SPARQL查询搜索相关IRI和字面量。评估了不同规模的知识图谱和语言模型。

Result: 在Wikidata上实现零射击状态下的最优结果，在Freebase上接近少样本方法的表现，其他知识图谱上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法在零射击或少样本情况下表现优异，适用于多种知识图谱和语言模型。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种透明、可审计的方法来利用语言模型，适用于多种决策工作流程。

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）长上下文中KV缓存内存需求高的问题，降低资源消耗和服务成本。

Method: 使用近似杠杆分数确定token重要性，提出context-calibrated压缩方法推断最大压缩比。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，Compactor性能与竞争方法相当，内存需求减少63%。

Conclusion: Compactor高效减少KV缓存内存，适用于多种任务和模型，通用性强。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

Conclusion: 通过两阶段微调和针对性提示，可以有效将LLM的共情能力蒸馏到SLM中，显著提升SLM的性能。

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 探讨为什么微调后的LLMs能表现出出乎意料的分布外泛化能力（OOCR），并解释其背后的机制。

Method: 通过LoRA微调分析OOCR现象，发现其依赖于添加恒定转向向量，并验证了直接训练转向向量也能实现OOCR。

Result: 恒定转向向量能显著提升任务性能并实现广泛的泛化，甚至在需要条件行为的任务（如模型后门）中也适用。

Conclusion: OOCR现象可以通过恒定转向向量解释，为LLMs的安全可靠部署提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Result: 强模型普遍优于真实学生，模型与年级匹配需特定提示且效果不一。

Conclusion: 需新训练和评估策略，为代理选择提供指南。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

Motivation: 解决在推理密集型任务中模型过度思考的问题，通过自动思维训练范式动态调整推理模式。

Method: 1.构建双模态数据集；2.使用多令牌预测增强知识蒸馏；3.冷启动初始化策略；4.提出Step-SRPO强化学习算法。

Result: KAT在多基准中表现优异，token使用减少30%，并在实际应用中提升开发效率。

Conclusion: KAT通过动态推理模式显著提升性能与效率，并展示了AutoThink范式的可扩展性。

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在跨模态和跨语言的文档图像机器翻译任务中表现不佳，同时避免遗忘其原有OCR能力的问题。

Method: 引入SSR（同步自我审查）微调范式，通过要求模型先生成OCR文本再翻译，利用其单语言OCR能力辅助跨语言翻译学习。

Result: 实验表明SSR能有效减轻灾难性遗忘，提升模型在OCR和文档图像机器翻译任务中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSR方法通过结合OCR能力与翻译任务，成功提升了多模态大语言模型在复杂文档处理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

*Yinzhu Quan,Xinrui Li,Ying Chen*

Key words: CRM, 多代理系统, 大型语言模型, 群体学习, 检索与适配

TL;DR: CRMAgent是一种基于大型语言模型的多代理系统，通过三种模式帮助商家生成高质量的信息模板和写作指南，提升CRM效果。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 商家在私人渠道中缺乏撰写有说服力消息的专业知识和工具，导致CRM效果不佳。

Method: CRMAgent采用群体学习、检索与适配及基于规则的备用模式，优化消息模板。

Result: 实验表明，CRMAgent在受众匹配和营销效果指标上显著优于商家原有模板。

Conclusion: CRMAgent有效解决了商家在CRM消息撰写中的挑战，提升了营销成效。

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 目标是利用现有专利快速生成具有商业可行性的产品创意，推动专利的商业化应用。

Method: 采用Gemini 2.5和GPT-4.1的结合，通过迭代编辑提示词生成创意，并由Qwen3-8B通过Elo循环选出最佳提示词。

Result: 在三个领域的36次测试中赢得25次，表现优异，但在材料化学领域稍显不足。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程能够有效生成竞争性强的商业创意，但某些领域需要更深入的领域知识补充。

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

Key words: 文本重新排名、对比学习、知识蒸馏、信息检索、跨编码器

TL;DR: 本文通过实验比较了两种训练文本重新排名器的方法：对比学习和知识蒸馏，发现当从更大的教师模型蒸馏时，知识蒸馏表现更优。

<details>

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 研究对比学习和知识蒸馏在训练跨编码器重新排名器中的实际效果，明确其优劣。

Method: 在相同数据上训练不同大小和架构的重新排名器，分别采用对比学习和知识蒸馏，并使用强大的对比学习模型作为蒸馏教师。

Result: 知识蒸馏在从更大的教师模型蒸馏时表现优于对比学习，但在教师模型与学生模型容量相同时无明显优势。

Conclusion: 建议在有大容量教师模型时采用知识蒸馏训练小型重新排名器，否则使用对比学习作为可靠替代方案。

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 目前缺乏系统研究探讨如何在金融领域充分释放LLMs和RLLMs的性能潜力。

Method: 使用五种LLMs和三种RLLMs，评估了提示方法、代理框架和多语言对齐方法对金融问答任务的影响。

Result: 1. 当前提示方法和代理框架通过模拟长链思维（Long CoT）提升LLMs性能；2. RLLMs自带Long CoT能力，传统方法对其提升有限；3. 多语言对齐方法通过扩展推理长度提升LLMs的多语言表现，对RLLMs效果甚微。

Conclusion: 研究为金融问答领域的LLMs和RLLMs提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

Main category: cs.CL

Motivation: 当前n-gram指标（如ROUGE）在英语生成任务中被广泛使用，但其在其他语言中的适用性尚不明确。本文旨在系统性评估这些指标的多语言有效性。

Method: 设计大规模评估套件，覆盖八种语言（来自四种语言类型），分析不同指标与人工评估的相关性。

Result: n-gram指标在屈折语言中表现不佳，但在形态丰富的语言中，适当的分词可改善效果。神经基指标（如COMET）在低资源语言中表现优越。

Conclusion: n-gram指标在屈折语言中存在局限性，建议加大对神经基评估指标的投入。

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Motivation: 解决语言模型生成不准确内容的问题，探索如何通过微调减少幻觉。

Method: 比较微调真实数据和模型生成数据的效果，评估不同过滤策略对长文本生成任务的影响。

Result: 微调通过模型自我判断过滤的生成数据，比直接使用真实数据更能提高内容的准确性。

Conclusion: 模型自身对数据的判断是提升准确性的强有力信号。

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

LLMs in discipline-specific contexts. From the perspective of their
applicability, this paper explores how LLMs are contributing to various
disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and the
humanities and social sciences, demonstrating their role in discipline-specific
tasks. The prevailing challenges are critically examined and the promising
research directions are highlighted alongside the recent advances in LLMs. By

Result: 实验显示逻辑泛化性能提升超过30%，同时保持编辑的可靠性和特异性。

Conclusion: ChainEdit在知识编辑后保持了内部逻辑一致性，并在连锁效应方面取得新突破。

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

Result: LLM能可靠检测动态辩论中的共识，引入共识检测代理可提升讨论效率和决策质量。

Conclusion: LLM多智能体系统可有效模拟群体决策过程，支持跨领域专家研讨。

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Motivation: 税收咨询实践中，客户常以自然语言描述案例，LLMs有望支持自动化决策，减轻专业人员负担。但其在法律领域的潜在幻觉行为是一大挑战。

Method: 实验采用微调和RAG两种方法，分别应用于教科书案例和实际税收咨询案例，系统评估LLMs的法律推理能力及最佳配置。

Result: 研究发现，适当配置的LLMs可有效支持增值税任务并提供法律依据，但目前原型尚无法完全自动化，需进一步整合结构化背景信息。

Conclusion: LLMs在税收咨询中具有潜力，但需改进以应对隐式客户知识和特定上下文文档处理。

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

combination with an Iterative Pseudo Labeling strategy, effectively enhancing
the theoretical upper bound of model performance. Based on Whisper-large-v3 and
Qwen2-Audio, we conduct systematic experiments using a three-stage training
process: Focus Training, Feed Back Training, and Fix Training. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, the
MegaAIS research team applied this technique in the Interspeech 2025
Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Modeling Challenge (MLC-SLM),
achieving 4th in Track 1 (Multilingual ASR Task) and 1st place in Track 2
(Speech Separation and Recognition Task), showcasing the practical feasibility
and strong application potential of our approach.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Result: 在ActPlan-1K和ALFRED基准测试中，LLaPa生成的规划质量更高，显著优于先进模型。

Conclusion: LLaPa通过多模态输入和反事实推理的整合，显著提升了程序规划的质量和准确性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in
counterfactual scenarios. Extensive experiments on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED
benchmarks demonstrate that LLaPa generates higher-quality plans with superior
LCS and correctness, outperforming advanced models. The code and models are

Result: LLM初始化对收敛无帮助，后期校正提高了5.86%的一致性。

Conclusion: LLM在主题模型中的辅助作用有潜力，但并非总是最优选择。

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

Conclusion: LLM在论点挖掘中具有潜力，但需改进现有提示算法并优化数据集。

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

Conclusion: ASR生成的转录数据在说话者归属任务中表现良好，甚至优于人工转录数据。

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

Motivation: 解决现代大语言模型在将非正式数学形式化为机器可验证定理时面临的语料库数量和质量不足的问题。

Method: KELPS框架通过翻译、合成和过滤非正式数据，将其转化为多种形式化语言（如Lean、Coq和Isabelle），并使用新设计的Knowledge Equations（KEs）作为中间表示。

Result: 在MiniF2F数据集上实现了88.9%的句法准确性（pass@1），超过现有SOTA模型（如Deepseek-V3和Herald）的表现；生成了包含60,000多个问题的平行语料库。

Conclusion: KELPS框架通过神经符号方法显著提升了非正式数学形式化的准确性和效率，解决了语料库限制问题。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

Method: 设计了包含外向和内聚路径的KGA模块，动态融合外部知识并过滤无关信号。

Result: 在五个基准测试中验证了KGA的优异知识融合性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为静态知识融合提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Conclusion: cache steering是一种更强大、实用的可控生成方法，优于需要持续干预的现有技术。

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

Result: 实验表明该方法在保护隐私的同时，能有效诊断不同结构、类别和分布的呼吸疾病数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境下呼吸疾病诊断提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The labor-intensive nature of medical data annotation presents a significant
challenge for respiratory disease diagnosis, resulting in a scarcity of
high-quality labeled datasets in resource-constrained settings. Moreover,
patient privacy concerns complicate the direct sharing of local medical data
across institutions, and existing centralized data-driven approaches, which
rely on amounts of available data, often compromise data privacy. This study
proposes a federated few-shot learning framework with privacy-preserving
mechanisms to address the issues of limited labeled data and privacy protection
in diagnosing respiratory diseases. In particular, a meta-stochastic gradient
descent algorithm is proposed to mitigate the overfitting problem that arises
from insufficient data when employing traditional gradient descent methods for
neural network training. Furthermore, to ensure data privacy against gradient
leakage, differential privacy noise from a standard Gaussian distribution is
integrated into the gradients during the training of private models with local
data, thereby preventing the reconstruction of medical images. Given the
impracticality of centralizing respiratory disease data dispersed across
various medical institutions, a weighted average algorithm is employed to
aggregate local diagnostic models from different clients, enhancing the
adaptability of a model across diverse scenarios. Experimental results show
that the proposed method yields compelling results with the implementation of
differential privacy, while effectively diagnosing respiratory diseases using
data from different structures, categories, and distributions.

Abstract: Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools
have been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem
setups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as
multi-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the
practical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box
combinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,
chemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet
very important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial
optimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the
categorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a
distance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for
the newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These
modifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect
to the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic
problems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with
fewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,
an open-source framework for HPO.

### [57] [Quantile Reward Policy Optimization: Alignment with Pointwise Regression and Exact Partition Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08068)
*Simon Matrenok,Skander Moalla,Caglar Gulcehre*

Key words: QRPO, absolute rewards, KL-regularized RL, DPO, REBEL

TL;DR: QRPO是一种新方法，能够利用点级别的绝对奖励进行模型优化，同时保持类似DPO的简单性和离线适用性。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 目前的大语言模型优化方法如PPO和GRPO需要在线、策略算法，而DPO和REBEL等方法仅限于偏好对或相对信号。QRPO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: QRPO通过分位数奖励回归KL正则化强化学习目标的闭式解，利用可分析处理的配分函数，避免了相对信号的需求。

Result: QRPO在聊天和编码评估中表现优异，尤其在奖励模型分数、AlpacaEval 2和LeetCode上优于DPO、REBEL和SimPO。

Conclusion: QRPO能够有效利用绝对奖励而不引入长度偏差，为模型优化提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with pointwise absolute rewards has so far
required online, on-policy algorithms such as PPO and GRPO. In contrast,
simpler methods that can leverage offline or off-policy data, such as DPO and
REBEL, are limited to learning from preference pairs or relative signals. To
bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}
(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the
simplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile
rewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized
RL objective. This reward yields an analytically tractable partition function,
removing the need for relative signals to cancel this term. Moreover, QRPO
scales with increased compute to estimate quantile rewards, opening a new
dimension for pre-computation scaling. Empirically, QRPO consistently achieves
top performance on chat and coding evaluations -- reward model scores,
AlpacaEval 2, and LeetCode -- compared to DPO, REBEL, and SimPO across diverse
datasets and 8B-scale models. Finally, we find that training with robust
rewards instead of converting them to preferences induces less length bias.

TL;DR: MoFaSGD是一种内存高效的大模型微调方法，通过动态更新的低秩SVD表示近似全秩动量，减少内存使用，同时保持性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决大模型微调中因状态优化器（如AdamW）导致的高内存需求问题，现有方法如LoRA和GaLore在固定子空间或计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 提出Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD)，动态更新一阶动量的低秩SVD表示，支持高效谱归一化更新。

Result: 在大型语言模型对齐基准测试中表现优异，内存减少与LoRA相当，性能接近最先进的低秩优化方法。

Conclusion: MoFaSGD通过动态低秩因子化在内存和性能间取得平衡，为大规模模型微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large foundation models presents significant memory challenges
due to stateful optimizers like AdamW, often requiring several times more GPU
memory than inference. While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent
approaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and
subspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed
subspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring
full-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which
maintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order
momentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.
This factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that
adaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration. Crucially,
MoFaSGD leverages the computed low-rank momentum factors to perform efficient
spectrally normalized updates, offering an alternative to subspace moment
accumulation. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,
proving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization
under standard assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate MoFaSGD's effectiveness
on large language model alignment benchmarks, achieving a competitive trade-off
between memory reduction (comparable to LoRA) and performance compared to
state-of-the-art low-rank optimization methods. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/pmahdavi/MoFaSGD.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 标准优化器（如Adam）在PINNs中难以平衡损失项，尤其是在僵化或病态系统中。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了一种PDE感知的优化器。

Method: 提出的PDE感知优化器根据PDE残差梯度的方差自适应调整参数更新，避免了二阶优化器的高计算成本。在1D Burgers、Allen-Cahn和KdV方程上进行了实验。

Result: 实验表明，PDE感知优化器在收敛速度和绝对误差方面优于Adam和SOAP，尤其是在梯度变化剧烈的区域。

Conclusion: PDE残差感知的自适应性显著提升了PINNs训练的稳定性，但未来仍需研究其在更大规模和硬件加速器上的扩展。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework
for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical
constraints into the loss function. However, standard optimizers such as Adam
often struggle to balance competing loss terms, particularly in stiff or
ill-conditioned systems. In this work, we propose a PDE-aware optimizer that
adapts parameter updates based on the variance of per-sample PDE residual
gradients. This method addresses gradient misalignment without incurring the
heavy computational costs of second-order optimizers such as SOAP. We benchmark
the PDE-aware optimizer against Adam and SOAP on 1D Burgers', Allen-Cahn and
Korteweg-de Vries(KdV) equations. Across both PDEs, the PDE-aware optimizer
achieves smoother convergence and lower absolute errors, particularly in
regions with sharp gradients. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PDE
residual-aware adaptivity in enhancing stability in PINNs training. While
promising, further scaling on larger architectures and hardware accelerators
remains an important direction for future research.

Conclusion: QRPINNs在高维PDEs中表现出色，结合自适应采样可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks have shown promise in solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical constraints into neural
network training, but their performance is sensitive to the sampling of points.
Based on the impressive performance of quasi Monte-Carlo methods in high
dimensional problems, this paper proposes Quasi-Random Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (QRPINNs), which use low-discrepancy sequences for sampling instead of
random points directly from the domain. Theoretically, QRPINNs have been proven
to have a better convergence rate than PINNs. Empirically, experiments
demonstrate that QRPINNs significantly outperform PINNs and some representative
adaptive sampling methods, especially in high-dimensional PDEs. Furthermore,
combining QRPINNs with adaptive sampling can further improve the performance.

Conclusion: KKT-Hardnet为复杂系统混合建模提供了一种结合领域知识与机器学习的可靠方法。

Abstract: Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not guarantee strict
constraint satisfaction. This is problematic in engineering systems where minor
violations of governing laws can significantly degrade the reliability and
consistency of model predictions. In this work, we develop KKT-Hardnet, a PINN
architecture that enforces both linear and nonlinear equality and inequality
constraints up to machine precision. It leverages a projection onto the
feasible region through solving Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a
distance minimization problem. Furthermore, we reformulate the nonlinear KKT
conditions using log-exponential transformation to construct a general sparse
system with only linear and exponential terms, thereby making the projection
differentiable. We apply KKT-Hardnet on both test problems and a real-world
chemical process simulation. Compared to multilayer perceptrons and PINNs,
KKT-Hardnet achieves higher accuracy and strict constraint satisfaction. This
approach allows the integration of domain knowledge into machine learning
towards reliable hybrid modeling of complex systems.

Conclusion: ALCo-FM在城市风险预测中具有优越性能，且代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Traffic accidents are rare, yet high-impact events that require long-context
multimodal reasoning for accurate risk forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
ALCo-FM, a unified adaptive long-context foundation model that computes a
volatility pre-score to dynamically select context windows for input data and
encodes and fuses these multimodal data via shallow cross attention. Following
a local GAT layer and a BigBird-style sparse global transformer over H3

yields superior, well-calibrated predictions. Trained on data from 15 US cities
with a class-weighted loss to counter label imbalance, and fine-tuned with
minimal data on held-out cities, ALCo-FM achieves 0.94 accuracy, 0.92 F1, and
an ECE of 0.04, outperforming more than 20 state-of-the-art baselines in
large-scale urban risk prediction. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: Machine learning has been proposed as a way to improve educational assessment
by making fine-grained predictions about student performance and learning
relationships between items. One challenge with many machine learning
approaches is incorporating new items, as these approaches rely heavily on
historical data. We develop Text-LENS by extending the LENS partial variational
auto-encoder for educational assessment to leverage item text embeddings, and
explore the impact on predictive performance and generalization to previously
unseen items. We examine performance on two datasets: Eedi, a publicly
available dataset that includes item content, and LLM-Sim, a novel dataset with
test items produced by an LLM. We find that Text-LENS matches LENS' performance
on seen items and improves upon it in a variety of conditions involving unseen
items; it effectively learns student proficiency from and makes predictions
about student performance on new items.

Conclusion: 量子机器学习结合可穿戴传感器数据提升了情绪识别的准确性和鲁棒性，为临床和辅助生活场景提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of inferring emotional states exclusively from
physiological signals, thereby presenting a privacy-preserving alternative to
conventional facial recognition techniques. We conduct a performance comparison
of classical machine learning algorithms and hybrid quantum machine learning
(QML) methods with a quantum kernel-based model. Our results indicate that the
quantum-enhanced SVM surpasses classical counterparts in classification
performance across all emotion categories, even when trained on limited
datasets. The F1 scores over all classes are over 80% with around a maximum of
36% improvement in the recall values. The integration of wearable sensor data
with quantum machine learning not only enhances accuracy and robustness but
also facilitates unobtrusive emotion recognition. This methodology holds
promise for populations with impaired communication abilities, such as
individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and veterans
with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The findings establish an early
foundation for passive emotional monitoring in clinical and assisted living

Abstract: As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially
distributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become
a critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role
in ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current
data-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face
challenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and
robustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a
causal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially
distributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect
relationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph
profiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each
offering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures
across time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as
water treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early
warning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of
black-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda
centered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal
frameworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,
adaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We
hope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting
causality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected
infrastructures.

Motivation: 传统CoT方法依赖启发式采样，无法系统探索多样有效的推理路径，限制了其潜力。

Method: CTRLS框架将CoT建模为MDP，利用分布强化学习在潜在空间中建模推理动作的不确定性。采用基于熵的正则化和ε-greedy探索策略优化推理路径。

Result: 实验表明，CTRLS在推理准确性、多样性和探索效率方面显著提升。理论分析通过ELBO为潜在推理动态建模提供支持。

Conclusion: CTRLS通过结构化的推理建模和改进的探索策略，提升了推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enables large language models (LLMs) to
break down complex problems into interpretable intermediate steps,
significantly enhancing model transparency and performance in reasoning tasks.
However, conventional CoT methods rely on heuristic sampling without structured
modeling of reasoning transitions, constraining their ability to systematically
explore and discover diverse and effective reasoning trajectories. In this
work, we introduce CTRLS, a framework that formulates CoT reasoning as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with latent state transitions, enabling principled and
state-aware exploration via distributional reinforcement learning. By modelling
reasoning actions as explicit probability distributions in latent space, our
approach explicitly models epistemic uncertainty, facilitating robust
exploration of the reasoning space. As part of our framework, we introduce an
on-policy reinforcement learning strategy incorporating epsilon-greedy
exploration and entropy-based regularization to iteratively refine latent state
transitions without requiring additional fine-tuning of the underlying LLM.
Theoretical analyses provide evidence lower bounds (ELBO), theoretically
grounding our transition-aware modeling of latent reasoning dynamics. Further
experiments demonstrate improvements in reasoning accuracy, diversity, and
exploration efficiency across benchmark reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: EvA揭示了攻击设计中的未开发潜力，为图神经网络的鲁棒性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Even a slight perturbation in the graph structure can cause a significant
drop in the accuracy of graph neural networks (GNNs). Most existing attacks
leverage gradient information to perturb edges. This relaxes the attack's
optimization problem from a discrete to a continuous space, resulting in
solutions far from optimal. It also restricts the adaptability of the attack to
non-differentiable objectives. Instead, we introduce a few simple yet effective
enhancements of an evolutionary-based algorithm to solve the discrete
optimization problem directly. Our Evolutionary Attack (EvA) works with any
black-box model and objective, eliminating the need for a differentiable proxy
loss. This allows us to design two novel attacks that reduce the effectiveness
of robustness certificates and break conformal sets. The memory complexity of
our attack is linear in the attack budget. Among our experiments, EvA shows
$\sim$11\% additional drop in accuracy on average compared to the best previous
attack, revealing significant untapped potential in designing attacks.

Abstract: Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.

Abstract: Human state detection and behavior prediction have seen significant
advancements with the rise of machine learning and multimodal sensing
technologies. However, predicting prosocial behavior intentions in mobility
scenarios, such as helping others on the road, is an underexplored area.
Current research faces a major limitation. There are no large, labeled datasets
available for prosocial behavior, and small-scale datasets make it difficult to
train deep-learning models effectively. To overcome this, we propose a
self-supervised learning approach that harnesses multi-modal data from existing
physiological and behavioral datasets. By pre-training our model on diverse
tasks and fine-tuning it with a smaller, manually labeled prosocial behavior
dataset, we significantly enhance its performance. This method addresses the
data scarcity issue, providing a more effective benchmark for prosocial
behavior prediction, and offering valuable insights for improving intelligent
vehicle systems and human-machine interaction.

Abstract: Estimating the score function (or other population-density-dependent
functions) is a fundamental component of most generative models. However, such
function estimation is computationally and statistically challenging. Can we
avoid function estimation for data generation? We propose an estimation-free
generative method: A set of points whose locations are deterministically
updated with (inverse) gradient descent can transport a uniform distribution to
arbitrary data distribution, in the mean field regime, without function
estimation, training neural networks, and even noise injection. The proposed
method is built upon recent advances in the physics of interacting particles.
We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that these advances can be
leveraged to develop novel generative methods.

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，K-Means和GMM的聚类准确率显著提升，平均ARI分别提高40%和14%。

Abstract: Density and geometry have long served as two of the fundamental guiding
principles in clustering algorithm design, with algorithm usually focusing
either on the density structure of the data (e.g., HDBSCAN and Density Peak
Clustering) or the complexity of underlying geometry (e.g., manifold clustering
algorithms).
  In this paper, we identify and formalize a recurring but often overlooked
interaction between distribution and geometry and leverage this insight to
design our clustering enhancement framework CoreSPECT (Core Space
Projection-based Enhancement of Clustering Techniques). Our framework boosts
the performance of simple algorithms like K-Means and GMM by applying them to
strategically selected regions, then extending the partial partition to a
complete partition for the dataset using a novel neighborhood graph based
multi-layer propagation procedure.
  We apply our framework on 15 datasets from three different domains and obtain
consistent and substantial gain in clustering accuracy for both K-Means and
GMM. On average, our framework improves the ARI of K-Means by 40% and of GMM by
14%, often surpassing the performance of both manifold-based and recent
density-based clustering algorithms. We further support our framework with
initial theoretical guarantees, ablation to demonstrate the usefulness of the
individual steps and with evidence of robustness to noise.

Abstract: Missing data presents a critical challenge in real-world datasets,
significantly degrading the performance of machine learning models. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
tabular data imputation, exemplified by frameworks like UnIMP, their reliance
on classical embedding methods often limits their ability to capture complex,
non-linear correlations, particularly in mixed-type data scenarios encompassing
numerical, categorical, and textual features. This paper introduces
Quantum-UnIMP, a novel framework that integrates shallow quantum circuits into
an LLM-based imputation architecture. Our core innovation lies in replacing
conventional classical input embeddings with quantum feature maps generated by
an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit. This approach enables the
model to leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement,
thereby learning richer, more expressive representations of data and enhancing
the recovery of intricate missingness patterns. Our experiments on benchmark
mixed-type datasets demonstrate that Quantum-UnIMP reduces imputation error by
up to 15.2% for numerical features (RMSE) and improves classification accuracy
by 8.7% for categorical features (F1-Score) compared to state-of-the-art
classical and LLM-based methods. These compelling results underscore the
profound potential of quantum-enhanced representations for complex data
imputation tasks, even with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
pivotal challenge in advancing AI capabilities. While Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a
systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and
efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and
effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL
from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,
not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy
to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency
while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending
SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that
the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The
efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on
challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the
strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the
community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art
mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically
efficient. To ensure full reproducibility and empower future research, we will

Abstract: Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

Abstract: Accurate workload prediction and advanced resource reservation are
indispensably crucial for managing dynamic cloud services. Traditional neural
networks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,
high-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,
leading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization
during training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)
adjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work
proposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based
Variable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of
quantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric
learning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit
neurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern
recognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm
for networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the
structure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm
incorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during
training process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated
against seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of
heterogeneous cloud workloads. The proposed model demonstrates superior
prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by up to 93.40% and 91.27%
compared to existing deep learning and QNN-based approaches.

Conclusion: scE2TM通过整合外部知识和定量评估框架，为单细胞数据分析提供了更强的可解释性和性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to
explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. Meanwhile,
interpretability has gained prominence parallel to the rapid increase in the
complexity and performance of deep learning models. In recent years, topic
models have been widely used for interpretable single-cell embedding learning
and clustering analysis, which we refer to as single-cell embedded topic
models. However, previous studies evaluated the interpretability of the models
mainly through qualitative analysis, and these single-cell embedded topic
models suffer from the potential problem of interpretation collapse.
Furthermore, their neglect of external biological knowledge constrains
analytical performance. Here, we present scE2TM, an external knowledge-guided
single-cell embedded topic model that provides a high-quality cell embedding
and strong interpretation, contributing to comprehensive scRNA-seq data
analysis. Our comprehensive evaluation across 20 scRNA-seq datasets
demonstrates that scE2TM achieves significant clustering performance gains
compared to 7 state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we propose a new
interpretability evaluation benchmark that introduces 10 metrics to
quantitatively assess the interpretability of single-cell embedded topic
models. The results show that the interpretation provided by scE2TM performs
encouragingly in terms of diversity and consistency with the underlying
biological signals, contributing to a better revealing of the underlying
biological mechanisms.

Abstract: Efficient planning, resource management, and consistent operations often rely
on converting textual process documents into formal Business Process Model and
Notation (BPMN) models. However, this conversion process remains time-intensive
and costly. Existing approaches, whether rule-based or machine-learning-based,
still struggle with writing styles and often fail to identify parallel
structures in process descriptions.
  This paper introduces an automated pipeline for extracting BPMN models from
text, leveraging the use of machine learning and large language models. A key
contribution of this work is the introduction of a newly annotated dataset,
which significantly enhances the training process. Specifically, we augment the
PET dataset with 15 newly annotated documents containing 32 parallel gateways
for model training, a critical feature often overlooked in existing datasets.
This addition enables models to better capture parallel structures, a common
but complex aspect of process descriptions. The proposed approach demonstrates
adequate performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a promising
foundation for organizations to accelerate BPMN model creation.

Abstract: Lane changes of preceding vehicles have a great impact on the motion planning
of automated vehicles especially in complex traffic situations. Predicting them
would benefit the public in terms of safety and efficiency. While many research
efforts have been made in this direction, few concentrated on predicting
maneuvers within a set time interval compared to predicting at a set prediction
time. In addition, there exist a lack of comparisons between different
architectures to try to determine the best performing one and to assess how to
correctly choose the input for such models. In this paper the structure of an
LSTM, a CNN and a Transformer network are described and implemented to predict
the intention of human drivers to perform a lane change. We show how the data
was prepared starting from a publicly available dataset (highD), which features
were used, how the networks were designed and finally we compare the results of
the three networks with different configurations of input data. We found that
transformer networks performed better than the other networks and was less
affected by overfitting. The accuracy of the method spanned from $82.79\%$ to
$96.73\%$ for different input configurations and showed overall good
performances considering also precision and recall.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the
intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to
leverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This
review explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks
of classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We
introduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,
quantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML
approaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is
well-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,
and so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically
identified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,
quantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically
evaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The
challenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including
hardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are
discussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need
for quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic
benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical
deployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has
significant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and
sensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on
overcoming technological and methodological hurdles.

Conclusion: 两聚类测试是一个与传统两样本测试完全不同的显著性测试问题，新方法在理论和实践中均表现出色。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental research issue in statistics and machine
learning. In many modern clustering methods, we need to determine whether two
subsets of samples come from the same cluster. Since these subsets are usually
generated by certain clustering procedures, the deployment of classic
two-sample tests in this context would yield extremely smaller p-values,
leading to inflated Type-I error rate. To overcome this bias, we formally
introduce the two-cluster test issue and argue that it is a totally different
significance testing issue from conventional two-sample test. Meanwhile, we
present a new method based on the boundary points between two subsets to derive
an analytical p-value for the purpose of significance quantification.
Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that the proposed test is
able to significantly reduce the Type-I error rate, in comparison with several
classic two-sample testing methods. More importantly, the practical usage of
such two-cluster test is further verified through its applications in
tree-based interpretable clustering and significance-based hierarchical
clustering.

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) aims to integrate the
complementary strengths of offline and online RL by pre-training an agent
offline and subsequently fine-tuning it through online interactions. However,
recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during
online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution
shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In
this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online
RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value
estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase,
Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored
specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and
SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range
of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for language
modeling, rivaling auto-regressive models by training-time scaling. However,
inference-time scaling in discrete diffusion models remains relatively
under-explored. In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving
high-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided
settings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on
particle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs
sampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using
conditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process
ensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the
reward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling
methods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach
leverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this
framework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for
inference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,
particle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our
method consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on
reward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in
accuracy under varying compute budgets.

Conclusion: RTNinja为随机电报噪声分析提供了强大工具，支持大规模统计基准测试、可靠性技术评估和下一代纳米电子器件物理研究。

Abstract: Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有RAG系统在非结构化文本检索时缺乏透明性，知识图谱提供结构化语义表示以改进可解释性和事实依据。

Method: 使用基于提示的信息抽取构建领域知识图谱，通过伪段落形式将图子结构转化为自然语言，并引入扰动解释方法评估KG组件对生成答案的影响。

Result: 实验分析了系统对不同扰动方法的敏感性、图组件重要性与结构位置的关系、语义节点类型的影响，以及图度量与解释过程中组件影响力的关联。

Conclusion: KGRAG-Ex通过知识图谱和扰动解释方法显著提升了RAG系统的可解释性和事实依据，尤其是在结构化语义路径和透明推理方面。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by grounding
responses in external information, yet explainability remains a critical
challenge, particularly when retrieval relies on unstructured text. Knowledge
graphs (KGs) offer a solution by introducing structured, semantically rich
representations of entities and their relationships, enabling transparent
retrieval paths and interpretable reasoning. In this work, we present KGRAG-Ex,
a RAG system that improves both factual grounding and explainability by
leveraging a domain-specific KG constructed via prompt-based information
extraction. Given a user query, KGRAG-Ex identifies relevant entities and
semantic paths in the graph, which are then transformed into pseudo-paragraphs:
natural language representations of graph substructures that guide corpus
retrieval. To improve interpretability and support reasoning transparency, we
incorporate perturbation-based explanation methods that assess the influence of
specific KG-derived components on the generated answers. We conduct a series of
experiments to analyze the sensitivity of the system to different perturbation
methods, the relationship between graph component importance and their
structural positions, the influence of semantic node types, and how graph
metrics correspond to the influence of components within the explanations
process.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 研究如何通过减少经验损失的方差来提升多层感知器(MLP)的泛化能力。

Method: 采用Rank Set Sampling (RSS)替代传统的Simple Random Sampling (SRS)，以减少损失方差，并开发了RSS-MLP方法。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，RSS-MLP在经验指数损失和逻辑损失上的方差均小于SRS，性能更优。

Conclusion: RSS-MLP方法在多个基准数据集上表现出更高的有效性和合理性。

Abstract: Multilayer perceptron (MLP), one of the most fundamental neural networks, is
extensively utilized for classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we
establish a new generalization error bound, which reveals how the variance of
empirical loss influences the generalization ability of the learning model.
Inspired by this learning bound, we advocate to reduce the variance of
empirical loss to enhance the ability of MLP. As is well-known, bagging is a
popular ensemble method to realize variance reduction. However, bagging
produces the base training data sets by the Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
method, which exhibits a high degree of randomness. To handle this issue, we
introduce an ordered structure in the training data set by Rank Set Sampling
(RSS) to further reduce the variance of loss and develop a RSS-MLP method.
Theoretical results show that the variance of empirical exponential loss and
the logistic loss estimated by RSS are smaller than those estimated by SRS,
respectively. To validate the performance of RSS-MLP, we conduct comparison
experiments on twelve benchmark data sets in terms of the two convex loss
functions under two fusion methods. Extensive experimental results and analysis
illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of the propose method.

Motivation: 探究不同优化器在LLM预训练中的表现，以缩短训练时间并提升模型性能。

Method: 使用两种基础架构和单/多轮训练，结合Maximal Update Parametrization和代理模型，分别调参。

Result: Sophia训练损失最低，Lion最快，AdamW下游任务表现最好。

Conclusion: 三种优化器各有优势，选择需权衡训练速度、损失和下游性能。

Abstract: Optimizers play a decisive role in reducing pre-training times for LLMs and
achieving better-performing models. In this study, we compare three major
variants: the de-facto standard AdamW, the simpler Lion, developed through an
evolutionary search, and the second-order optimizer Sophia. For better
generalization, we train with two different base architectures and use a
single- and a multiple-epoch approach while keeping the number of tokens
constant. Using the Maximal Update Parametrization and smaller proxy models, we
tune relevant hyperparameters separately for each combination of base
architecture and optimizer. We found that while the results from all three
optimizers were in approximately the same range, Sophia exhibited the lowest
training and validation loss, Lion was fastest in terms of training GPU hours
but AdamW led to the best downstream evaluation results.

Result: 新方法提供了更直接和标准化的可解释性评估，并与人类评估结果进行了比较。

Conclusion: 论文为改进稀疏编码器评估提供了建议，提出了一种更直接的可解释性评估方法。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for
machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they
are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use.
Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for
each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they
enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This
method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and
evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered.
In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of
sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural
language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and
potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we
compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human
evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for
the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques.

Motivation: 化学反应的本质在于电子的重新分配和重组，通常表现为电子转移或电子对的迁移。这些变化在物理世界中是离散且突变的，如原子电荷状态的改变或化学键的形成和断裂。为了更好地建模这些状态转换，作者提出了SynBridge。

Method: SynBridge是一种双向基于流的生成模型，通过图到图变换器网络架构和离散流桥连接任意两个离散分布，捕获反应物和产物图中原子和化学键的离散状态变化，实现多任务反应预测。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（USPTO-50K、USPTO-MIT、Pistachio）上的实验表明，SynBridge在正向和逆向合成任务中均达到最先进性能。消融研究和噪声调度分析揭示了离散空间结构扩散对反应预测的益处。

Conclusion: SynBridge通过双向流生成模型和离散状态建模，有效捕捉了化学反应的离散特性，为反应预测提供了新方法。

Abstract: The essence of a chemical reaction lies in the redistribution and
reorganization of electrons, which is often manifested through electron
transfer or the migration of electron pairs. These changes are inherently
discrete and abrupt in the physical world, such as alterations in the charge
states of atoms or the formation and breaking of chemical bonds. To model the
transition of states, we propose SynBridge, a bidirectional flow-based
generative model to achieve multi-task reaction prediction. By leveraging a
graph-to-graph transformer network architecture and discrete flow bridges
between any two discrete distributions, SynBridge captures bidirectional
chemical transformations between graphs of reactants and products through the
bonds' and atoms' discrete states. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(USPTO-50K, USPTO-MIT, Pistachio), achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both forward and retrosynthesis tasks. Our ablation studies and noise
scheduling analysis reveal the benefits of structured diffusion over discrete
spaces for reaction prediction.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising capabilities for mobile
devices, but their deployment faces significant challenges due to computational
limitations and energy inefficiency, especially for real-time applications.
This study provides a comprehensive survey of deployment frameworks for VLMs on
mobile devices, evaluating llama.cpp, MLC-Imp, and mllm in the context of
running LLaVA-1.5 7B, MobileVLM-3B, and Imp-v1.5 3B as representative workloads
on a OnePlus 13R. Each deployment framework was evaluated on the OnePlus 13R
while running VLMs, with measurements covering CPU, GPU, and NPU utilization,
temperature, inference time, power consumption, and user experience.
Benchmarking revealed critical performance bottlenecks across frameworks: CPU
resources were consistently over-utilized during token generation, while GPU
and NPU accelerators were largely unused. When the GPU was used, primarily for
image feature extraction, it was saturated, leading to degraded device
responsiveness. The study contributes framework-level benchmarks, practical
profiling tools, and an in-depth analysis of hardware utilization bottlenecks,
highlighting the consistent overuse of CPUs and the ineffective or unstable use
of GPUs and NPUs in current deployment frameworks.

Motivation: SFL在异构环境中易受灾难性遗忘影响,导致模型遗忘先前客户的知识,需要提出解决方案。

Method: 提出SFedKD框架,采用多教师知识蒸馏和分类权重策略,并设计互补式教师选择机制以减少冗余。

Result: 实验表明SFedKD有效克服灾难性遗忘,且优于当前最优FL方法。

Conclusion: SFedKD通过细粒度权重和教师选择机制,显著提升SFL性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm which
coordinates multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model via a
central server. Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL
training framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner
across clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data
heterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.
However, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting
in heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge
learned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL
framework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called
SFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the
current round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled
Knowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign
distinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based
on the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.
Through this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training
efficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent
knowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge
distillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.
Based on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection
mechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge
space coverage while reducing communication and computational costs. Extensive
experiments show that SFedKD effectively overcomes catastrophic forgetting in
SFL and outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods.

Result: 实验证明，该方法能有效优化多样目标，适用于确定性与随机场景。

Conclusion: 方法灵活适用于实际应用，展示出多目标优化的潜力。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific
objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can
be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we
propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates
the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward
aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov
decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge
from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the
generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations,
such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both
deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with
value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its
versatility and potential for real-world applications.

Method: 提出了CircFormerMoE框架，包含剪接位点检测（SSD）和剪接位点配对（SSP）两个子任务，基于Transformer和MoE技术，直接处理基因组DNA序列。

Conclusion: CircFormerMoE为植物大规模circRNA发现提供了快速准确的计算工具，为植物功能基因组学和非编码RNA注释研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释且风险感知的预测，有助于增强自动驾驶系统的决策鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and
efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods
primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with
other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain
or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that
incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from
behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal
encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential
field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for
trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to
improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative
spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate
that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%
respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk
scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware
predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving
systems.

Motivation: 提出AbbIE旨在通过递归迭代方式提升Transformer的性能，同时动态调整计算资源，以适应不同任务复杂度的需求。

Method: AbbIE采用递归的自回归块基架构，在潜在空间中进行迭代，无需专用数据集或训练协议。训练时仅需2次迭代，即可在测试时泛化到任意迭代长度。

Result: AbbIE在零样本上下文学习任务中表现优于其他方法12%，语言困惑度提升5%，展示了其高效的计算资源动态分配能力。

Conclusion: AbbIE为Transformer性能扩展提供了新思路，能够在有限的计算资源下实现更好的任务适应性。

Abstract: We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.

Abstract: Machine learning models are commonly used for malware classification;
however, they suffer from performance degradation over time due to concept
drift. Adapting these models to changing data distributions requires frequent
updates, which rely on costly ground truth annotations. While active learning
can reduce the annotation burden, leveraging unlabeled data through
semi-supervised learning remains a relatively underexplored approach in the
context of malware detection. In this research, we introduce \texttt{ADAPT}, a
novel pseudo-labeling semi-supervised algorithm for addressing concept drift.
Our model-agnostic method can be applied to various machine learning models,
including neural networks and tree-based algorithms. We conduct extensive
experiments on five diverse malware detection datasets spanning Android,
Windows, and PDF domains. The results demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms baseline models and competitive benchmarks. This work paves the way
for more effective adaptation of machine learning models to concept drift in
malware detection.

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了监测可持续水管理实践的工具，支持干预措施和项目评估。

Abstract: Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical
water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable
irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and
drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping
secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a
key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited
data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking
and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework
to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a
region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect
essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's
Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained
approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their
field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with
Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and

Key words: 图像字幕生成, 无监督学习, 多智能体强化学习, GRPO算法, 预训练模型

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习的无监督图像字幕生成方法LoGIC，通过两种代理（说话者和听者）的协作训练，显著提升了无监督场景下的性能。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有标注数据集已用于训练大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs），难以进一步提升性能，因此需要探索无监督图像字幕生成。

Method: 设计了LoGIC游戏，采用GRPO算法训练两个代理（说话者和听者），并结合预训练VLMs和LLM实现自然语言交互。

Result: 在无监督设置下，LoGIC实现了46 BLEU分数，比基线VLM高出2分；轻量级组件版本获得31 BLEU分数，优于现有无监督方法10分。

Conclusion: LoGIC在无监督图像字幕生成中表现出色，证明了多智能体强化学习的潜力。

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法忽视了协变量偏移的不平衡性，FedAKD旨在平衡预测准确性与协作公平性。

Method: FedAKD包含客户端和服务器更新：客户端采用异步知识蒸馏策略，服务器聚合客户端模型。

Result: 实验表明FedAKD显著提升了协作公平性、预测准确性，并在高度异构数据中促进客户端参与。

Conclusion: FedAKD在理论和实验中均证明了其有效性，特别是在处理数据分布不均时的优越性。

Abstract: Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However,
existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of
heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of
this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous
Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate
prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server
updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge
distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that
while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across
clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This
suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified
samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional
knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model
fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update
the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The
server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a
theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public
datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records
(EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative
fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even
under highly heterogeneous data distributions.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在长序列上因注意力机制平方时间复杂度导致的高计算成本问题，设计更高效的线性复杂度方法。

Method: 结合内容自适应随机频谱特征、多分辨率Haar小波和可学习参数，选择性关注信息尺度，保持线性效率。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于其他注意力机制，如单GPU上训练时间减少81%，FLOPs降低73.4%，且在超长序列任务中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: WERSA显著降低计算负担且不牺牲精度，使长上下文模型更实用、经济，尤其适用于低资源硬件。

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

Motivation: 传统理论认为高容量模型容易过拟合，但实践中较少见。论文假设过拟合可能发生在数据空间的局部区域，并对此展开研究。

Method: 提出局部过拟合评分，并开发两阶段方法：先集成多个检查点，再蒸馏为单一模型以减少推理成本。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构中验证了方法的有效性，尤其在标签噪声情况下，性能和效率均优于原模型及独立集成。

Conclusion: 局部过拟合是真实存在的现象，通过知识融合与蒸馏可以提升模型性能并降低复杂度。

Abstract: Overfitting in deep neural networks occurs less frequently than expected.
This is a puzzling observation, as theory predicts that greater model capacity
should eventually lead to overfitting -- yet this is rarely seen in practice.
But what if overfitting does occur, not globally, but in specific sub-regions
of the data space? In this work, we introduce a novel score that measures the
forgetting rate of deep models on validation data, capturing what we term local
overfitting: a performance degradation confined to certain regions of the input
space. We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without
conventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent
phenomenon.
  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages
the training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten
knowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by
distilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing
performance without added inference cost.
  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and
training regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, in the
presence of label noise, our method -- Knowledge Fusion followed by Knowledge
Distillation -- outperforms both the original model and independently trained
ensembles, achieving a rare win-win scenario: reduced training and inference
complexity.

Abstract: The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.

Conclusion: SPLASH为处理次优演示的长视界和对抗性任务提供了有效的解决方案，提升了逆向强化学习的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for
learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most
approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which
is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations
are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable
robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting
a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic
agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement
learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical
demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from
suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We
empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,
and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation
experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed
methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward
learning from suboptimal demonstrations.

Motivation: PMD 虽然理论上有深入研究，但缺乏实证分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过实验揭示两种正则化技术的交互效果。

Method: 在小型强化学习环境中进行了超过500k次训练实验，分析PMD中距离约束和MDP正则器的交互作用。

Result: 实验表明，两种正则化技术可以部分替代，但精确的组合对实现稳健性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在强化学习中开发更稳健算法的重要性，特别是针对超参数敏感性的改进。

Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in
reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a
first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD
incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that
enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer
that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While
PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain
scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay
between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds
on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two
regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is
critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the
potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly
with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.

<details>

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 在部署预测模型时，测试数据的偏移是一个普遍挑战。TTA方法通过持续适应未标记的测试数据来延长模型寿命，但最终仍可能失效。需要一种方法来检测这种失效点。

Method: 扩展现有的基于序贯测试的监测工具，结合置信序列，适应模型在测试时更新且无测试标签可用的情况。

Result: 提出的TTA监测框架在多种数据集、分布偏移类型和TTA方法中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 结合TTA和风险监测框架可以有效地监控模型性能，并在性能违反预设标准时发出警报。

Abstract: Encountering shifted data at test time is a ubiquitous challenge when
deploying predictive models. Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods address this
issue by continuously adapting a deployed model using only unlabeled test data.
While TTA can extend the model's lifespan, it is only a temporary solution.
Eventually the model might degrade to the point that it must be taken offline
and retrained. To detect such points of ultimate failure, we propose pairing
TTA with risk monitoring frameworks that track predictive performance and raise
alerts when predefined performance criteria are violated. Specifically, we
extend existing monitoring tools based on sequential testing with confidence
sequences to accommodate scenarios in which the model is updated at test time
and no test labels are available to estimate the performance metrics of
interest. Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk
monitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA
monitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution
shift types, and TTA methods.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在缓解灾难性遗忘与保持新任务性能之间取得了优于其他方法的平衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种新的正则化视角，通过监测训练末期的参数活动，为缓解灾难性遗忘提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting in deep neural networks occurs when learning new
tasks degrades performance on previously learned tasks due to knowledge
overwriting. Among the approaches to mitigate this issue, regularization
techniques aim to identify and constrain "important" parameters to preserve
previous knowledge. In the highly nonconvex optimization landscape of deep
learning, we propose a novel perspective: tracking parameters during the final
training plateau is more effective than monitoring them throughout the entire
training process. We argue that parameters that exhibit higher activity
(movement and variability) during this plateau reveal directions in the loss
landscape that are relatively flat, making them suitable for adaptation to new
tasks while preserving knowledge from previous ones. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance in
balancing catastrophic forgetting mitigation with strong performance on newly
learned tasks.

Conclusion: 自适应NVAR模型通过数据驱动非线性学习，提升了预测能力，简化了超参数调优。

Abstract: Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.

Abstract: We introduce the Partitioned Hybrid Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (PHQFNO),
a generalization of the Quantum Fourier Neural Operator (QFNO) for scientific
machine learning. PHQFNO partitions the Fourier operator computation across
classical and quantum resources, enabling tunable quantum-classical
hybridization and distributed execution across quantum and classical devices.
The method extends QFNOs to higher dimensions and incorporates a
message-passing framework to distribute data across different partitions. Input
data are encoded into quantum states using unary encoding, and quantum circuit
parameters are optimized using a variational scheme. We implement PHQFNO using
PennyLane with PyTorch integration and evaluate it on Burgers' equation,
incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We show that PHQFNO
recovers classical FNO accuracy. On incompressible Navier-Stokes, PHQFNO
achieves higher accuracy than its classical counterparts. Finally, we perform a
sensitivity analysis under input noise, confirming improved stability of PHQFNO
over classical baselines.

Abstract: A discrete-time conditional Gaussian Koopman network (CGKN) is developed in
this work to learn surrogate models that can perform efficient state forecast
and data assimilation (DA) for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems,
e.g., systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
Focusing on nonlinear partially observed systems that are common in many
engineering and earth science applications, this work exploits Koopman
embedding to discover a proper latent representation of the unobserved system
states, such that the dynamics of the latent states are conditional linear,
i.e., linear with the given observed system states. The modeled system of the
observed and latent states then becomes a conditional Gaussian system, for
which the posterior distribution of the latent states is Gaussian and can be
efficiently evaluated via analytical formulae. The analytical formulae of DA
facilitate the incorporation of DA performance into the learning process of the
modeled system, which leads to a framework that unifies scientific machine
learning (SciML) and data assimilation. The performance of discrete-time CGKN
is demonstrated on several canonical problems governed by nonlinear PDEs with
intermittency and turbulent features, including the viscous Burgers' equation,
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the 2-D Navier-Stokes equations, with
which we show that the discrete-time CGKN framework achieves comparable
performance as the state-of-the-art SciML methods in state forecast and
provides efficient and accurate DA results. The discrete-time CGKN framework
also serves as an example to illustrate unifying the development of SciML
models and their other outer-loop applications such as design optimization,
inverse problems, and optimal control.

Abstract: Symbolic accelerators are increasingly used for symbolic data processing in
domains such as genomics, NLP, and cybersecurity. However, these accelerators
face scalability issues due to excessive memory use and routing complexity,
especially when targeting a large set. We present AutoSlim, a machine
learning-based graph simplification framework designed to reduce the complexity
of symbolic accelerators built on Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
deployed on FPGA-based overlays such as NAPOLY+. AutoSlim uses Random Forest
classification to prune low-impact transitions based on edge scores and
structural features, significantly reducing automata graph density while
preserving semantic correctness. Unlike prior tools, AutoSlim targets automated
score-aware simplification with weighted transitions, enabling efficient
ranking-based sequence analysis. We evaluated data sets (1K to 64K nodes) in
NAPOLY+ and conducted performance measurements including latency, throughput,
and resource usage. AutoSlim achieves up to 40 percent reduction in FPGA LUTs
and over 30 percent pruning in transitions, while scaling to graphs an order of
magnitude larger than existing benchmarks. Our results also demonstrate how
hardware interconnection (fanout) heavily influences hardware cost and that
AutoSlim's pruning mitigates resource blowup.

of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To
mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the
data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization
(RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining
RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a
range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL
benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统MoE模型的路由不可微且不灵活，同时稀疏性模式不利于低资源设备加速。

Method: 结合ReLU和RMSNorm的路由器，设计CLS感知训练目标，实现高效加速内核。

Result: BlockFFN在token级和chunk级稀疏性上优于基线，加速内核在端侧设备上实现3.67倍速度提升。

Conclusion: BlockFFN架构在性能和加速上均优于现有MoE模型，适用于低资源场景。

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 分布式优化在大规模信号处理和机器学习中至关重要，但通信开销是主要瓶颈。现有的低秩梯度压缩方法要么方差高，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: GreedyLore结合误差反馈纠正贪婪压缩引入的偏差，并引入半懒惰子空间更新确保压缩算子始终保持收缩性。

Result: 理论证明GreedyLore在标准优化器（如MSGD和Adam）下达到收敛速度O(σ/√NT + 1/T)，首次实现低秩梯度压缩的线性加速收敛。

Conclusion: 实验验证了GreedyLore的有效性，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and
machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck.
Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are
approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising
remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy
compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly
chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical
performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving
strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this
gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression
algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees.
GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy
compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the
compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these
techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD
and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank
gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

Motivation: RaCRL旨在减少由环境随机性引起的罕见且灾难性约束违规的几率，但传统方法因保守探索易导致次优策略。

Method: 提出ORAC方法，通过最大化奖励值函数的局部上界和最小化风险规避成本值函数的局部下界来构造探索性策略，动态调整成本权重以满足安全约束。

Result: 实验证明ORAC能有效避免次优策略，显著改善连续控制任务中的奖励-成本权衡。

Conclusion: ORAC方法在平衡探索和安全性方面表现优异，适用于复杂任务如Safety-Gymnasium和CityLearn。

Abstract: Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies
that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations
caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads
to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in
converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,
in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an
exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic
(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper
confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a
local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value
function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value
is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint
value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the
environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety
constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach
prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the
reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as
Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment
CityLearn.

Conclusion: 强调了开发更可靠的基于LLM的评估方法的紧迫性，并分享了改进后的模型和数据集。

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

Motivation: 研究旨在揭示因果抽象在无限制对齐映射下的局限性，并探讨模型信息编码假设的必要性。

Method: 通过理论证明和实验验证，分析了无限制对齐映射的潜在问题，尤其是使用随机初始化的语言模型进行实验。

Result: 研究发现，无限制对齐映射会导致因果抽象变得无意义，即使模型无法完成任务，也能实现完美映射。

Conclusion: 因果抽象不足以实现机械可解释性，需要结合信息编码假设。未来研究应关注这两者的关系。

Abstract: The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the
opaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural
network can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a
function which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability
papers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear
representation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a
model's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by
the definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the
concept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment
maps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural
network can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of
causal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical
findings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to
perfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of
solving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised
language models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention
accuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear
representation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to
alignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled
way to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and
accuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:
causal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it
becomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.
Studying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal
abstraction should lead to exciting future work.

enabling holistic understanding and efficient processing of large tables. We
design a multi-step schema linking plan to derive a focused table schema that
retains only query-relevant information, eliminating ambiguity and alleviating
hallucinations. This focused table schema provides precise and sufficient table

Result: 提供了一种分析对抗动态的原理性方法，并为降低越狱风险奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 通过博弈论和主动防御策略，有效应对LLM的越狱挑战。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the "Purple Agent," which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.

Result: 展示了推理均衡与经典纳什结果的差异，为LLM系统中的战略互动提供了新基础。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究认知约束、思维表达和认识学习提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce the LLM-Nash framework, a game-theoretic model where agents
select reasoning prompts to guide decision-making via Large Language Models
(LLMs). Unlike classical games that assume utility-maximizing agents with full
rationality, this framework captures bounded rationality by modeling the
reasoning process explicitly. Equilibrium is defined over the prompt space,
with actions emerging as the behavioral output of LLM inference. This approach
enables the study of cognitive constraints, mindset expressiveness, and
epistemic learning. Through illustrative examples, we show how reasoning
equilibria can diverge from classical Nash outcomes, offering a new foundation
for strategic interaction in LLM-enabled systems.

Conclusion: 适应性探索需平衡未知与可控，为认知理论和高效强化学习提供了新见解。

Abstract: What drives an agent to explore the world while also maintaining control over
the environment? From a child at play to scientists in the lab, intelligent
agents must balance curiosity (the drive to seek knowledge) with competence
(the drive to master and control the environment). Bridging cognitive theories
of intrinsic motivation with reinforcement learning, we ask how evolving
internal representations mediate the trade-off between curiosity (novelty or
information gain) and competence (empowerment). We compare two model-based
agents using handcrafted state abstractions (Tabular) or learning an internal
world model (Dreamer). The Tabular agent shows curiosity and competence guide
exploration in distinct patterns, while prioritizing both improves exploration.
The Dreamer agent reveals a two-way interaction between exploration and
representation learning, mirroring the developmental co-evolution of curiosity
and competence. Our findings formalize adaptive exploration as a balance
between pursuing the unknown and the controllable, offering insights for
cognitive theories and efficient reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 通过参数化接地方法，可在表达性和可扩展性之间灵活权衡。

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to
process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order
Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A
fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,
which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a
(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all
possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic
knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground
formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other
methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more
computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees
of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking
inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a
parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward
Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly
employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off
between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental
results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as
important as the NeSy method itself.

Result: 在IID和非IID数据分布下，准确率分别提升了6.84%和7.25%。

Conclusion: 多模态QFL结合MMA机制显著优于现有方法，适用于现实任务。

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) has been recently introduced to enable a
distributed privacy-preserving quantum machine learning (QML) model training
across quantum processors (clients). Despite recent research efforts, existing
QFL frameworks predominantly focus on unimodal systems, limiting their
applicability to real-world tasks that often naturally involve multiple
modalities. To fill this significant gap, we present for the first time a novel
multimodal approach specifically tailored for the QFL setting with the
intermediate fusion using quantum entanglement. Furthermore, to address a major
bottleneck in multimodal QFL, where the absence of certain modalities during
training can degrade model performance, we introduce a Missing Modality
Agnostic (MMA) mechanism that isolates untrained quantum circuits, ensuring
stable training without corrupted states. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed multimodal QFL method with MMA yields an improvement in accuracy
of 6.84% in independent and identically distributed (IID) and 7.25% in non-IID
data distributions compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool
usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational
misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable
to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated
threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we
propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents,
enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and
sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including
benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and
define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed
sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows
fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and
self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we
demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to
security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results
show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the
groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在推理能力上有所提升，但在动态空间交互方面仍存在不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用创新数据管道生成高质量数据样本，并结合动态多任务训练策略，优化模型性能。

Result: M2-Reasoning-7B在8个基准测试中达到新的SOTA，尤其在空间推理领域表现卓越。

Conclusion: M2-Reasoning-7B通过数据与训练策略的创新，成功提升了模型的动态空间交互能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), have
significantly enhanced their reasoning abilities. However, a critical gap
persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability
essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce
M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial
reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.AI

Motivation: 由于时间和资源限制，手动获取伦理需求具有挑战性且优先级低，因此需要一种自动化方法。

Method: 在多代理LLM设置中引入伦理倡导代理，根据系统描述提出伦理建议。通过两个案例研究验证框架效果。

Result: 框架能捕获研究人员在30分钟访谈中确定的大部分伦理需求，并引入额外相关需求。

Conclusion: 虽然框架有助于推广伦理需求工程，但可靠性问题表明仍需人工反馈。

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential
for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics
requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple
stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints.
Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation
process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements
drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting.
This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system
description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from
different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics
requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and
introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also
highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing
the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can
facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering
process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Conclusion: 框架为LLM的可信系统化推理提供有前景的方向。

Abstract: Structured reasoning over natural language inputs remains a core challenge in
artificial intelligence, as it requires bridging the gap between unstructured
linguistic expressions and formal logical representations. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through
a two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic
generation. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural
language queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the
problem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the
lower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows
or executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision
making. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit
constraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem
solving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the
framework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly
refines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.
Experiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with
accuracy gains reaching as high as 40\%. Moreover, the bi-level design enhances
transparency and error traceability, offering a promising step toward
trustworthy and systematic reasoning with LLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法提升了信息质量、推理能力和专业表达，有望缩短罕见病患者的诊断周期。

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,
suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease
patients.

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models~(\textbf{LSLMs}) demonstrate strong
potential in response latency and speech comprehension capabilities, showcasing
general intelligence across speech understanding tasks. However, the ability to
follow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of
datasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,
previous approaches have used Large Language Models~(\textbf{LLMs}) to continue
the linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.
Yet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the
continuation methods further amplify these shortcomings. Given the high costs
of collecting and annotating speech instruction datasets by humans, using
speech synthesis to construct large-scale speech instruction datasets has
become a balanced and robust alternative. Although modern
Text-To-Speech~(\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis
quality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text
instruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution
in TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework
with multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and
validate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality
speech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments
show that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more
suitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,
increasing data usability from 72\% to 93\%. It also demonstrates unique
advantages in rewriting tasks that require complex knowledge and
context-related abilities.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决早期工程设计中的复杂迭代推理问题，现有大型语言模型（LLM）工作流在任务连续性和生成可执行模型方面存在不足。

Method: 采用结构化的多智能体系统（MAS）和双智能体系统（2AS）进行比较，引入设计状态图（DSG）作为JSON可序列化的表示方法，并通过实验（60次）评估性能。

Result: MAS在生成更详细的DSG方面表现更好，但需求覆盖率低（<20%），代码兼容性在MAS中平均低于50%，2AS在特定设置下达到100%。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体系统能增强设计细节，推理优化的LLM提高了完成率，但仍存在需求覆盖和代码兼容性问题。

Abstract: Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.

Result: 实验表明，Leanabell-Prover-V2在MiniF2F测试集上性能提升了3.2%（使用Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B）和2.0%（使用DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B）。

Abstract: We introduce our Leanabell-Prover-V2, a 7B large language models (LLMs) that
can produce formal theorem proofs in Lean 4, with verifier-integrated Long
Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT). Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we
continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further
performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially,
verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors,
allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning
process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly
optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions,
together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward
strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by
3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set. The source codes, curated data

Motivation: 现有AI Agent依赖复杂的提示工程和外部推理框架，但受限于LLM的自然语言理解能力和高推理成本。

Method: 设计了LLM-Read代码提示，使LLM能按代码执行程序化对话推理，内部实现自省和反思，减少外部迭代成本。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，INoT平均性能提升7.95%，平均节约58.3%的token成本。

Conclusion: INoT通过内部自省机制有效提升了推理效率，并在图像任务中展现了通用性。

Abstract: AI Agents rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal-LLMs (MLLMs) to
perform interpretation and inference in text and image tasks without
post-training, where LLMs and MLLMs play the most critical role and determine
the initial ability and limitations of AI Agents. Usually, AI Agents utilize
sophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a
promising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought
and Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent
limitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative
reasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,
we propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought
(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute
programmatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.
Therefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,
which can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six
benchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,
with an average improvement of 7.95\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.
Furthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best
performing method at baseline by 58.3\%. In addition, we demonstrate the
versatility of INoT in image interpretation and inference through verification
experiments.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

Motivation: 传统的LoRA权重矩阵初始化方法通常是随机初始化且固定秩，本文旨在通过数据驱动的方法改进收敛性和性能。

Method: 将LoRA初始化视为域迁移问题，通过多个约束条件将预训练和微调激活关联，提出了无训练的闭式权重估计方法，并支持可变秩矩阵初始化。

Result: 在图像生成、分类和理解等下游任务中，CNTLoRA优于标准和数据驱动的权重初始化方法。

Conclusion: CNTLoRA提供了更快的收敛速度和更高的性能，并通过实验验证了其设计选择的合理性。

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

Key words: 动态交互, 单目视频, 3D重建, 模态补全, 时序一致性

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单目视频的动态人-物交互重构框架，通过模态补全和时序一致性提升遮挡场景下的重建精度。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 传统3D重建方法假设静态对象或完全可视的动态主体，导致在遮挡和时序不一致场景中性能下降。

Method: 结合模态补全推断遮挡区域的完整结构，并利用时序上下文增强重建的一致性和稳定性。

Result: 在单目视频中使用3D高斯喷洒验证，显示处理遮挡和保持时序稳定性方面的优越性。

Conclusion: 该模板无关方法显著提升了动态场景中复杂细节的恢复能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: 尽管精确建模键盘交互仍有挑战，但NeuralOS为实现自适应神经界面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 深度学习在医学图像分析中有显著进展，但模型的大规模和缺乏透明度限制了其临床应用。

Method: 利用可解释性技术（如DL-Backtrace、分层相关性传播和集成梯度），选择性保留每层最相关部分，实现目标压缩。

Result: 在多个医学图像分类基准测试中，该方法实现了高压缩率和最小精度损失。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗环境中轻量级、可解释性模型的部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有的生成概念瓶颈模型依赖辅助视觉线索，影响了模型的解释性和组合性，因此需要一种新的模型来解决这些问题。

Method: 使用扩散能量函数引导，通过明确的概念传输所有信息，支持概念组合和否定等干预。

Result: 在 CelebA-HQ 数据集上实验表明，CoCo-Bot 在概念控制性和解释性上优于先前模型，同时保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot 是一种有效的解决方案，能够提升生成模型的可控性和解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于单一癌症类型，缺乏跨癌症泛化能力，而临床实践中需要更强的稳健性。

Method: 引入SDIR和CADE模块：前者增强弱模态特征，后者合成目标域分布。

Result: 在四种癌症类型上的实验显示其泛化性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 为跨癌症多模态预后提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务特定架构和领域微调，难以统一处理多任务匹配问题。

Method: 采用2D位移估计框架，结合跨领域特征提取器和大型视觉模型的特征转换管道。

Result: PanMatch在跨任务评估中优于UniMatch和Flow-Anything，并在异常场景中表现出前所未有的零样本性能。

Conclusion: PanMatch展示了基于通用框架的多任务匹配的潜力，为领域泛化提供了新方向。

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

Conclusion: SHC通过保留语义结构改进了哈希码的区分性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Multilayer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) and its variants have proven to
be an effective technique for the classification of different natural signals
such as audio, video, acoustic and images. In this paper, a Hybrid Multilayer
Extreme Learning Machine (HML-ELM) that is based on ELM-based autoencoder
(ELM-AE) and an Interval Type-2 fuzzy Logic theory is suggested for active
image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

Conclusion: VFMTok展示了在图像生成任务中的高效性和高质量，无需依赖分类器无关的指导。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的3D重建方法具有广阔的应用前景，但需要在模型精度、可扩展性和动态场景处理等方面进一步研究。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

Conclusion: 该研究为未来文档基础模型的统一设计提供了指导，尤其适用于非标准文档类型的识别。

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Result: 在肺部CT和腦部MRI數據集上驗證，放射組學特徵提升了檢索特異性，APE支持基於位置的搜索。

Conclusion: 框架靈活且高效，適用於診斷、治療計劃和大規模醫學影像研究。

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in
computer vision due to fine-grained inter-species variation and high
intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this
suggests additional work can be done on metadata selection and domain-adapted
multi-modal learning. Our code is available at

tumor segmentation that integrates spatial-language-vision information through
bidirectional interactive attention mechanisms to improve segmentation accuracy
and boundary delineation. Methods: We propose two core components: Multi-modal
Semantic Fusion Adapter (MSFA) integrating 3D MRI data with clinical text
descriptions through hierarchical semantic decoupling, and Bidirectional
Interactive Visual-semantic Attention (BIVA) enabling iterative information
exchange between modalities. The framework was evaluated on BraTS 2020 dataset
comprising 369 multi-institutional MRI scans. Results: The proposed method
achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D
U-Net. Ablation studies confirmed critical contributions of semantic and
spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal

containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

Motivation: 当前图像数据集的构建依赖耗时的手工收集和标注，而人工生成数据不如真实世界数据有价值，因此提出了一种自动从真实图像构建数据集的新方法。

Method: 使用DatasetAgent系统，协调四个MLLMs智能体和图像优化工具包，根据用户需求自动构建高质量图像数据集。

Result: 在扩展现有数据集和从头创建新数据集的实验中，DatasetAgent构建的数据集成功用于训练多种视觉模型，包括图像分类、目标检测和图像分割任务。

Conclusion: DatasetAgent为高质量图像数据集的自动构建提供了高效可靠的解决方案，克服了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

Motivation: 地球系统观测（ESO）中，卫星图像多样且类间相似性高，现有对比学习框架在多标签对齐和语义精确性上存在不足。

Method: MoSAiC框架结合了模态内和模态间的对比学习，并引入了多标签监督对比损失，专为多模态卫星图像设计。

Result: 在BigEarthNet V2.0和Sent12MS数据集上，MoSAiC在精度、聚类一致性和泛化能力上均优于全监督和自监督基线。

Conclusion: MoSAiC为多模态卫星图像提供了更精细的语义解耦和更鲁棒的表示学习，适用于低标签和高类重叠场景。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Method: 将内存控制建模为序列决策问题，采用强化学习方法优化SAM 2的记忆更新机制。

Result: 在过拟合设置下，该方法相对SAM 2的改进超过现有启发式方法的三倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习在内存控制中展现了巨大潜力，是手工规则的有力替代。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

Result: 模型在MNIST数据集上达到99.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 深层特征提取和充足的原型覆盖对高性能至关重要，适用于更广泛的模式识别任务。

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT 为灵活、场景感知的基础设施建模奠定了基础，框架已开源。

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 由于SAM及其变体在各领域的广泛应用，高效压缩这类模型成为迫切需求。

Method: Birkhoff提出超压缩算法和专用线性层算子HyperLinear，将高维参数向量转化为低维标量，并加速推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Birkhoff在压缩比、后压缩性能和推理速度上表现优异，如5.17x的压缩比且性能下降小于1%。

Conclusion: Birkhoff是一种高效、快速的SAM压缩方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频生成器要么与标准LLM架构不同，要么依赖笨重的外部文本编码器，或存在高延迟问题，Lumos-1旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用3D RoPE和MM-RoPE方案增强时空相关性，通过AR-DF策略解决帧间损失不平衡问题。

Conclusion: Lumos-1成功解决了现有视频生成器的架构和效率问题，并通过创新方法提升了性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Conclusion: 研究表明，意识是一种阻塞相，通过长程关联将知识组件内在连接，且传统的阻塞相变热力学原理同样适用于神经网络中的意识涌现。

Abstract: This paper develops a neural jamming phase diagram that interprets the
emergence of consciousness in large language models as a critical phenomenon in
high-dimensional disordered systems.By establishing analogies with jamming
transitions in granular matter and other complex systems, we identify three
fundamental control parameters governing the phase behavior of neural networks:
temperature, volume fraction, and stress.The theory provides a unified physical
explanation for empirical scaling laws in artificial intelligence,
demonstrating how computational cooling, density optimization, and noise
reduction collectively drive systems toward a critical jamming surface where
generalized intelligence emerges. Remarkably, the same thermodynamic principles
that describe conventional jamming transitions appear to underlie the emergence
of consciousness in neural networks, evidenced by shared critical signatures
including divergent correlation lengths and scaling exponents.Our work explains
neural language models' critical scaling through jamming physics, suggesting
consciousness is a jamming phase that intrinsically connects knowledge
components via long-range correlations.

Conclusion: 生成式AI可以有效支持产品发现阶段，但需进一步改进以解决通用性和情感同理心的问题。

Abstract: Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such
as Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment.
However, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming,
cognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and
empirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate
proto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to
evaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,
and the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study
with 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative
and quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency
by reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of
personas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
scoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially
regarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations
related to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although
cognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy
varied significantly across participants. These results contribute novel
empirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software
Product Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be
addressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.

Main category: cs.SE

Motivation: 动态环境中的工作负载变化、硬件更新和系统升级导致配置与性能关系的概念漂移，传统离线学习方法难以实时适应。

Method: DHDA采用双层次适应机制：上层通过重新划分数据并局部模型重训练处理全局漂移；下层通过异步调整局部模型处理局部漂移。

Result: 实验表明，DHDA在八个软件系统中显著提升了准确性，适应性提高2倍，同时降低了冗余计算。

Conclusion: DHDA能有效处理不同层次的概念漂移，提升性能模型在动态环境中的适应性。

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate
configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic
environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates
will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,
which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and
local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,
existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to
these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration
performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online
configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to
these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the
local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper
level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the
local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the
lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and
adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA
combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize
redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight
software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA
achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with
up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to
improve different local models in handling concept drift.

PyRadiomics Dimensionality reduction was applied with 56 feature selection and
extraction algorithms and 27 classifiers were benchmarked A semi supervised
learning SSL framework with pseudo labeling utilized 478 unlabeled and 499
labeled cases Model sensitivity was tested in three scenarios varying labeled
data in SL increasing unlabeled data in SSL and scaling both from 10 percent to
100 percent SHAP analysis was used to interpret predictions Cross validation
and external testing in two cohorts were performed.
  Results: SSL outperformed SL, improving overall survival prediction by up to
17 percent. The top SSL model, Random Forest plus XGBoost classifier, achieved
0.90 accuracy in cross-validation and 0.88 externally. SHAP analysis revealed
enhanced feature discriminability in both SSL and SL, especially for Class 1
survival greater than 4 years. SSL showed strong performance with only 10
percent labeled data, with more stable results compared to SL and lower
variance across external testing, highlighting SSL's robustness and cost
effectiveness.
  Conclusion: We introduced a cost-effective, stable, and interpretable SSL
framework for CT-based survival prediction in lung cancer, improving
performance, generalizability, and clinical readiness by integrating SHAP
explainability and leveraging unlabeled data.

Main category: quant-ph

Motivation: 量子神经网络（QNN）的安全性尚未充分研究，本文填补了这一空白。

Method: 利用量子门的酉特性和Hadamard门叠加性设计攻击（QuPTs）。

Result: 实验显示QuPTs隐蔽性强，最多导致QNN准确率下降23%。

Conclusion: 本研究首次揭示了完全独立的QNN中存在特洛伊攻击风险。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of
quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the
quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed
Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum
gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop
Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly
stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically
QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the
compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network
independent of any hybrid classical-quantum architecture.

Motivation: 尽管PQC在量子机器学习中广泛应用，但在量子化学相关数据上的研究仍不足，因此需要探索其在这些领域的实际潜力与局限。

Method: 构建168种PQC（结合14种数据编码策略和12种变分基），在5和16量子位电路上评估性能，分析电路结构、深度和训练集大小的影响，并测试在当前量子硬件上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，PQC在化学相关问题上仍面临挑战，这些问题对经典机器学习方法较为简单，但对量子方法仍具有难度。

Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits
(PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates --
provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning
problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited
exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we
investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically
meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies
for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water
conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions
are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the
data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set
of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational
ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits.
Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model
performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth
and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the
performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both
noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings
underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that
are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain
non-trivial for quantum approaches.

Motivation: 解决机器学习和数据科学中的稀疏凸优化问题，通过量子算法提升计算效率。

Method: 针对向量域和矩阵域分别设计量子算法，利用函数值预言机降低查询复杂度。

Result: 向量域算法将经典算法的复杂度降低至$O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$和$O(1/\varepsilon)$，矩阵域算法将时间复杂度降低至$\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$和$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$。

Conclusion: 量子算法在稀疏凸优化问题中优于经典方法，尤其在维度依赖性上表现更优。

Abstract: This paper considers the projection-free sparse convex optimization problem
for the vector domain and the matrix domain, which covers a large number of
important applications in machine learning and data science. For the vector
domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we propose two quantum algorithms
for sparse constraints that finds a $\varepsilon$-optimal solution with the
query complexity of $O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$ by using
the function value oracle, reducing a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ and $O(d)$ over
the best classical algorithm, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension. For the
matrix domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, we propose two
quantum algorithms for nuclear norm constraints that improve the time
complexity to $\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ and
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$ for computing the update step, reducing at
least a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ over the best classical algorithm, where $r$ is
the rank of the gradient matrix. Our algorithms show quantum advantages in
projection-free sparse convex optimization problems as they outperform the
optimal classical methods in dependence on the dimension $d$.

Conclusion: 该研究为QML提供了更现实的威胁建模方法和主动防御框架，有助于推动这一新兴领域的安全性发展。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems inherit vulnerabilities from classical
machine learning while introducing new attack surfaces rooted in the physical
and algorithmic layers of quantum computing. Despite a growing body of research
on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion
to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these
threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about
attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the
development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue
that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface,
capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships,
prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose
adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to
the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured
reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage
attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation,
persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we
present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding
stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE
ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between
physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data
and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and
privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference). This
work provides a foundation for more realistic threat modeling and proactive
security-in-depth design in the emerging field of quantum machine learning.

Main category: eess.SP

Motivation: 由于控制和通信系统的强相互依赖性，需要共同设计无线网络控制系统。研究目标是确保约束（如PAoI、传输功率和可调度性）满足的同时优化性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：优化理论阶段推导变量间的关系并简化问题；安全深度强化学习阶段通过师生框架指导DRL代理。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该框架在收敛速度、奖励和稳定性方面优于基于规则和其他优化理论的DRL基准。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在超可靠无线网络控制系统中实现了约束满足和性能优化的双重目标。

Abstract: In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication
systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper
presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction
while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The
approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age
of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability
in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely
derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and
maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The
framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first
stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships
among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage
employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent
(student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system
constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive
simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other
optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher
rewards, and greater stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 现有方法主要使用固定距离度量（如Kendall's τ距离），缺乏从数据中学习距离度量的方法。然而，排名在不同上下文中会表现出不同的特征（如体育比赛中的长距离交换）。

Method: 论文提出了一个广义的Mallows模型，具体关注Lα距离，并开发了FPTAS用于高效生成接近真实分布的样本。进一步提出了MLE算法，联合估计中心排名、分散参数和最优距离度量。

Result: 实验验证了提出的方法在体育排名数据集上的有效性，并证明了估计量的一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了Mallows模型的应用范围，能够更灵活地适应不同上下文中的排名数据。

Abstract: \textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning
from ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and
voting to aligning language models with human
preferences~\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic,
rafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy
perturbations of a central ranking $\sigma$, with likelihood decaying
exponentially in distance from $\sigma$, i.e, $P (\pi) \propto \exp\big(-\beta
\cdot d(\pi, \sigma)\big),$ where $\beta > 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a
distance function.
  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\tau$
distance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly
from data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for
instance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team
beating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by
this, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance
metric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\alpha$ distances:
$d_\alpha(\pi,\sigma):=\sum_{i=1} |\pi(i)-\sigma(i)|^\alpha$.
  For any $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta>0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time
Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are
$\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even
in the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that
required vanishing dispersion ($\beta\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we
propose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly
estimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal
distance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for
any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically
using datasets from sports rankings.

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 现有方法通常单独处理偶然性或认知性不确定性，而CLEAR旨在平衡两者以实现更好的条件覆盖。

Method: CLEAR使用两个参数γ₁和γ₂，兼容任何偶然性和认知性估计器，例如分位数回归和PCS框架的集成方法。

Result: 在17个数据集中，CLEAR的区间宽度平均改善了28.2%和17.4%，同时保持名义覆盖。

Conclusion: CLEAR在不确定性高的场景中表现尤为突出，显著提升了预测模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification is critical for reliable predictive
modeling, especially in regression tasks. Existing methods typically address
either aleatoric uncertainty from measurement noise or epistemic uncertainty
from limited data, but not necessarily both in a balanced way. We propose
CLEAR, a calibration method with two distinct parameters, $\gamma_1$ and
$\gamma_2$, to combine the two uncertainty components for improved conditional
coverage. CLEAR is compatible with any pair of aleatoric and epistemic
estimators; we show how it can be used with (i) quantile regression for
aleatoric uncertainty and (ii) ensembles drawn from the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for epistemic
uncertainty. Across 17 diverse real-world datasets, CLEAR achieves an average
improvement of 28.2% and 17.4% in the interval width compared to the two
individually calibrated baselines while maintaining nominal coverage. This
improvement can be particularly evident in scenarios dominated by either high
epistemic or high aleatoric uncertainty.

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 批量归一化在深度网络中被广泛使用，但其基于样本的均值和方差估计在对抗攻击下可能不鲁棒，因此需要改进。

Method: 应用Stein收缩估计器替换BN中的样本均值和方差估计，并在图像分类和分割任务中测试其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Stein收缩估计器在BN中显著提升了对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，并在多任务中取得了领先效果。

Abstract: Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks
used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training.
BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances,
respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature
maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of
Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the
mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In
this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and
variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence
of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian
distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein
shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in
image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks.
We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a
standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using
CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using
HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.

Result: 实验表明MIRRAMS在多种基准数据集上优于现有基线，且在不同缺失场景下表现稳定。

Conclusion: MIRRAMS是一个强大且通用的学习框架，适用于缺失数据及半监督学习任务。

Abstract: In real-world data analysis, missingness distributional shifts between
training and test input datasets frequently occur, posing a significant
challenge to achieving robust prediction performance. In this study, we propose
a novel deep learning framework designed to address such shifts in missingness
distributions. We begin by introducing a set of mutual information-based
conditions, called MI robustness conditions, which guide a prediction model to
extract label-relevant information while remaining invariant to diverse
missingness patterns, thereby enhancing robustness to unseen missingness
scenarios at test-time. To make these conditions practical, we propose simple
yet effective techniques to derive loss terms corresponding to each and
formulate a final objective function, termed MIRRAMS(Mutual Information
Regularization for Robustness Against Missingness Shifts). As a by-product, our
analysis provides a theoretical interpretation of the principles underlying
consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, such as
FixMatch. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets show that
MIRRAMS consistently outperforms existing baselines and maintains stable
performance across diverse missingness scenarios. Moreover, our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance even without missing data and can be
naturally extended to address semi-supervised learning tasks, highlighting
MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf framework for general-purpose learning.

Main category: stat.ML

Motivation: 现有的方法虽然在理论上可以达到近似最优的遗憾，但在实践中往往计算复杂或表现不佳，因此需要一种既能保证理论最优性又在实际中高效的算法。

Method: BLAE 算法将臂消除与正则化的 G-最优设计相结合，并采用新的批量优化设计和精细浓度边界分析技术。

Result: BLAE 在所有情境（大 K 和小 K）下首次实现了极小极大最优遗憾（对数因子内），仅需 O(loglog T) 批次，且在实际测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BLAE 是首个在所有情境下同时具备理论最优性和实践优势的批量线性 bandit 算法。

Abstract: We study the linear bandit problem under limited adaptivity, known as the
batched linear bandit. While existing approaches can achieve near-optimal
regret in theory, they are often computationally prohibitive or underperform in
practice. We propose \texttt{BLAE}, a novel batched algorithm that integrates
arm elimination with regularized G-optimal design, achieving the minimax
optimal regret (up to logarithmic factors in $T$) in both large-$K$ and
small-$K$ regimes for the first time, while using only $O(\log\log T)$ batches.
Our analysis introduces new techniques for batch-wise optimal design and
refined concentration bounds. Crucially, \texttt{BLAE} demonstrates low
computational overhead and strong empirical performance, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in extensive numerical evaluations. Thus,
\texttt{BLAE} is the first algorithm to combine provable minimax-optimality in
all regimes and practical superiority in batched linear bandits.

Result: 损失深度框架继承了机器学习算法的计算效率和统计收敛速度，适用于高维数据，并在异常检测中表现良好。

Conclusion: 损失深度提供了一种易解释且高效的数据深度方法，特别适用于高维数据和异常检测任务。

Abstract: Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how
central is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as
anomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across
various fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising
the notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety
of depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.
Taking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the
halfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of
classifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the
set of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of
"loss depths", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or
logistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits
computational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as
their fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the
high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a
connection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity
of the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation
as a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for
anomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.

Abstract: Watermarking technology has gained significant attention due to the
increasing importance of intellectual property (IP) rights, particularly with
the growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) on billions
resource-constrained edge devices. To counter the potential threats of IP theft
by malicious users, this paper introduces a robust watermarking scheme without
retraining or fine-tuning for transformer models. The scheme generates a unique
key for each user and derives a stable watermark value by solving linear
constraints constructed from model invariants. Moreover, this technology
utilizes noise mechanism to hide watermark locations in multi-user scenarios
against collusion attack. This paper evaluates the approach on three popular
models (Llama3, Phi3, Gemma), and the experimental results confirm the strong
robustness across a range of attack methods (fine-tuning, pruning,
quantization, permutation, scaling, reversible matrix and collusion attacks).

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of wounds and scale markers in clinical images remainsa
significant challenge, crucial for effective wound management and
automatedassessment. In this study, we propose a novel dual-attention U-Net++
archi-tecture, integrating channel-wise (SCSE) and spatial attention mechanisms
toaddress severe class imbalance and variability in medical images
effectively.Initially, extensive benchmarking across diverse architectures and
encoders via 5-fold cross-validation identified EfficientNet-B7 as the optimal
encoder backbone.Subsequently, we independently trained two class-specific
models with tailoredpreprocessing, extensive data augmentation, and Bayesian
hyperparameter tun-ing (WandB sweeps). The final model ensemble utilized Test
Time Augmentationto further enhance prediction reliability. Our approach was
evaluated on a bench-mark dataset from the NBC 2025 & PCBBE 2025 competition.
Segmentationperformance was quantified using a weighted F1-score (75% wounds,
25% scalemarkers), calculated externally by competition organizers on
undisclosed hard-ware. The proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8640,
underscoring itseffectiveness for complex medical segmentation tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

Motivation: 解决体数据（如MRI）基础模型开发中计算复杂性和数据量不足的挑战。

Result: 在10项任务中表现优于现有方法（提升3%-14%），且无需训练成本。

Conclusion: Raptor是高效的医学体数据基础模型解决方案，兼具性能与通用性。

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.

Conclusion: CL3R通过整合3D空间与语义信息，解决了视角泛化问题，为机器人精细操作提供了鲁棒的感知模块。

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

Motivation: 卫星在动态和不确定环境中自主运行时，传统控制器和现有DRL算法在实时适应性和容错性上表现不足，需要开发更可靠的控制策略。

Method: 提出TD3-HD方法，结合Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)、Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)和Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC)，以提升稀疏奖励环境中的学习能力和故障时的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，TD3-HD在姿态误差、角速度调节和稳定性方面显著优于PD控制和其他DRL算法（如TD3、PPO、A2C）。

Conclusion: TD3-HD作为一种具备容错能力的AI解决方案，适合自主卫星姿态控制，提升了故障条件下的系统性能。

Abstract: Reliable satellite attitude control is essential for the success of space
missions, particularly as satellites increasingly operate autonomously in
dynamic and uncertain environments. Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role
in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is
critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However,
traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall
short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for
autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control
strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault
conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in
sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures.
The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL
algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower
attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability
under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential
as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite
attitude control.

Conclusion: xpSHACL提升了SHACL验证的可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF
data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users
need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation
engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for
non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an
explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining
rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable
explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage
of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and
consistency.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，哈希方法显著快于标准贪心算法，且结果质量几乎相当。

Conclusion: 哈希方法是高效且有竞争力的模式集挖掘解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Pattern set mining, which is the task of finding a good set of patterns
instead of all patterns, is a fundamental problem in data mining. Many
different definitions of what constitutes a good set have been proposed in
recent years. In this paper, we consider the reconstruction error as a proxy
measure for the goodness of the set, and concentrate on the adjacent problem of
how to find a good set efficiently. We propose a method based on bottom-k
hashing for efficiently selecting the set and extend the method for the common
case where the patterns might only appear in approximate form in the data. Our
approach has applications in tiling databases, Boolean matrix factorization,
and redescription mining, among others. We show that our hashing-based approach
is significantly faster than the standard greedy algorithm while obtaining
almost equally good results in both synthetic and real-world data sets.

Abstract: In this work, we aimed to replicate and extend the results presented in the
DiffFluid paper[1]. The DiffFluid model showed that diffusion models combined
with Transformers are capable of predicting fluid dynamics. It uses a denoising
diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) framework to tackle Navier-Stokes and
Darcy flow equations. Our goal was to validate the reproducibility of the
methods in the DiffFluid paper while testing its viability for other simulation
types, particularly the Lattice Boltzmann method. Despite our computational
limitations and time constraints, this work provides evidence of the
flexibility and potential of the model as a general-purpose solver for fluid
dynamics. Our results show both the potential and challenges of applying
diffusion models to complex fluid dynamics problems. This work highlights the
opportunities for future research in optimizing the computational efficiency

Abstract: There is an imperative need to provide quality of life to a growing

personalised for each participant according to their preferences and context.
We formulate requirements that are specific to each individual as properties
encoded in Linear Temporal Logic and use a model checker to verify whether each
property is satisfied by the model. When a property is violated, a
counterexample is generated giving the cause of the violation. We demonstrate
the framework's generalisability by applying it to different participants,

Motivation: 解决iBCI中长期存在的神经记录非平稳性问题，现有方法依赖固定神经身份且需要测试时标签或参数更新，限制了跨会话的泛化能力。

Method: 引入SPINT框架，采用无序神经单元集合操作，结合上下文依赖的位置嵌入方案和动态通道丢弃正则化方法。

Result: 在FALCON Benchmark的三组多会话数据集上，SPINT表现优于现有的零样本和少样本无监督基线，无需测试时对齐和微调。

Conclusion: SPINT为长期iBCI应用提供了一个鲁棒且可扩展的神经解码框架。

Abstract: Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCI) aim to decode behavior from
neural population activity, enabling individuals with motor impairments to
regain motor functions and communication abilities. A key challenge in
long-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the
composition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across
recording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit
alignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require
test-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across
sessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In
this work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural
Transformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on
unordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel
context-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers
unit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording
sessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows
few-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from
the test session. To further promote model robustness to population
variability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for
iBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We
evaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,
covering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT
demonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing
zero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for
test-time alignment and fine-tuning. Our work contributes an initial step
toward a robust and scalable neural decoding framework for long-term iBCI
applications.

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在检索任务中表现优异，但数据集的扩展和更新对评估和训练标签质量提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human
annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage
collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document
collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage
collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found
that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although
they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally,
the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some
questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training
labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we
discuss in this report.

Motivation: 解决现有图基 RAG 方法因检索过程中信息提取不完整和查询信息利用不足导致的图谱质量差问题。

Method: 提出多部分图索引（Chunks、Units、Entities）、混合提取策略和 Q-Iter 查询驱动迭代检索策略。

Result: 在三个 QA 基准测试中显著优于现有方法，最高提升 99.33% Accuracy 和 113.51% F1 分数，同时降低 72.58% 索引成本。

Conclusion: CUE-RAG 是一种高效且成本效益高的图基 RAG 系统解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
performance in question answering (QA) remains limited by the lack of
domain-specific and up-to-date knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
addresses this limitation by incorporating external information, often from
graph-structured data. However, existing graph-based RAG methods suffer from
poor graph quality due to incomplete extraction and insufficient utilization of
query information during retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we propose
CUE-RAG, a novel approach that introduces (1) a multi-partite graph index
incorporates text Chunks, knowledge Units, and Entities to capture semantic
content at multiple levels of granularity, (2) a hybrid extraction strategy
that reduces LLM token usage while still producing accurate and disambiguated
knowledge units, and (3) Q-Iter, a query-driven iterative retrieval strategy
that enhances relevance through semantic search and constrained graph
traversal. Experiments on three QA benchmarks show that CUE-RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 99.33% higher Accuracy
and 113.51% higher F1 score while reducing indexing costs by 72.58%.
Remarkably, CUE-RAG matches or outperforms baselines even without using an LLM
for indexing. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency
of CUE-RAG in advancing graph-based RAG systems.

Abstract: Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments,
supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many
long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making
them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a
description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and
supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential
for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that
converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective
retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using
weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a
large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity
description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy
from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.

Main category: q-fin.ST

Motivation: 当前代理框架缺乏规范性模型构建步骤，主要依赖情感或趋势分析，该研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一种代理系统，利用LLM迭代发现随机微分方程，生成风险指标，并在传统回测和市场模拟器中评估。

Result: 模型指导的交易策略优于标准LLM代理，提升了多股票的夏普比率。

Conclusion: 结合LLM与代理模型发现可增强市场风险估计并提高交易决策的盈利能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks,
in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal.
While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in
finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead
on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an
agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential
equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which
inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional
backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally
plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading
strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across
multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model
discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 当前6G网络中智能任务的实现需要独立的知识获取管道，导致数据冗余和解释不一致，亟需统一解决方案。

Method: 提出KP-A网络知识平面，将知识获取与管理与智能逻辑解耦，提供直观一致的知识接口。

Result: KP-A在实时网络知识问答和边缘AI服务编排中验证了其有效性，所有实现已开源。

Conclusion: KP-A简化了智能代理的开发与维护，提升了互操作性，为未来标准化奠定基础。

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems is enabling
autonomous 6G networks with advanced intelligence, including
self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-healing. However, the current
implementation of individual intelligence tasks necessitates isolated knowledge
retrieval pipelines, resulting in redundant data flows and inconsistent
interpretations. Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN
(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified
Network Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.
By decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence
logic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for
intelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge
interface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence
agents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live
network knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration. All implementation
artifacts have been open-sourced to support reproducibility and future
standardization efforts.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了6G移动网络中AI原生无线接入网（RAN）的设计与标准化原则，提出了三个关键能力，并通过大规模现场试验验证了其性能提升。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.NI

Motivation: 与5G相比，6G需要从一开始就集成AI/ML以应对复杂性并支持无处不在的AI应用。

Method: 提出AI原生RAN的框架，包括AI驱动的RAN处理/优化/自动化、可靠的AI生命周期管理和AI即服务（AIaaS）三项关键能力。

Result: 通过5000多个5G-A基站的现场试验，验证了架构和AI功能在接口延迟、根因识别和网络能耗方面的显著改进。

Conclusion: 本文为6G AI原生RAN的标准化设计提供了一个Day 1框架，平衡了技术创新与实际部署。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) has become the most certain
and prominent feature of 6G mobile networks. Unlike 5G, where AI/ML was not
natively integrated but rather an add-on feature over existing architecture, 6G
shall incorporate AI from the onset to address its complexity and support
ubiquitous AI applications. Based on our extensive mobile network operation and
standardization experience from 2G to 5G, this paper explores the design and
standardization principles of AI-Native radio access networks (RAN) for 6G,
with a particular focus on its critical Day 1 architecture, functionalities and
capabilities. We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its
three essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization
direction; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable
AI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The
standardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including
an AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale
field trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered
significant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause
identification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture
and the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework
for 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation
with practical deployment.

Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large
audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech,
sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder
trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3
modalities of speech, sound, and music; (ii) flexible, on-demand thinking,
allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering;

enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets
curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL,
AF-Think, and AF-Chat, and train AF3 with a novel five-stage curriculum-based
training strategy. Trained on only open-source audio data, AF3 achieves new
SOTA results on over 20+ (long) audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks,
surpassing both open-weight and closed-source models trained on much larger

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 评估现代语言识别和说话人识别方法在多语言说话人和跨年龄录音中的表现。

Method: 使用UNESCO的广播录音数据集测试现成的语言识别和说话人识别方法。

Result: 语言识别系统（如Whisper）能较好处理第二语言和口音，但说话人嵌入受通道、年龄和语言影响较大。

Conclusion: 说话人识别方法需克服偏见才能用于档案的说话人索引。

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century
radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language
identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with
respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our
findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at
handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings
remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be
overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于离散扩散模型的音频修复方法，适用于较长时间的缺失片段修复。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 现有方法在修复超过100毫秒的音频缺失片段时质量下降，需要一种更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 通过预训练的音频标记器生成离散潜在空间中的标记，直接在该空间中建模生成过程。

Result: 在MusicNet和MTG数据集上测试，修复效果优于基线方法，特别是在较长的缺失片段（300-500毫秒）中表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为音频修复提供了稳定且连贯的解决方案，适用于较长缺失片段的修复。

Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in
corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and
spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps,
they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this
work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion
modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a
pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process
directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically
coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the
MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap
durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset,
extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing
baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for
restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method

Key words: 音乐表演合成，神经网络，MIDI，音频生成，VALLE

TL;DR: MIDI-VALLE 是一种基于神经网络的语言模型，用于从音乐乐谱生成富有表现力的音频表演，显著优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 传统音乐表演合成模型难以适应多样的MIDI来源和音乐风格。

Method: 改进VALLE框架，以参考音频和MIDI为条件，将MIDI和音频编码为离散标记。

Result: 在ATEPP和Maestro数据集上，Frechet Audio Distance降低了75%以上，听众测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: MIDI-VALLE在合成质量和泛化能力上显著优于基线模型。

Abstract: Generating expressive audio performances from music scores requires models to
capture both instrument acoustics and human interpretation. Traditional music
performance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating
expressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into
audio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across
diverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address
these challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted
from the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot
personalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio
synthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio
performance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that
rely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens,
facilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances.
Furthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an
extensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that
MIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving
over 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets. In the
listening test, MIDI-VALLE received 202 votes compared to 58 for the baseline,
demonstrating improved synthesis quality and generalisation across diverse
performance MIDI inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.SD

Motivation: 现有文本到音频生成方法因数据质量和数量有限，难以处理含有时序控制的复杂文本提示，需要新的方法来支持长文本的时序精确控制。

Method: 使用LLM规划非重叠时间窗口并重新描述，结合注意力解耦与聚合、上下文潜在组合和参考指导技术实现时序控制和音频一致性。

Result: FreeAudio在无需训练的方法中实现了最先进的时序控制音频合成质量，并在长文本生成上与训练方法效果相当。

Conclusion: FreeAudio为时序控制的长文本音频合成开辟了新途径，具有高效和高质量的优点。

Abstract: Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved promising results with the recent
advances in generative models. However, because of the limited quality and
quantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle
to handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,
"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s". Recent works have explored data augmentation
techniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable
timing-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is
still limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled
T2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled
long-form T2A generation, e.g., "owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping
at 0s-24s". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time
windows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based
on the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and
Aggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent
Composition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.
Extensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art
timing-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is
comparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates
comparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and
paves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis. Demo samples are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: cs.HC

Motivation: 由于主题分析的资源密集性限制了其在大型研究中的应用，研究者希望利用LLM的自动化文本分析能力来缓解这一挑战。

Method: 研究使用OpenAI的GPT-4o模型，结合RISEN提示框架，与人工分析方法（Dedoose）进行对比，评估了代码开发、饱和点和主题合成的表现。

Result: LLM与人工在父代码开发上相似，但在子代码和主题合成上人工更优。知识库LLM比无知识库模型和人工更快达到饱和点。

Conclusion: LLM在心理健康研究中可提高效率，但需结合人工监督以平衡资源与深度。

Abstract: Thematic analysis provides valuable insights into participants' experiences
through coding and theme development, but its resource-intensive nature limits
its use in large healthcare studies. Large language models (LLMs) can analyze
text at scale and identify key content automatically, potentially addressing
these challenges. However, their application in mental health interviews needs
comparison with traditional human analysis. This study evaluates out-of-the-box
and knowledge-base LLM-based thematic analysis against traditional methods
using transcripts from a stress-reduction trial with healthcare workers.
OpenAI's GPT-4o model was used along with the Role, Instructions, Steps,
End-Goal, Narrowing (RISEN) prompt engineering framework and compared to human
analysis in Dedoose. Each approach developed codes, noted saturation points,
applied codes to excerpts for a subset of participants (n = 20), and
synthesized data into themes. Outputs and performance metrics were compared
directly. LLMs using the RISEN framework developed deductive parent codes
similar to human codes, but humans excelled in inductive child code development
and theme synthesis. Knowledge-based LLMs reached coding saturation with fewer
transcripts (10-15) than the out-of-the-box model (15-20) and humans (90-99).
The out-of-the-box LLM identified a comparable number of excerpts to human
researchers, showing strong inter-rater reliability (K = 0.84), though the
knowledge-based LLM produced fewer excerpts. Human excerpts were longer and
involved multiple codes per excerpt, while LLMs typically applied one code.
Overall, LLM-based thematic analysis proved more cost-effective but lacked the
depth of human analysis. LLMs can transform qualitative analysis in mental
healthcare and clinical research when combined with human oversight to balance
participant perspectives and research resources.

Result: 该模型在合成和多样化人类运动数据集上显著优于现有方法，且能在高噪声条件下稳定运行。

Conclusion: 该模型实时性能优异，适用于人机交互、康复医学和运动控制研究。

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along
with pre-trained model weights, are made publicly available at

Conclusion: 该方法为阿尔茨海默病等认知障碍患者提供了一种隐私保护的情感识别方案。

Abstract: Emotion detection in older adults is crucial for understanding their
cognitive and emotional well-being, especially in hospital and assisted living
environments. In this work, we investigate an edge-based, non-obtrusive
approach to emotion identification that uses only physiological signals
obtained via wearable sensors. Our dataset includes data from 40 older
individuals. Emotional states were obtained using physiological signals from
the Empatica E4 and Shimmer3 GSR+ wristband and facial expressions were
recorded using camera-based emotion recognition with the iMotion's Facial
Expression Analysis (FEA) module. The dataset also contains twelve emotion
categories in terms of relative intensities. We aim to study how well emotion
recognition can be accomplished using simply physiological sensor data, without
the requirement for cameras or intrusive facial analysis. By leveraging
classical machine learning models, we predict the intensity of emotional
responses based on physiological signals. We achieved the highest 0.782 r2
score with the lowest 0.0006 MSE on the regression task. This method has
significant implications for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementia (ADRD), as well as veterans coping with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) or other cognitive impairments. Our results across multiple classical
regression models validate the feasibility of this method, paving the way for
privacy-preserving and efficient emotion recognition systems in real-world
settings.

Conclusion: AIRS是一种高效、可定制的家庭康复解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Ambient Intelligence Rehabilitation Support (AIRS)
framework, an advanced artificial intelligence-based solution tailored for home
rehabilitation environments. AIRS integrates cutting-edge technologies,
including Real-Time 3D Reconstruction (RT-3DR), intelligent navigation, and
large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), to create a comprehensive system for
machine-guided physical rehabilitation. The general AIRS framework is
demonstrated in rehabilitation scenarios following total knee replacement
(TKR), utilizing a database of 263 video recordings for evaluation. A
smartphone is employed within AIRS to perform RT-3DR of living spaces and has a
body-matched avatar to provide visual feedback about the excercise. This avatar
is necessary in (a) optimizing exercise configurations, including camera
placement, patient positioning, and initial poses, and (b) addressing privacy
concerns and promoting compliance with the AI Act. The system guides users
through the recording process to ensure the collection of properly recorded
videos. AIRS employs two feedback mechanisms: (i) visual 3D feedback, enabling
direct comparisons between prerecorded clinical exercises and patient home
recordings and (ii) VLM-generated feedback, providing detailed explanations and
corrections for exercise errors. The framework also supports people with visual
and hearing impairments. It also features a modular design that can be adapted
to broader rehabilitation contexts. AIRS software components are available for
further use and customization.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络方法依赖静态或手动定义的股票依赖关系，难以捕捉动态变化和层次特征。

Method: 提出EP-GAT，通过能量差异和Boltzmann分布生成动态股票图，并采用并行图注意力机制保留层次动态特征。

Result: 实验表明，EP-GAT在多个数据集和指标上优于其他基线模型，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: EP-GAT能有效建模动态股票依赖和层次特征，提升预测性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable performance in forecasting stock
movements, which arises from learning complex inter-dependencies between stocks
and intra-dynamics of stocks. Existing approaches based on graph neural
networks typically rely on static or manually defined factors to model changing
inter-dependencies between stocks. Furthermore, these works often struggle to
preserve hierarchical features within stocks. To bridge these gaps, this work
presents the Energy-based Parallel Graph Attention Neural Network, a novel
approach for predicting future movements for multiple stocks. First, it
generates a dynamic stock graph with the energy difference between stocks and
Boltzmann distribution, capturing evolving inter-dependencies between stocks.
Then, a parallel graph attention mechanism is proposed to preserve the
hierarchical intra-stock dynamics. Extensive experiments on five real-world
datasets are conducted to validate the proposed approach, spanning from the US
stock markets (NASDAQ, NYSE, SP) and UK stock markets (FTSE, LSE). The
experimental results demonstrate that EP-GAT consistently outperforms
competitive five baselines on test periods across various metrics. The ablation
studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis further validate the
effectiveness of each module in the proposed method.

multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal
tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video
inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful problem-solving
capabilities, in particular when organized in multi-agent systems. However, the
advent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a
complex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While
measuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well
multi-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these
systems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose
AgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration
from classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet
measures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies
for problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a
network topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet
including homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic
protocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs
are already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to
fall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent
benchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size
and can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier
models in a setup with up to 100 agents.

Abstract: What should a function that extrapolates beyond known input/output examples
look like? This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function
matching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct
extrapolant. We argue that a "good" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of
rules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following
in list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when
certain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to
express such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our
paper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant
functions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some
basic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map
equivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter
equivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial
structures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which
constructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it
behaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.

Abstract: The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research
and predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due
to the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their
reputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective,
potential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber
incident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to
optimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven
methods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational
features in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a
novel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with
entity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a
multilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident
types (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and
Others) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual
frequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore
dependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations
are observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML
techniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by
InsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance
prediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only
using conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent,
entity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and
proactive cyber risk mitigation. It provides insurers and organizations with
data-driven insights to support decision-making and compliance planning.

*Peng Qiu,Hanqi Feng,Barnabas Poczos*

Key words: 抗菌肽（AMP），溶血毒性（HC50），ProtT5/ESM2，交叉注意力，可解释性

TL;DR: AmpLyze是一种预测抗菌肽（AMP）溶血毒性（HC50）的模型，通过序列分析提供定量预测和解释，优于现有方法。

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Main category: q-bio.BM

Motivation: 现有模型仅能判断抗菌肽的毒性（'有毒'或'无毒'），无法提供定量预测和解释。AmpLyze旨在填补这一空白。

Method: AmpLyze结合了残基级ProtT5/ESM2嵌入和序列级描述符，通过双分支（局部和全局）和交叉注意力模块进行训练，使用log-cosh损失函数减少噪声干扰。

Result: AmpLyze的PCC为0.756，MSE为0.987，优于传统回归方法和现有技术。交叉注意力模块进一步提升了1%的PCC和3%的MSE。

Conclusion: AmpLyze将溶血毒性评估转化为定量、基于序列且可解释的预测，为AMP设计和早期毒性筛选提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for
antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic"
or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value
from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model
couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in
dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained
with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model
reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors
and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential,
and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement.
Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest
safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative,
sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design
and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.
